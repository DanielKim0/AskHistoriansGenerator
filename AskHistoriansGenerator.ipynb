       "['What we group together as the \"nobility\" in Hungary actually changed throughout medieval and early modern Hungary. In the beginning, nobles were the leading office-holders around the ruler. This meaning overlapped after the mid-twelfth century with the idea that a nobleman is one whose ancestry is noble. After the fourteenth century, though, nobility really meant landowners. Owning land meant possessing \"free landholdings\" and \"based on these landholdings, the nobility was beneficiary of the common law and of political freedom.\" (Quote from Akos Timon, Magyar alkotmany es jogtortenet, p. 122; For an English source, see Martyn Rady, Nobility, Land and Service in medieval Hungary, pp. 1-6). As nobility status became dependent on landowning, inheritance was one way to make new nobles quickly. By the fourteenth century, Hungarian nobles used to divide their lands between their sons, which led to some sons inheriting 12 households, half villages, a few mills or so. Doing so increased the number of nobles but also the share of impoverished ones. Some nobles were just immersed into the peasantry, as they were unable to live off the surplus of food their own peasants produced. As some of them accumulated debt in vain attempt to live like nobility was supposed to live in the rich gentry fiction that abounded, many lost their meager inheritance. (See Rady above, esp. chapter 3). The fiction of the serving nobility that owns land in return for their service lasted way longer than the reality behind it. The rights and privileges of the nobility were codified first in the Golden Bull of 1222, but it was only in 1608 that the unicameral Hungarian Diet, which represented the nobility, broke into two houses; only the titled aristocracy gained spots in the upper house. The lower nobility, in due course, often became service nobility without land. They could become retainers of barons but also, especially after the eighteenth century, just rich men who could afford to buy a title. William O. McCagg, Jr., published in 1972 a book about Jewish Nobles and Geniuses in Modern Hungary which reconstructs \"the function relation between the ennoblement of Hungary\\'s Jewish capitalists and the emergence of Hungary\\'s great scientists onto the international stage\", though he includes converted Jews as well. 346 Jewish families were ennobled between 1800 and 1918, which hints at another step in the development of the Hungarian nobility: a mark of wealth for the higher echelons of the bourgeoise, for whom this was a coveted prize.',\n",
       " \"This is an incomplete answer, since murder is hardly the only crime against humanity, but every analysis I've seen shows that homicide rates are decreasing drastically over time. Long-term trends in homicide rates in Europe and the US show that they've decreased by 90% or more over the past few centuries. I believe the European data in that graph come from here To address your question of record-keeping, the cause of death was often recorded in village records, including whether it was the result of a murder. If we assume that we're better at reporting murder rates today than they were back then (e.g. in cases of spousal abuse), the trends we see represent a conservative estimate of the improvement in homicide rates; in reality, we've probably seen a greater improvement than these graphs show. Here is a TED talk that tracks the decline in violence worldwide, including deaths due to warfare. In short, if you compare two people, one born hundreds of years ago, and one born in the past century, the one born hundreds of years ago is far more likely to have died as a result of violence.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'m no expert about eastern europe, so I will talk mostly about Italy, where I live and whose history I know but I hope it\\'s not too different. The Austrian empire was not an empire such as the british or french, because it was not based on the conquest of large areas of land and the complete destruction of previous forms of power. The austrian empire was not even austrian, it was the empire of the House of Habsburg, that starting in the 1100s in switzerland slowly built their power inside the holy roman empire and europe through marriages and wars. For instance Lombardy was gained following the death of the last spanish Habsburg and a war between the Bourbons of France and the Habsburg of Austria (war of spanish succession) to settle the division of the lands owned by the spanish side of the Habsburg, and the Habsurg ruled as legitimate rulers of the land due to dinastic and feudal law. This is quite different for instance by the situation of most of africa or india that was annexed following the dissolution of chartered companies that de facto ruled the land (such as the east india compnay for british india or the royal niger company for Nigeria). So the lands they owned were ruled no differently from austria, with local nobles and cities that obeyed the Habsburg emperor as their liege and often had large privileges and immunities dictated by centuries of customs and negotiations between liege and vassal. The austrian ruled Lombardy no differently than austria, and often brought good innovations such as the creation of a moder cadastre in lombardy (an enormous work that took 40 years), navigable channels and a progressive reductions of feudal priviledges, especially clerical ones, that hampered growth and prosperity. This system worked fairly well up until the french revolution, revolts were presents but they were generally caused by specific problems (like food scarcity or some tax considered too high): nothing too serious and nothing that questioned the austrian rule directly, such revolts happened all the time. Things changed with napoleon Italians for the first time in centuries experienced some level of self goverment, causing an increase in the hate against foreign rulers; due to the rising nationalism people started to feel that things could be better without austria. In particular people in lombardy and in the recently annexed veneto felt that taxes on italian goods were too high and kept that way too support austrian artisans against the superior italian goods; an important italian politicians of the time, Carlo Cattaneo, for instance justified the 1848 revolt saying that lombardy-veneto alone payed 1/3 of the taxes of the empire despite only housing 1/8 of the population. Following the increase in the activity of secret nationalistic organisations such as the \"Carboneria\" the austrian repression increased. Many intellectuals were arrested or sentenced to death or deported to the infamous, in italy, Spielberg prison in Brno, czech republic. This repression was hard but obviusly not at level seen in the colonies, for instance when the population of Milan stopped buying tobacco during the so called \"smoke strike\" the austrian autorities were not able to significantly repress the sitution. So to sum up and answer your questions, as with all authoritarian states life in the regions under austrian control was not ideal, especially when the legitimacy of dinastic right as reason to control an area was questioned and the austrian regime did try to extract wealth from the area with heavy taxes but the population was not enslaved or mistread like in african or spanish colonies.',\n",

       " \"This is a very interesting and frequently asked question about Hinduism, and while there isn't a definitive answer to it, I will lay out certain facts and analysis regarding Krishna that may explain why many Hindu deities are often depicted with dark blue skin. 1) Krishna appears to be an amalgamation of several deities of ancient India. The earliest of these is Vāsudeva, a god-hero belonging to the Vrishni tribe of Dwarka. His worship is attested in the writings of the ancient Indian scholar Pānini, as well as in the epigraphy of the Heliodorus pillar. It is thought that at a certain point the Vrishni tribe fused with the Yadava tribe, which worshipped a god-hero named Krishna. As the two tribes coalesced, so did their deities into a single deity that appears in the Mahabharata. Later in the 4th century CE, the pastoral tradition of Bal Gopal, with its lively and joyful stories of a mischievous child deity, was absorbed into the Krishna tradition. Hence we get the impression of an unbroken Krishna story, from childhood to adolescence to manhood, but it's more likely a synthesis of various traditions and folk stories. 2) Now the different deities that form Krishna may have been depicted in different ways by different groups of people who worshipped them, but we're going to be looking at the tradition that might explain the blue skin of the god, and that's the pastoral tradition. In the pastoral tradition, Krishna is depicted as a young, mischievous child deity who plays a flute with magical effects, luring the innocent and the heedless from the certainties of an well-ordered society. He also invariably wears peacock feathers in his crown, which are suggestive of a forest. 3) Krishna is not mentioned in any of the ancient Indo-Aryan compositions of the Vedic period (1500 BCE - 600 BCE). Instead he first appears in the Mahabharata, which was composed during the classical era, somewhere between 400 BCE and 300 CE. It is generally assumed that the Indo-Aryans had paler skin than the previous inhabitants of the Indian subcontinent. Based on these three points, it can be argued that Krishna's dark blue skin is indicative of his non-Aryan, tribal origin. But as I said at the start, there's no definitive answer to the question, so I could very well be wrong. But if the explanation is correct, that would also explain why other deities, such as Rama, Shiva and Kali, are also depicted in a similar manner.

       " 'To the best of my knowledge, direct ownership of slaves by companies, universities, or governments did not typically happen. Slaves, more than other forms of property, were held by individuals rather than in common. Why? I don’t honestly have a good answer, but I would venture an expert in early American law could provide some explanations. The one exception I’m aware of are religious orders. The Jesuits who ran Georgetown University managed several plantations in Maryland and sold slaves in 1832 to held settle the debts of the school. It should be said that this was in direct contradiction of the orders given them for the disposition of the slaves. While they did not directly own slaves, these organizations profited greatly from slavery. The US government hired huge numbers of slaves to work on public works projects, military facilities, and the like. The contracts were often extremely favorable to the owners and could be a significant source of income for smaller slave holders. Businesses and universities were often funded and managed by slave owners and slave traders. Brown and Yale are named for men who made their fortunes as slave traders. The sale of personal slaves by leaders of the organizations were often used to retire debts and expand their operations. So, while they may not have had slaves on their ledgers, they certainly profited from it and it allowed them to expand and survive.',\n",
       " 'Greetings! This question depends on several things. Firstly, what do we mean by global conflict? Below are a trio of possible interpretations with relevant accompanying responses: Global in the military sense: In this sense, yes, the First World War was a global conflict. Although the majority of literature and coverage of the war focuses on the trenches of the Western Front or the conditions on the Eastern Front (or even the \"lesser-known\" Alpine Front between Italy and Austria-Hungary), there were spots of conflict all across the world. The Japanese seized the German Empire\\'s lease of land in Qingdao (Tsingtao) after a brief siege in November 1914. The German East Asia squadron fought the Royal Navy down south near the Falklands Island, and the \"Löwe von Afrika\" (Lion of Africa) general Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck led a superb guerilla campaign against British and Indian troops in East Africa with a motley force of colonial troops (really recommend further researching this one, makes for excellent stories). Granted, fighting never went as far as the actual shores of North or South America, but in terms of sheer scale, only the Seven Years War (1756 - 1763) compares (and in some respects exceeds) it. Global in the political sense: again, a resounding yes here. Though we often focus heavily on the role of the European and American governments in this war, there were parties heavily invested (though not necessarily in terms of active combatant soldiers) in the war. The Chinese Nationalist Government believed that choosing a side would help on the path to ridding China of the western imperialist influence, a wish represented by the dispatching of the Chinese Labour Corps to assist the Entente on the Western Front. In the Middle East, you have likely heard of Lawrence of Arabia\\'s guerilla campaign, most notably against the Hejaz Railway of the Ottoman Empire, in which he managed to gain the support and fighting power of the various Arab tribes who were promised (and denied) an independent homeland after the war. Even Latin America was transformed by the war, with economic effects and political decisions framed by the larger events in Europe. Global in the economic sense: this might be one of the \"kind of\" senses in which the First World War was a global war. I am somewhat restricted here by my utter lack of economics knowledge, but the First World War left massive economic scars in some belligerents, and even elevated others. National economies were harnessed for war, with rationing and government regulation committees such as the American War Industries Board. Even other nations which were not involved in the fighting were impacted by the decline of imports from combatant nations (Latin America most notably). Hope this brief overview helps, and feel free to ask any-followups as you see fit!

       " 'Underlying this question is an assumption that the writers of the Federalist Papers had an accurate understanding of history. Hamilton, Jay, and Madison were obviously highly educated men, but something that becomes clear when studying the Revolutionary period is the extent to which its intellectual leaders had incomplete understandings of history, shaped by conspiratorial thinking that saw usurpation by elites and political decline around every corner. Conspiratorial thinking flowed as a deep undercurrent in the river of Revolutionary era thought. To many of the era\\'s writers, Britain was under assault from a cabal bent on destroying the British constitution and enriching themselves at the expense of the people. If it\\'s not clear what or who I mean by this ministerial cabal, well, that\\'s because Revolutionary era writers weren\\'t all that clear about it. There was simply a vague sense that someone, somewhere was trying to manipulate Parliament and British political institutions to their own greedy ends. One popular target of colonial ire was Robert Walpole, considered the first Prime Minister of Great Britain. Other targets were members of the aristocracy who were believed to be bending Parliament to their will. Whether or not these accusations were accurate is besides the point; the point is that Revolutionary era writers strongly believed them. All of these conspiracies, naturally, drove the intellectual engine of Revolution; it was feared that Britain was already irrevocably on the path towards complete destruction of individual liberty, and that America would be close behind. And this brings us to the Founding generation\\'s understanding of history. The political writers of the time found historical parallels to their situation--of shady cabals bent on destroying freedom for personal gain--in Poland, Denmark, France, and above all, ancient Rome. Their understanding of these events was often incomplete; it is hard to credit their simplistic belief that the Polish or the Danish were a \"free\" people until all that was suddenly taken away by a self-serving aristocracy. There is also a remarkable Orientalist view that India, China, and the Ottomans had always been under such despotic rulership and had never experienced freedom. Nevertheless, these writers held these (distorted) historical parallels deeply in their hearts, and these served as a kind of argumentative vocabulary as the writers thought about their situation and eventually made the case for independence. For these era\\'s thinkers, the mere existence of the ephors and gerousia, which were in some sense popularly elected, was enough to make Sparta a republic. It is important to remember here that the \"free\" Britain these writers lamented did not have universal suffrage in any sense of the word, and neither did the America they envisioned (universal white male suffrage would take until the Jacksonian Era, and in some states even longer). So the highly limited nature of \"suffrage\" in Ancient Sparta would not have looked so strange or undemocratic to them. Finally, it was enough for Britain to be in the grips of a sinister ministerial cabal for it to be descending into despotism. Never mind that Parliament still existed, and was in some sense popularly elected; it had, to the minds of Revolutionary era thinkers, become fatally infected with despotism.

       " 'We don\\'t have an interview with any of the sex workers involved, but we do have one with the person who hired them. ... The CIA\\'s obsession with Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) began with a report received by Allen Dulles (later CIA Director) that the KGB had purchased 50 million doses worth of LSD from a laboratory in Switzerland. Dulles had been interested in the idea of truth serums and mind control -- other drugs had been experimented with during WWII without much success -- and this gave the germ of the idea that LSD might work (it was rumored to be the most powerful mind control agent ever discovered). After investigation it was discovered the lab in question (Sandoz Laboratories, they\\'re still around) had only produced a fraction of the rumored amount and the KGB had actually purchased only 10 grams. Still, the US was interested, and they bought the lab\\'s remaining stock (not that much, but presumably they were able to secure more). A plan was eventually devised masterminded by George H. White of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (and CIA consultant) where an apartment would be set up in New York and uniwitting subjects would be brought in and dosed with LSD while watched behind a one-way mirror. The results were, as White said, unpredictable, and he named the drug \"Stormy\". Experiments continued, inside and outside the New York apartment, including in prisons. San Francisco was another secret location, and that\\'s where the sex was mixed in. George H. White called it Operation Midnight Climax. The one-way mirror was still in; the office portion was covered with bondage posters and Toulouse-Latrec cancan dancers. White hired a man named Ike Feldman, who had been undercover in the Bay Area crime scene. According to Feldman, he had a dialogue with White like this: White: You\\'ve been doing one hell of a job as an undercover man. Now I\\'m gonna give you another assignment. We want you to test these mind-bending drugs. Feldman: Why the hell do you want to test mind-bending drugs? White: Have you ever heard of The Manchurian Candidate? Well, that\\'s why we have to test these drugs, to find out if they can be used to brainwash people. Now, on to your question: you suggest there was \"training\" involved. This was not the case. Feldman took on a new element to his criminal persona in order to recruit sex workers who \"all thought I was a racketeer\". That is, the women didn\\'t know they were working for the CIA! Feldman paid them $50 to $100 per night to take johns to the apartment where they would receive the LSD dose via drugged drink (as usual) and have sex with the women (this was the new part). Feldman explains the purpose was to try to bring out more of the imagined \"truth serum\" effect: \"with these drugs, you could get information without having to abuse people\". In addition to LSD, the CIA tested sex-enhancement drugs, like papavarine (intended to be injected directly into the penis). One incident Feldman recalls involves having sex workers lure some Russian sailors from a boat in dock and combining LSD with a drug White called the \"Sextender\". There was, as a later ethics report indicated, \"no informed consent, no real independent review, and no follow-up to assess damage.\" One other story Feldman tells -- and I don\\'t have independent verification on this, but it\\'s reasonably plausible -- is that they asked Feldman to have a Cuban woman on his \"payroll\" help with one of the schemes to get Castro (LSD-laced cigars; they never made it to Castro). This is the closest I know of to a sex worker from Midnight Climax being involved in anything more than an experiment, but even if she was asked, she wasn\\'t involved with the final plot. ...

       " \"The Imperial Japanese Navy's strategic and tactical doctrine made sense given the naval geography they were facing. Unlike the British and Germans in the North Sea in WWI, any enemy the IJN was likely to face would have to fight a fleet action to achieve its objectives. However, they expected any war to be a quick affair, rather than a long, drawn out slog; in this, they were overly influenced by their victory in the Russo-Japanese War. In the North Sea in WWI, it was hard for either side to force a fleet action. This was for the simple reason that the risks of losing your fleet represented an existential threat. For the British, without the Grand Fleet, the Germans could break the British blockade, and possibly even invade. For the Germans, the High Seas Fleet stopped the British opening up supply routes to Russia through the Baltic, as well as preventing an invasion of the North Sea coast. The status quo, meanwhile, was more acceptable to both sides. For the British, the blockade was an eventual war-winner, while for the Germans, it would not bite until restrictions on shipping to neutral powers were properly enforced in 1916-17; even then, it was still possible that they could win the war before the civilian population starved. As such, avoiding a battle that might have a catastrophic ending was the sensible choice. In the Pacific, though, it was much easier to force a battle. The American colony of the Philippines and the British colonies of Malaya, Singapore and Hong Kong were isolated, far from the main fleet bases of their respective powers. The Japanese could easily capture or threaten them, forcing a fleet to be dispatched to relieve or recapture them. For the commanders of this force, the status quo was, (at least in theory) equivalent to the result of losing the fleet. The Japanese would still be in control of the captured colony. Fighting, and trying to recapture the colony, made sense. Both British and American planning for a war with Japan corresponded to Japanese expectations. Both navies intended to dispatch a fleet with the express goal of liberating or reinforcing their colonies in the Far East, before making offensive moves against Japan's trade. Jutland, meanwhile, did not prove that a fleet that did not want to fight could not be forced to. In the interwar period, it was regularly reanalysed in naval academies around the world. It was wargamed again and again, to tease out the mistakes each commander made. It became clear that, for example, had Jellicoe turned towards Scheer instead of turning away to avoid torpedo attack, it would have been much harder for Scheer to escape. Had the commanders of Jellicoe's light forces kept him updated on their positions, Jellicoe would have been able to get into a position to ambush Scheer on the morning of the 1st June 1916. Had Beatty conserved his force better, he might have been able to cut off Scheer's retreat. The general conclusion drawn from these wargames was not that Jutland proved that a fleet could always avoid action, but that aggressive manoeuvring was required to force one. Technological changes did not significantly affect this strategic thinking either. While there were technological changes that made it easier to carry out a commerce-raiding strategy, this did not really threaten Japan. Cruisers, submarines and aircraft could all attack trade, but they needed bases to refuel, rearm and resupply. Japan depended mainly on short-range trade, between Japan, Korea, Taiwan and its colonies in China. This was hard to interrupt without bases close to Japan. The British plan, War Memorandum (Eastern), required the British force to establish a forward base, likely in the Ryukyu Islands, from which cruisers, subs and aircraft could establish an effective blockade. Setting up this base would give further impetus to fight a fleet action. After all, the base could not be established and sustained if the Japanese fleet could attack the convoys it would rely on. As far as the geopolitical sitution of Japan goes, you are right that they could not exert decisive power over the homelands of Britain or America. They could not invade either, or force either power to a crushing defeat as the Americans and British did to them. However, they were not intending or expecting to do so. They wanted to protect their interests in East Asia and the Western Pacific, to colonise these areas as the British and Americans had done. Capturing the Philippines or Malaysia would not represent an existential threat to America or Britain, you are right; but this meant that either power would be willing to give them up in a peace treaty. The Japanese expected to be able to capture these colonies, defeat the fleet that was coming to rescue them, and then present whoever they were fighting with a done deal. The Japanese controlled the colony, there was nothing that could be done to retake it, and so the only option that was available to accept it and sign a peace treaty in Japan's favour. This was the aspect where Japanese planning was most influenced by the Russo-Japanese War. Here, the Japanese had threatened or captured Russian colonies in the Far East, then crushed the fleet that was intended to relieve them. They did not try to invade further into Russia, to take more. The peace treaty confirmed Japanese control of many of these colonies - Port Arthur, the southern half of Sakhalin - as well as preventing the Russians interfering further with Japan's colony of Korea. The problem here was that the Japanese underestimated American resolve. They would not accept a peace treaty, see Japanese control of the Philippines as a fait accompli, but instead chose to fight on, to draw out the war and bring their industrial might to bear. This was not a problem of naval strategy, but more an issue of diplomatic and political misreading. Japan's naval strategy made perfect sense for the war it was expecting to fight. It was that expectation that was flawed. I should also note that Japanese tactics were not purely the battleship-centred tactics of WWI. By WWII, they had shifted to a complex combined-arms approach, albeit one that would end with a battleship action. Aircraft carriers, submarines and night attacks by cruisers and destroyers would be use to whittle down an enemy force as it approached. The battlefleet would then fight a long-range action, in line, against the remaining enemy battlefleet. This compensated for the relative weakness of the IJN compared to the British and American navies. As far as the naval doctrines of the other two major powers went, I've discussed them here, in a tactical context To summarize it, both the British and Americans planned for a fleet action. The Americans focused on fighting a long-range fleet action, with carriers scouting and helping to defend the fleet from enemy attacks. The British, meanwhile, adopted a combined-arms approach. Carriers were to find and fix the enemy fleet, slowing it down through their strikes, while also protecting the fleet against enemy air attack. The battleships would then fight using 'divisional tactics', splitting up into multiple groups rather than operating in a single line. This would allow them to manouvre such that the enemy line was always at a disadvantageous position relative to one of the groups. They wanted to fight a closer-ranged action, quite possibly at night. On a more strategic level, the British did not seek to fight a decisive action as the Japanese did. The fleet was seen as a tool to protect Britain's colonies and enable commerce raiding. This might require acting as a fleet in being, but might equally entail fighting a major fleet action. The Americans, meanwhile, were more interested in fighting a decisive battle. The main American plan for a war against Japan involved the fleet fighting across the Pacific to relieve the Philippines. It would then fight a decisive action to crush the Japanese fleet, allowing American commerce raiders to strangle Japan's trade.\",\n",
       " '/u/thefourthmaninaboat has provided a great answer already, but I will add in a bit on Japanese doctrine that I wrote in a previous answer. (What is doctrine? In a nutshell, it\\'s how a military conceptualizes fighting and winning a war -- it operates a level above both tactics and strategy, and drives decisions such as fleet acquisition and composition.) Japan was quite aware that a long war against the U.S. was not winnable. Their war aims were to secure the resources of Southeast Asia (in particular oil, but also rubber and other industrial supplies). They couldn\\'t do that with a U.S. presence in the Philippines. So their overall war plan, which saw successive revisions throughout the decades before 1941, was to quickly defeat colonial powers in Southeast Asia, and to build a defensive perimeter that the U.S. fleet would be attrited by before a final annihilating battle, after which the U.S. would sue for peace. The idea was that the American fleet, steaming west, would have to face Japanese air power and submarine attacks before making it to the vicinity of the Philippines or the home islands, where it would be decisively beaten. To that end, the Japanese fleet\\'s composition emphasized quality over quantity; they trained very elite naval aviators, for example, but very few of them. They also emphasized night fighting, the use of torpedoes, and an offensive spirit that was reckless and dashing, all to overcome numerical weakness that was inevitable given the two countries\\' industrial bases. At the start of the war, the Japanese arguably had the finest air fleet in the world, absolutely had the largest battleships, and had unparalleled torpedo technology. In the immediate run-up to WWII, the Japanese naval leadership conceived the plan of striking the Pacific fleet in Pearl Harbor at the same time as planned strikes on US, Dutch and British possessions in the Philippines and elsewhere. The Pearl Harbor attack was inspired partly by the British raid on Taranto, and was designed to cripple the U.S. fleet in harbor to win the Japanese extra time to build that defensive perimeter. To say that the political leadership underestimated America\\'s resolve for a long war is an understatement. For some reading regarding Japanese prewar plans, Peattie and Evans, Kaigun: Strategy, Tactics, and Technology in the Imperial Japanese Navy, 1887-1941 is the gold standard. It covers both operational and strategic developments in the building of the navy, and how those influenced one another. It is weak on airpower, because the two realized they were writing a long book already, but Peattie used much of their research to write the companion volume Sunburst: The Rise of Japanese Naval Air Power, 1909-1941 (Evans has passed away). For some reading about Midway, the current best book out there is Parshall and Tully, Shattered Sword: The Untold Story of the Battle of Midway. It\\'s The first history of Midway that draws heavily upon Japanese primary sources and dives into Japanese doctrine and tactics. Does an especially good job of telling the story from the Japanese perspective while rebutting or refuting many of the tropes about the battle and the \"failings\" that armchair admirals like to point out.',\n",
       " '/u/thefourthmaninaboat has given an excellent post about the legacy of World War I naval combat, as well as the tactical and operational considerations faced by the Japanese, British, and Americans in the Far East and Pacific, and /u/jschooltiger has also provided excellent commentary on the doctrine of the IJN itself. I want to try and expand on their answers by focusing on the internal politics of Japan at the time, and why that generated domestic pressures for a large and powerful battlefleet. In the early years of Imperial Japanese history, not long after the Meiji Restoration had concluded, when the new imperial government was attempting to identify what its defense priorities would be. In naval terms, this presented a question of how the navy would be developed. As a relatively minor power at the time, with a relatively limited economic base, the Japanese were initially highly interested in the French Jeune École concept, which held for a fleet of small commerce raiders and torpedo boats to provide a relatively cheap threat against a more dominant naval power. Given their standing in the late-19th century, the Japanese enthusiastically adopted this concept, and much of the IJN\\'s early fleet consisted of relatively small cruiser sized vessels. The First Sino-Japanese War called this into question, as while the better trained and organised IJN was able to defeat the Qing Empire\\'s Beiyang Fleet, the IJN struggled to deal appreciable damage to large Chinese battleships. The lessons learned in the First Sino-Japanese War would go on to play a major role in the build up to the Russo-Japanese War, as the IJN sought to acquire its own battleship force, which ultimately culminated in the Battle of Tsushima. While the tactical and strategic influence of Tsushima is significant (and the posts by the others have done much to expand on that point), the domestic political repercussions for Japan were also significant. It is at this point that Japanese internal politics begin to exercises a very large influence on the course of IJN naval planning. With the defeat of China and Russia, the two most clear rivals to Japan in the Far East, the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy faced a crucial question: who would Japan\\'s next rival be? This is where the infamous inter-service rivalry between the IJA and the IJN came to the forefront, as the Japanese were never able to properly answer that question. The IJA presumed that Japan\\'s greatest concern should remain Russia (later the Soviet Union), where a revanchist movement could threaten Japan\\'s holdings on continental mainland Asia. As a primarily continental threat, having Russia as the imagined future enemy would of course provide the the Army with primacy between the two branches, entitling it to a larger share of Japan\\'s quite limited resources. The Navy, seeking to justify its own continued existence, as well as desiring a larger slice of the resource pie, would go on to begin defining itself against the US, and using US naval strength as a justification for its own expansion. It\\'s important to note that at this point (the first decades of the 20th century), while there were undoubtedly a degree of tensions between the US and Japan, they were nothing like the tensions that would grow as a result of Japanese expansionism in the 1930s. The Navy\\'s choice of the US as its primary imagined threat was almost entirely a position taken for greater advantage in the internal struggle against the Japanese Navy\\'s true enemy: the Japanese Army. If the US was the primary threat, then, of course, the Navy would take primacy and the lion\\'s share of Japan\\'s resources. This kind of internal politicking to justify its own existence, and a larger share of Japan\\'s total resources was a major cause for the oft cited ratios of strength related to American naval strength, as the USN provided a useful justification for the IJN to continue to argue for its own further expansion. As we move into the 30s, and Japanese expansionism in Asia (especially in China) is further straining US-Japanese relations, this internal squabbling over resource allocations remained paramount. As the attention of both the Army and Navy turned to the south, the Navy found itself in a very awkward position. On the one hand, it had spent the past few decades demanding a large share of Japan\\'s national resources for itself, using the strength of the US Navy as a justification for its own continued expansion. On the other hand, despite all of this buildup, the Navy was still rather unsure of its own ability to defeat the Americans, leaving the IJN in the uncomfortable position of using the threat of war with the West to demand more resources, while also pushing back on actually going to war, for fear that it would be incapable of defeating the USN. To admit to incapability would be to admit that all the resources invested in the Navy were worthless, which was a humiliation the IJN simply couldn\\'t endure. You are also quite right in identifying that the Japanese could not fight another kind of war. No one in Japanese government or either branch of the military envisioned that Japan could win a long, drawn out war with the West. The differences in industrial power were simply too vast. Japan\\'s only real hope of victory was that they could win a series of early victories, defeat the initial naval counter attacks, and the negotiate peace from a position of strength. As such, the IJN invested very heavily in the kind of front loaded force that would enable it to have a chance at winning that kind of campaign, at the expense of almost everything it would need to support itself in a long, drawn out war. That the Japanese had no way of compelling the US or UK to negotiate such a treaty, and should have conducted diplomacy so as to avoid such a confrontation was a failing in Japanese politics that deserves in its own post. On a slightly different note, I would like to address the issue of \"obsolete\" battleships. While, in hindsight, it does seem like battleships were wastes of resources (and indeed, the IJN did husband its core battleship strength awaiting the Decisive Battle that never came), from the perspective of a naval designer or war planner in the 1930s, this was far from clear. Given the role air power would play in World War II, and the continuing dominance of air power in later 20th and 21st century wars, we have a tendency to lionise those early air power advocates of the 1920s who declared that air power had completely overcome traditional armies and navies, and--in naval terms--to imagine stodgy old \"battleship\" admirals, stuck in their ways, and unable to grasp the prominence of aircraft and carriers. However, we do tend to forget that the world proposed by the most zealous of air power advocates never came to fruition. Strategic bombing was unable to decide the war on its own accord, and land based high level bombers proved startlingly incapable of defeating naval formations (the US Army for one, envisioned the B-17 as a devastating anti-shipping weapon, a task it failed miserably at). In the 1920s and 30s, the carrier and aircraft in general were still an unproven weapon, and--given the relatively weak performance characteristics of aircraft of this era--that the various navies of the world continued to build and place confidence in their battleships was entirely sensible. Remember that up until the end of 1941, when Japanese bombers sank HMS Prince of Wales and Repulse off Malaya, no capital ship underway on the high seas had been sunk by aircraft. While British aircraft had indeed played a major role in the sinking of the Bismarck, as well as inflicting serious damage on Italian capital ships in the Mediterranean, such actions were still ultimately either against ships in harbor (as at Taranto) or as an adjunct to surface naval action (as with the Bismarck and the damaging of Vittorio Veneto at the Battle of Cape Matapan). This is not to say that aircraft were ignored either. Navies spent a great deal of effort envisioning the role aircraft and carriers would play in any coming war, but they were not yet seen as decisive in their own right. The Japanese in particular envisioned quite a major role for both their carrier and land based naval aircraft. However, until the lessons of World War II had been learned, it would have been a huge gamble to abandon battleships in favor of a new and untested weapons system.',\n",
       " 'Just to add my two cents: 1. As you mentioned in your own original question: there was evidence SUGGESTING that fleet-to-fleet battle doctrine WAS ineffectual. But it was still a hypothetical issue. During the 20s and 30s nobody was totally sure it was really the case. 2. But all that was just theoretical discussion and what if. What the Japanese already KNEW was that the fleet-to-fleet doctrine worked wonderfully for them before. When trying to understand the IJN\\'s mentality you can\\'t disregard the heavy legacy of Tsushima. Why on earth are you going to change your proven and successful doctrine to pursuit some fancy novelty? 3) Japan WAS NOT ALONE in this regard. England, US, France, Italy, even Germany were building battleship practically up to the very beginning of WWII. All the big fleets were still going with the \"Gun Club\" line and therefore it made sense for a naval power to stick to what was apparently the common sense. 4) Last but not least. A serious case can be made that actually Japan WAS RIGHT on keeping the fleet-to-fleet doctrine and the \"big battle\" strategy, because without Pearl Harbor a USN-IJN naval war would have very probably come to a massive \"Fleet-to-Fleet\" decisive action. Pearl Harbor changed everything. Without operational battleships in the Pacific Theater the USN had no other option than to rely on carriers and light units to fight the war. Doctrinal change came to the USN out of necessity not so much out of conviction. Without Pearl Harbor, the USN battleships sail to help the Philippines, Singapore or the Dutch East Indies and we have a huge “Fleet-to-Fleet” action in the middle of the Pacific sometime during the first months of 1942. So you could say that Japan actually lost the war in Pearl Harbor.',\n",
       " 'Why was this strategy chosen by the Japanese and enormous amounts of resources continued to be committed to the line battleships and heavy carriers? The battleship program was, in hindsight, a really poor use of resources for a country that was dependent on imported oil and materials to make steel, and more importantly, had relatively little industry for refining oil or making steel. It is important to keep in mind that, when these battleships were conceived in the mid-1930s, carriers were still unproven as the planes of the day weren\\'t really capable of bringing a lot of firepower to bear on opposing ships. Even in 1941, the best carrier launched torpedo bombers the US had featured a 400 mile range when carrying the torpedo, were only capable of launching torpedos at speeds under 115 mph, which really wasn\\'t an issue since the aircraft struggled to maintain a cruising speed much higher than that when carrying them. Long range bombers weren\\'t really a threat as they also had limited range and payloads and high altitude bombing sucked. Additionally, planners did not know that the Japanese did not know exactly what sort of oil crises they would face when the war finally broke out. So, I\\'ve been reading about the Japanese preparations for Pearl-Harbour and their strategical plans for the coming war and I\\'ve found out that they were planning to have two separate main line battles against the British and the Americans in order to secure the Pacific. Since I am not really familiar with the naval military history, this approach struck me as anachronistic and outdated by the experiences of the WWI and the technological developments in the Interbellum. And retrospectively we can say that this strategy indeed was wrong, since the Japanese were never able to secure the Pacific despite the initial advantage in line battleships and heavy aircraft carriers. As explained by /u/thefourthmaninaboat, an in-depth study of the Japanese government and Japanese politics prior to the war is needed to really understand the strategy which basically boiled down to: 1. Japan needed resources to survive; 2. Japan had to import most of its resources, including critical things such as food, oil, rubber, and steel; 3. Japan\\'s war in China was using a tremendous amount of resources; 4. Japan\\'s war in China was causing political issues which made it harder, and eventually impossible to import resources on any scale; 5. Japan knew it could run amok in the Pacific for 3-9 months before the Brits, Dutch, or US could really respond; 6. Japan did not think that any of those countries would have the stomach to try and recapture lost Pacific territories because it is really hard to perform amphibious invasions of remote islands. 7. Japan knew it would not be able to compete with the US or the Brits in a ship and airplane building contest. 8. Japan knew that the British were going to be tied up with Germany for the foreseeable future. Those are all pretty logical thoughts, except for #6. The irony with #6 is that the Brits and Dutch were collectively too weak to beat Japan in the early to mid-1940s. The Japanese political structure in the 1930s and 1940s was, highly summarized, a huge mess. It basically gave the Japanese Army and Navy the ability to set foreign policy independent of the government, a feature the Army was really fond of. The Army got the Japanese into the great resource suck of war in China, without any authorization from the government. The government went along because it seemed better than saying \"yo, sorry, we can\\'t really control the Army.\" If you like alternate history, I can see a fair number of scenarios where the Japanese simply capture the DEI and Singapore, avoid attacking the US, and are able to either avoid conflict with the US or are able to come to a quick treaty with the US after a few skirmishes. In those scenarios, the Japanese get 4-6 years to reinforce their holdings before the Brits and Dutch can get enough of a fleet and soldiers into staging areas in Australia to attempt to reconquer them. Japan would get even more time if the British rescue fleets defeated on their way to the theater. That entire time period would feature the Japanese building new fleets, planes, and defenses. If you think the Kido Butai was formidable - and it was the best carrier fleet in the world until 1943 - Japan might have been able to build 2 more of those combined fleets by 1945 if they\\'d had access to the materials necessary to do so and the time to train the crews and pilots. So where did Japan go wrong? IMO, the biggest problem was attacking the United States. Japan\\'s only reasonable hope to win the war in the Pacific was to quickly push the British and Dutch aside, get those colonies producing resources, and get those resources back to Japan, without starting a full scale war with the United States. The US public at the time was very isolationist and, IMO, there was a better than even chance the US would only respond economically if not attacked. The decision to attack Japan was simply a miscalculation by Japan. Sources: Shattered Sword by Parshall Japanese Destroyer Captain by Hara',\n",
       " \"I wrote a reply on this a few months ago that may help to address some of your questions. Take a look and I hope you'll come back if you have follow up questions or disagreements! Here's the key part of the top-level reply: No, they were just never very popular. Hexameter wasn't a very prestigious genre of poetry until the late 500s BCE: if you think of poets who were invited to take up residence at a tyrant's court, they're always choral, melic, and elegiac poets, never epic poets. Homer's name was known prior to the late 500s, but the main bit of testimony we have prior to that date links him to the Thebaid, not to the surviving epics. The popularity of the surviving epics doesn't seem to have taken off until the late 500s, perhaps as late as the 520s. They got lucky. The other epics ... just never got lucky. A metric for the change in the Iliad's popularity in the 500s is the prevalence of scenes in vase paintings. Vase painters weren't menial illustrators, and they had their own stories, but their choice of scenes is still telling: prior to the mid-500s, scenes from all over the Trojan War appear in vase paintings. But from around the 540s onwards, scenes related to episodes in the Iliad suddenly shoot to prominence and account for over half of all Trojan War scenes. That strongly suggests that prior to that point, either (a) epic poetry wasn't an especially dominant medium for these stories, or (b) all the epics were equally popular. And then the Iliad suddenly swamped popular consciousness. It got lucky. Maybe it was a lot better than the other epics, and that helped: that's what Aristotle's claims. But Aristotle certainly isn't infallible, and we'll never know for sure. Anyway, if that sudden rise to fame hadn't happened, the Iliad and Odyssey would certainly have gone the same way as the other epics. We can count on one hand the number of extant ancient writers who claim to have read any of the lost epics: Herodotus and Aristotle in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE, and Pausanias in the 2nd century CE -- and some scholars don't even believe Pausanias. And Pausanias only claims to have read two of the lost epics, the Cypria and the Little Iliad. Available evidence tends to suggest that, apart from the exceptional role of the Iliad and Odyssey from the 520s onwards, people didn't get their knowledge of the Trojan War from epic poems. By the Hellenistic period, they were getting their info from from prose accounts. You're probably aware that we have prose summaries of the lost Trojan epics: that seems to be what this material looked like. The prose summaries, and the account in the Library of pseudo-Apollodorus (one of our main sources for Greek myth), are based on the lost epics: well, the evidence points to people reading these prose versions and not reading the epics. When poets like Vergil and Ovid alluded to cyclic episodes, there's no particular likelihood that they knew the poems directly: they were very probably working from prose summaries, like the ones that we still have today.\",\n",
       " \"A relatively easy answer to this is that the Soviet Union wanted to look on the up-and-up when it came to its handling of Poland at the end of the war / post war. Poland was the entire reason WWII was started in Europe. The Soviets invaded Poland two weeks after the Germans did, and they annexed and and seceded Eastern and Southern Portions of Poland to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (such as Lvov / Lviv) and the Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. After Poland was liberated in 1944/1945, the Soviet Union never gave back the Polish territories they had annexed and incorporated at the beginning of the war. The Western Allies had a vested interest in the fait of Poland, but an even stronger interest in maintaining peaceful diplomacy with the Soviet Union, so as not to start World War III right on the heals of WWII. Poland would fall in to the Soviet sphere of influence, as would the newly reformed Czechoslovakia. Their doctrines would be Communist (even though the Armia Krajowa Home Army was the largest non-Communist Resistance Movement during the War, and most Poles did not want a Communist / puppet Soviet rule). But since the Soviet Union had taken Polish territory and diminished its pre-War size, and since Germany had large tracts of land that were historically Polish, and expanded upon during the War (Silesia, Pomerania, the Danzig Area, parts of East Prussia etc...) the USSR felt the best way to appease the Western Allies (and the Poles, especially located in areas that were now part of the USSR) was to strip Germany of essentially all of East Prussia (with the USSR taking the Konigsberg capital region and making it a little Russian inland island in the Baltic states), Silesia, Pomerania and the Danzig / Vistula mouth area and give it to the Poles. The main German border was pushed westward to the River Oder. Poland's borders were thus shifted Westward to incorporate these new Polish territories to make up for the regions they had lost in 1939 to the USSR. The ethnically Polish minorities still left in those areas, especially say Silesia, were given control. The Soviets resettled Poles from the former eastern parts of Poland (such as Lvov / Lviv) in the newly acquired territory (so ironically, Western Poland was no ethnically largely made up of pre-war Eastern Poles). The German civilians and former military personnel still in those areas, even in large cities like Breslau, were forcibly deported in the Fall of 1945 through Summer of 1946, with the winter of 45/46 being especially hellish. The vast majority were loaded in to cattle cars by Soviet occupation authorities and shipped Westward / North West in to East Germany. Some lucky ones managed to make it to West Germany though. But most were resettled in the DDR. The Poles in such places treated the ethnic Germans horribly, as a kind of retribution for their treatment by the Nazis (and most likely by the Soviets) during the War, and it was in fact the Soviet occupation forces that had to kind of keep some order and discipline in the years after the war. Battleground Prussia, Savage Continent, Fortress Breslau, and even A Higher Call (book about an American and German airmens heroic encounter, with the German being from Breslau and living there after the war for a time) provided much of my knowledge on this subject. Also to TL;DR my response, the USSR stole Polish territory, it wanted to look good in the eyes of the world, so gave Poland German territory to make up for it. The USSR did not take Czech territory.\",\n",
       " 'So take half the things you think you know about pirates from the Golden Age of Piracy (broadly 1650-1730\\'s, but peaked from 1715 to 1730) and toss it into the closet behind your Halloween pirate costume because it\\'s probably wrong. Much of what we imagine pirates to be like actually comes from fiction, specifically Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson, a man who never, ever met a pirate because he published it in 1883. Okay, maybe he met a shady sailor or two, but he got most of his stuff from previous adventure novelists or pirate history books which were often embellished such as A General History of Pyrates by Daniel DeFoe (no relation). &#x200B; So, first off, get rid of the idea that pirates sang \"sea shanties\". As noted in this excellent answer by u/DBGB, the sea shanty as we know them such as that ear worm \"Wellerman\" (please God, get it out of my head) were largely a 19th century creation. Now, were there work songs? Sure, but they were probably more basic rhythm songs to keep the sailors in sync when hauling rope and such. As far as the drinking and carrousing, pirates from this era were overwhelmingly working men who had moved to the coastal cities to find work, so you would find them singing songs found all over their respective nations, be them work songs or pub songs. &#x200B; Did pirates drink? Of course they did. Of course rum by this period was common, but they didn\\'t always drink it straight. Rum punch, a mixture of lime juice, rum, and sugar was common. Other punches could include exotic spices such as cinnamon, clove, other fruit and fruit juices, egg yolks, milk or cream. Sometimes they would swap out rum for wine and make sangria. Of course wine was also hugely popular, Madeira and a type called sack which was a fortified wine that travelled well were the most common. Beer was also common and mixed to create a drink called Flip, and another type of brew called Black Strap which mixed beer. Now on land, drink up me hearties, but at sea, drinking was often restricted. Drunk sailors are bad sailors. Bartholomew Roberts in his \"Pirate Code\" restricted drinking till after dark and to the open deck. In the articles of Edward Low and George Lowther being drunk at the time of engagement was a punishable offense, so no drinking on duty. John Gow only allowed half of the crew to drink at a time. Did this mean that pirates were teetotalers at sea? Nope. Often they were completely sloshed in combat which as noted, lead to being bad at being a pirate. So yep, they drank. Also fun to note, some pirate ships payed extra to skilled musicians to keep folks entertained and gave them extra privileges. &#x200B; As for gold? Yes, of course they took gold. They took gold, more often silver (since most national currencies and especially the Spanish were made from silver), pearls, and precious jewels. However, the most common loot was trade goods such as fabrics, tobacco, sugar, tools, livestock, etc. Ship repairing tools were often at a premium so saws, axes, and lathes were a big get. Pirates often would loot people too. If they needed a carpenter or a cooper (a man who makes barrels, not bird coops) they would impress them into service. Doctors tools and medicines were also a big catch since sailors were often injured not just from combat, but the dangerous work of a ship, and well, since we know they drank, they also slept around and venereal disease was common. One thing you might not expect to be a highly prized loot were maps. No, not treasure maps, but charts of islands and coasts that showed where the shallows and reefs were, inlets they could hide in, etc. As far as treasure maps? Nope. No evidence of treasure maps being a thing pirates did. Perhaps as lone sailors who buried loot after they got back to shore, but never on some deserted island. Pirates were in it for the money, and money buried under a palm tree on some island was money that wasn\\'t getting you prostitutes or booze. &#x200B; Now, we come to something I also want to talk about. You have to understand, and please understand this; pirates were not noble examples of proto-Marxists or Anarchists who supported their fellow brethren of the sea with equal work, equal pay, and a sense of roguish honor. Pirates were criminals. Murderers, thieves, rapists, and slavers, the lot of them. Pirates at sea had to set codes on their ships to ban gambling often because gambling caused fights. Pirates had to have rules about theft because they would steal from each other. Pirates had codes about dueling because they often hated each other. Pirates would often loot each others ships if the pickings were scarce. Blackbeard before he met his fate took most of the loot and his most loyal men and ran off leaving the rest broke and stranded for the English pirate hunters. Pirates tortured prisoners to give up loot or for information. One particularly gruesome one was tying them to the mast, tying a rope or leather strap around their head, and tightening it with a stick till their eyes popped out. As far as they were concerned about African slaves, they would gladly sell them in port for a profit, or if they couldn\\'t feed them, toss them overboard. Yes, there were some black pirates, but often pirates treated slaves just like other whites would; as property. &#x200B; -The Golden Age of Piracy: The Truth Behind Pirate Myths: Benerson Little -The Sea Rover\\'s Practice: Pirate TActics and Techniques:1630-1730: Benerson Little',\n",
       " \"Anosmia or loss of smell is not that uncommon condition, as modern research suggests that it is diagnosed in 2-4% of the adult population in USA and Western Europe and is likely to show similar occurrence in other regions, so it isn't that rare for people to just develop such condition due to various factors. The most common cause of anosmia is a viral infection of the upper airways that may result in the chemesthesic alterations (changes in the sensitivity of mucosa and skin to various chemicals), what might take form of decreased sensitivity of smell (although heightened or altered sense is also a possibility). This is quite closely associated with acute conditions caused by rhinoviruses and coronaviruses, with the present SARS-CoV-2 pandemic being possibly the best known example. It is also worth noting that the permanent complication might not be related to a severity of the illness, making it harder to pinpoint the actual case by the affected. In addition, various conditions related to the same area, such as e.g. sinusitis might result in a loss of smell. Aforementioned conditions are very common and travel to a distant area (such as another continent) might increase a chance of exposure to a strain one is not immune to. There is a possibility of developing the latter due to other conditions, especially neurodegenerative ones, such as Parkinson's Disease, Alzeimer's Disease or multiple screrosis, but I assume we can exclude these considerations in this particular case. Loss of smell can be also a result of a physical injury to the facial region or serious concussion. Such cases are rare, but not unheard of. We can't of course, exclude actual damage of the olfactory field or pathways due to toxic chemical agents that might not need to be associated with chemical warfare. Compounds created during the combustion of the explosives and propellants are not necessarily healthy, and although they are readily dispersed in an open space, it is possible that they might have an adverse influence when the exposure is high enough (in case of e.g. machine gunners, especially those operating in confined spaces, such as bunkers or airplanes - Bohdan Arct, WW2 airman, recalls in his memoirs a nose gunner who started to become sick during the missions and only after some time he noticed that the hose in his oxygen mask was damaged, causing his to inhale the fumes). This also applies to various volatile compounds contained in chemicals, such as liquid fuel, paints, solvents etc. Between the relatively lax approach to safety in the 1940s (at least when compared to modern regulations by OSHA and equivalent institutions) and deliberate or incidental lowering of safety standards due to frontline conditions, such exposure to harmful substances might have been a factor. Daytime North African conditions, with its notoriously high air temperatures and airborne fine sand could have also exacerbated the latter problem. Last but not least, soldiers were not unlikely to inhale various toxic substances in the combat zone, chiefly caused by various forms of fire. In addition, white phosphorous, commonly used used in smoke rounds during Second World War and the following decades, creates e.g. phosphorous pentoxide, a very powerful irritant that can potentially cause damage to nasal mucosa and associated complications. In case of gas mask malfunction or prolonged exposure to the compound even in small concentration (present even after the smoke visibly disperses and soldiers are likely to take masks off) can also eventually lead to the damage of the sense of smell. So, to sum it up, loss of smell is uncommon, but not that rare condition and given the circumstances, it could have been caused by an illness, injury, a exposure to various common chemicals (let's assume that smoke screen is common in a military setting) or a combination thereof.\",\n",
       " 'The topic of the Indian ideal & idea of King is very interesting, to say the least. And fortunately for us, unlike other topics of Indian history where records are scant, we have plenty of material in the form of political treatise, religious epics, & literary works to form a basic idea of what ancient Indians thought about the status of kings in the society. So let us begin to see how the idea developed & what implications it had on the society. So to answer your question we would look directly at the ancient Indian sources to see what they think of the subject Origins Traditionally it is held that earlier humanity was without a ruler & society worked on the principles of MatasyaNyaya (law of the fish) where the strong would bully the weak. Tired of this anarchy people went to Brahma the creator God who appointed Manu as the first ruler among men. People agreed that they would give him 1/6 of all grain & 1/10 of other material earnings & in return he would establish laws & make sure that justice prevails. This account of origins of monarchy is attested by various Indian political tretises such as Manusmriti, Arthashastra, Shukraneeti, & Vidurneeti. We would discuss it\\'s implications later, but first we also need to see at another account detailing the origins of the word Raja which is the most common title for a royal in India. In old times lived the king Prithu (who among other things, is credited with introducing agriculture to humanity) who established justice in all his domains. Thus being very pleasant to his subjects (the Sanskrit word used here is the root verb रंज (ranja) which means pleasing) people started calling him Raja. (Mahabharat - Shantiparva) What the legends of Manu & Prithu as detailed in the ancient works reveal to us is the belief that a King had divine origins he was not divine himself. In Manu\\'s case the kingship is granted to Manu because the people demand it & the rate of taxation is fixed after the agreement of the people. And the legend of Prithu informs the King that his job description is to please his subjects. This though appointed to his place by Divine favor he still needs the approval of the people. This approval, according to the thinkers, is gained by ensuring people\\'s happiness which in the words of Kautilya\\'s Artshashastra is gained by following Dharma & ensuring material prosperity to subjects (Sukhasya mulam Dharma; Dharmasya mulam Artha = Dharma is the source of happiness, Money is the source of Dharma) The status of the King As we have seen, though the king has divine origins, he is not divine. Manusmriti in this regard clarifies that the King is only metaphorically divine & the real divinity lies with Dharma (law). So a king in sacred as long he is just & follows the law. If he becomes wicked & ceases to follow the law, he is no longer sancrosanct & the people no longer need to obey him. This symbolism is further stressed out in the Hindu ritual coronation ceremony as laid out in Samskar Vidhi where before the coronation the Royal priests & the elders tell the king that he has to rule over everyone & when the coronation is complete they have to tell him that Dharma will rule over him. Even Kautilya\\'s Arthashastra which is most ruthless in it\\'s advice (earning Kautilya comparisons to Machiavelli) advises the King to be kind to his subjects because a wicked king is overthrown. Even in case of rebellions, the King should introspect & correct any faults that may have caused it. In fact the status of king w.r.to Dharma could be assessed by the source of this Dharma which are listed in order of importance 1) Dharmashastra - the sacred texts 2) Charita - the examples set by great personlities of histories & myths 3) Vyavhara - the traditions & cuatoms handed down over generations 4) Rajashasana - the orders & edicts of the king & his predecessors So the even in case of law, the word of the King has the least authority. The Birthright & Rebellion All of the ancient Indian thinkers agree that the King should\\'ve a noble heritage (royal bloodline is preferable). But then again, that is just one of the many requirements in a King. In fact Arthashastra & Shukraneeti both go on to argue that if those of royal bloodline are incapable or \"wicked\" the King should disinherit all of them & adopt somebody of good character to inherit the throne. (There are cases of a few women succeeding the throne, such as Rudramma Devi of the Kakatiya dynasty, despite the presence of male contenders). Thus even the birth-right isn\\'t sacrosanct. In cases, where an usurper lacked the required nobility, religious ceremonies such as the Hiranyagarbha were used to provide the necessary nobility to the King. Thus even a non-noble usurper, if successful, could gain nobility & secure his hold over the throne. And this lead us to rebellion & coups in the state. A lack of a divine mandate or sanctity of birthright means that it is very easy to overthrow a king. The rebel just has to claim that the King is \"wicked\" & \"incompetent\" to justify his pretensions. He doesn\\'t risks any divine wrath or religious scrutiny by doing so. In fact unlike other societies, rebels aren\\'t scorned or shunned but in many cases celebrated. An example of this could be found in Sudraka\\'s 5th century play Mrcchakatika where the central characters play an important role in overthrow of the evil king Palaka of Ujjaiyini The Divine favor Although the King was to rule with the will of people, divine favor was still sought to cement the status & hold over power. But this divine favour was to be earned & wasn\\'t something that passed generation to generation. So while the Rashtrakuta ruler Amoghavarsha claimed that his domain was free of famine due to the favour of Goddess Mahalaxmi this favor had came at a high price, as Amoghavrsha is said to have sacrificed one of his fingers to the deity. Similarly Mihirbhoja of the Parmara dynasty \"vanquished his enemies with blessings of Vishnu\" but these blessings were provided because he was Adivarah or the foremost in devotion to Vishnu. This also led to a situation where the Kings could deviate from the established practice & were free to switch between sects & religions multiple times during their lifetime. (The aforementioned Amoghavarsha started as a Hindu devotee of Mahalaxmi & switched to Jainism & still patronised Hinduism, Jainism & Buddhism equally. tl:dr; 1) The King has divine origins but is not divine himself 2) The King is an autocrat ruling over everyone in his domain, but still bound by law & could be overthrown if he refuses to follow it 3) The King essentially rules by the will of his subjects. If they aren\\'t happy his days are numbered 4) Birthright is a very necessary requirement to claim the crown but a lack of it wouldn\\'t necessarily hinder somebody 5) The King needs divine favor but it is to be earned & he couldn\\'t just claim it through descent or virtue of his status',\n",
       " 'The Name of the Rose is set in Piedmont in 1327. That land, south of the Alps, is the gateway between the Languedoc and Italy, an important route for merchants, pilgrims and ideas. Not far north of that route is Lyons where, in the later 12th century, Valdes, a wealthy merchant, gave up all his worldly possessions to pursue a life of poverty and preaching. To live life as the apostles had: Apostolica Vita. Soon, Valdes had many followers in Lyons, and The Poor Men of Lyons, or the Waldensians, were born. If we jump forward in time, to the late 13th/early 14th centuries, to the primary heresy discussed in The Name of the Rose, the Dulcinians, we can also locate a founding figure, or rather, founding figures: Gerard Segerelli, followed by Fra Dulcino, and both were inspired by the apocalyptic teachings of Joachim of Fiore a century earlier. We do not know with certainty the \"class\" backgrounds of Segerelli or Dulcino but tradition states that Segerelli was relatively low born, and Dulcino was relatively high born. Nevertheless, both were inspired by the teaching of St Francis, the son of a wealthy merchant, and eventually their methods of poverty were declared heretical. Ultimately, both of these groups should be considered as reformers. Both wanted elements of the Church to behave in a way that was more a kin to the teachings of Christ and the apostles in the New Testament. Valdes in the pre-friar era, and the Dulcinians in the post-friar era. From the perspective of the Church, the followers of these groups were rusticani, or Idiotae et Illiterati, it is possible that this refers to peasants, but it is more likely to mean ignorant of Latin and without formal training. However, it is evident from evidence regarding groups like the \"Cathars\" that support could be found amongst noblemen, and not just the peasantry. Moreover, as Valdes demonstrates some \"heretics\" would have been members of the \"emerging middle class\" and through guilt regarding their new wealth decided to lead a life of poverty. Eventually being considered heretical. It is important to note that a heresy, becomes a heresy because someone with the authority to label it a heresy labels it as such. These people didn\\'t set out to be heretics, they set out to be better Christians. It is easy to associate these groups, particularly with regards to their poverty, with the peasantry. However, a key component was the \"voluntary\" nature of their poverty. They had sacrificed something in becoming poor. St Francis of Assisi, the son of a wealthy merchant, gave up his fortune. There was something noble in that behaviour that people of the time, of all backgrounds, could get behind. So in answer to your question, I would argue the heretical groups of this time were composed of too many different people, with too many different backgrounds for them to be labelled as \"peasant rebellions\". Former members of the clergy, noblemen and women, wealthy merchants, artisans, weavers, farmers, and importantly women (some of these groups gave them permission to preach), all played their roles in these movements. Whilst not peasant rebellions as such, they were theological reformers and, once condemned as heretics, if they continued to preach and teach their beliefs, they would become rebels.',\n",
       " 'It seems you are asking about the background and reasons of anti-Jewish and/or anti-Semitic sentiment throughout history. Posts of this type are common on the subreddit, so we have this reply which is intended as a general response that provides an overview of the history of anti-Semitic thought and action. The essential point that needs to be emphasized: the reason for anti-Jewish hatred and persecution has absolutely nothing to do with things Jewish men and women did, said or thought. Religious and racial persecution is not the fault of the victim but of the persecutor and anti-Semitism, like all prejudices, is inherently irrational. Framing history in a manner that places the reason for racial hatred with its victims is a technique frequently employed by racists to justify their hateful ideology. The reasons why Jews specifically were persecuted, expelled, and discriminated against throughout mainly European history can vary greatly depending on time and place, but there are overarching historical factors that can help us understand the historical persecution of Jews - mainly that they often were the only minority available to scapegoat. Christian majority societies as early as the Roman empire had an often strained and complicated relationship with the Jewish population that lived within their borders. Christian leaders instituted a policy that simultaneously included grudging permissions for Jews to live in certain areas and practice their faith under certain circumstances but at the same time subjected them to discriminatory measures such as restrictions where they could live and what professions they could practice. The Christian Churches – Catholic, Orthodox, and later Protestant – also begrudgingly viewed the Jews as the people of the Old Testament but used their dominant roles in society to make the Jewish population the target of intense proselytization and other them further by preaching their fault for the death of Jesus. This dynamic meant that Jews were the most easily recognisable and visible minority to point fingers at during a crisis. This can be best observed with the frequent accusations of \"blood libel\" – an anti-Semitic canard alleging that Jews murdered Christian children to use their blood in religious rituals – in situations where Christian children or adults disappeared, the communal panic immediately channeling itself as Jew-hatred with tragic results. Similarly, religious, ideological, and economic reasons were often interwoven in the expulsion of Jews to whom medieval rulers and kings owed a lot of money; in fact, one intersection of crisis-blaming and financial motive occurred during the Black Death, when local rulers were able to cynically blame Jews for the plague as an excuse for murdering and expelling them. These processes also often took place within negotiations between social and political elites over state formation. One of the best examples is the expulsion of the Jewish population from Spain by the rulers of Castile and Aragon after the Reconquista in 1491. Expulsion and forcible conversions progressed toward an institutionalized suspicion towards so-called New Christians – Jews who’d recently converted– based on their \"blood\". This was an unprecedented element in antisemitic attitudes that some scholars place within the context of Spanish rulers and nobility becoming engaged in a rather brutal state formation process. In order to define themselves, they chose to define and get rid of a group they painted as alien, foreign and different in a negative way – as the \"other\". Once again Jews were the easily available minority. Jews long remained in this position of only available religious minority, and over time they were often made very visible as such: discriminatory measures introduced very early on included being forced to wear certain hats and clothing, be part of humiliating rituals, pay onerous taxes, live in restricted areas of towns – ghettos – and be separated from the majority population. All this further increased the sense of “other-ness” that majority societies experienced toward the Jews. They were made into the other by such measures. This continued with the advent of modernity, especially in the context of nationalism. The 19th century is marked by a huge shift in ways to explain the world, especially in regards to factors such as nationalism, race, and science. To break it down to the essentials: the French Revolution and its aftermath delegitimized previously established explanations for why the world was the way it was – a new paradigm of “rationalism” took hold. People would now seek to explain differences in social organizations and ways of living between the various peoples of the world with this new paradigm. Out of this endeavour to explain why people were different soon emerged what we today understand as modern racism, meaning not just theories on why people are different but constructing a dichotomy of worth out of these differences. A shift took place from a religious othering to one based more on nationality - and thereby, in the minds of many, on race. In the tradition of völkisch thought, as formulated by thinkers such as Gobineau and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, races as the main historical actors were seen as acting through the nation. Nations were their tool or outlet to take part in Social Darwinist competition between the races. The Jews were seen as a race without a nation - as their own race, which dates back to them being imperial subjects and older stereotypes of them as \"the other\" - and therefore acting internationally rather than nationally. Seen through this nationalistic lens, an individual Jew living in Germany, for example, was not seen as German but was seen as having no nation. For such Jews, this meant that the Jewish emancipation that Enlightenment brought provided unprecedented freedom and removed many of the barriers that they had previously experienced, the advent of scientific racism and volkisch thought meant that new barriers and prejudices simply replaced them. Racist thinkers of the 19th century augmented these new barriers and prejudices with conspiratorial thinking. The best example for this anti-Semitic delusion are the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a fake political treatise produced by the Tsarist Secret Police at some point in 1904/05 which pretends to be the minutes of a meeting of the leaders of a Jewish world conspiracy discussing plans to get rid of all the world\\'s nations and take over the world. While the Protocols were quickly debunked as a forgery, they had a huge impact on many anti-Semitic and völkisch thinkers in Europe, including some whose writings were most likely read by the young Hitler. The whole trope of the Jewish conspiracy as formulated by völkisch thought took on a whole new importance in the late 1910s, with the end of WWI, the Bolshevik revolution, and subsequent attempts at communist revolution in Germany and elsewhere. Jews during the 19th century had often embraced ideologies such as (classical) liberalism and communism, because they hoped these ideologies would propagate a world in which it didn’t matter whether you were a Jew or not. However, the idea of Jews being a driving force behind communism was clearly designed by Tsarist secret police and various racists in the Russian Empire as a way to discredit communism as an ideology. This trope of Jews being the main instigators behind communism and Bolshevism subsequently spread from the remnants of Tsarist Russia over the central powers all the way to Western Europe. This delusion of an internationalist conspiracy would finally result in the Nazis’ Holocaust killing vast numbers of Jews and those made Jews by the Nazi’s racial laws. While this form of anti-Semitism lost some of its mass appeal in the years after 1945, forms of it still live on, mostly in the charge of conspiracy so central to the modern form of anti-Semitism: from instances such as the Moscow doctors’ trial, to prevalent discourses about Jews belonging to no nation, to discourses related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to the recent surges of anti-Semitic violence in various states – anti-Semitism didn’t disappear after the end of the Holocaust. Even the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the conspiratorial pamphlet debunked soon after it was written at the beginning of the 20th century, has been consistently in print throughout the world ever since. Again, anti-Jewish persecution has never been caused by something the Jews did, said, or thought. It was and is caused by the hatred, delusions, and irrational prejudices harbored by those who carried out said persecution. After centuries of standing out due to religious and alleged racial difference, without defenders and prevented from defending themselves, Jews stood out as almost an ideal “other.” Whether the immediate cause at various points has been religious difference, conspiracy theory, ancestral memory of hatred, or simply obvious difference, Jews were and continue to be targeted by those who adhere to ideologies of hatred.

       " 'I recently recommended this book in another thread, but it’s absolutely worth mentioning again: “Secondhand Time: The Last of the Soviets” by Svetlana Alexeivich is a fantastic book, the best I’ve read on the subject. I haven’t read Remnick’s “Ressurection,” but I can assume it’s similarly written to “Lenin’s Tomb” with a mixture of historical narrative and his personal experiences. Secondhand Time, on the other hand, is an oral history drawing from the voices of hundreds of people across the Soviet Union from the 1990s to their 2010s. These interviews, which range from short snippets collected on the street to chapter long accounts by one individual provide a really in depth look at the various issues concerning the Soviet people- what does it mean to be communist or capitalist? How does one reconcile the shameful and bloody past of the Stalinist era with the future? What does it mean to be Russian, or Latvian, or Moldovan now that the shared soviet identity has collapsed? In looking at these issues Alexeivich interviews people from all levels of Soviet society, from the elderly who lived through the revolution to the youth of the 90s, from humble workers to party big shots, from almost every member republic of the Union. Alexeivich is also great at keeping her voice out of it and letting the people speak for themselves. The end result is a rich, but also incredibly raw, often heart wrenching, book that dives deep into the soul and collective memory of the nation. Absolutely recommend, 10/10',\n",
       " 'Not by the name of Mamluk but by the name of Ghulam many Islamic states used them. Mamluk name was later emerged and took place of ghulam in Mamluk Empire. Ghulam system was invented by the Abbasid Caliph Al-Mutasim to make use of the horsemanship of Turkic nomads. Though before Abbasids in Umayyads there were such elements too. In the year 674 for example Basra governor/commander of Muaviye bin Ebu Sufyan, Ubeydullah bin Ziyad brought 2000 Turkic archers and put them in Basra. In fact many islamic states were founded by ghulams. Delhi Sultanate in India, Mamluk Sultanate, Ghaznavids, Khwarezmians, Tolounids of Egypt, Ikhshidites of Egypt. These states were founded by ghulams/mamluks and continued the practice. Apart from them Seljuks also used ghulams. Great Seljuk Empire would take the pagan Turkic people, convert them to islam and raise them as elite soldiers. But its offshot in Anatolia: Anatolian Seljuk Sultanates ghulams were mostly hellenized Anatolians or Armenians because there werent many pagan Turks so their pool was limited to Christians of Anatolia. After a certain point all Turkic people basically islamified and since it was a sin to enslave muslims in shariah law now Christians of Caucasus and Balkans were preferred. Thats how janissaries were born in Ottoman Empire. In Mamluk Empire in the first half Kipchak Turks were recruited but in the reign of Sultan Qalawun who himself was also a Kipchak, started recruiting Circassians to counterbalance Turkic Mamluks political power. North African kingdoms from what I know didnt have ghulams. Mongols or Mongol states in middle east didnt inherit ghulam system but Aq Koyunlus, a Turkmen state did have ghulams. Their successor Safavids also did. I didnt hear it for the Afsharids but Qajars also had ghulams. Safavids disnt have ghulams until Shah Abbas period but Shah Abbas was so sick of inner Turkmen clans political fights that he decided to form ghulams among Caucasian Christians again. Mainly Georgians.',\n",
       " 'The three \"kings\" mentioned in John Henry Hopkins\\' Christmas carol are a reference to a story mentioned in the New Testament in Matthew 2: Matthew 2:2 After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem and asked, “Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews?\" Matthew 2:11 On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. Note that it does not actually mention that there were three of them, or whether they actually were kings or not, nor where they came from nor their names. However, in the Old Testament there are various prophecies that the verse in Matthew seems to fulfill Isaiah 60:6: The multitude of camels shall cover your land, The dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; All those from Sheba shall come; They shall bring gold and incense, And they shall proclaim the praises of the Lord. Psalms 72:10 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles will bring presents; The kings of Sheba and Seba Will offer gifts. If the story in Matthew is a fulfilment of the prophecies in Isiah and Psalms then we can assume the Magi were in fact kings and came variously from Midian, Ephah, Sheba, \"Tarshish and the Isles\" and Seba, Three \"gifts\" suggests there were three of them. Note that the only source we have is the Bible itself (New King James Translation) and as far as I am aware there are no other sources that mention this event.

       " \"Short answer: they weren't found, they were kept all along -- or rather copied, by people who were on the whole as interested in them in the past as people are today. For the first part of your question, the best source of information for this kind of question is to check a recent critical edition. The 2015 edition by Nigel Wilson, for the Oxford Classical Texts series, states There are some sixty medieval and Renaissance manuscripts. None of them is earlier than the tenth century. and he goes on to describe the manuscripts, which are held in various collections in Europe, and which fall into two manuscript traditions: For one branch of the tradition, the main copy is an early 10th century manuscript held at the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana in Florence, Italy, catalogued as Plutei 70.3. For the other branch, several manuscripts are important: one in the Vatican Apostolic Library, Vaticanus graecus 2369 (10th century), and a group of four manuscripts which go back to a lost ancestor; the surviving four are held at the Vatican and the Österreichische Nationalbibliothek in Vienna. In total there are seven manuscripts that he draws on regularly for his edition, held in Florence, the Vatican, Cambridge, and Vienna. He cites a few others less frequently, some held in the same libraries, others in Nürnberg and Paris. Many manuscript collections have put a lot of work into digitising manuscripts, so some of these are available to look at online. The Laurentian manuscript, for example, is here Vat. gr. 2369 will probably become available online at some point (the Vatican has made more of its collection freely available than most libraries, but it costs a lot of money and it's a long process). Ancient books were transmitted by an ongoing tradition of copying and re-publishing books. In antiquity this was done by booksellers who got scribes to make new copies; there was a severe decline in book culture in the Greek-speaking parts of the Mediterranean between the 6th and 9th centuries, and when it revived starting in the mid-800s, it was thanks to a mix of secular and ecclesiastical scholarship. Book culture in Constantinople was more or less continuous from then until 1453. After that point, the text of Herodotus survived in copies that had mostly been previously transported to Italy, and disseminated from there. Manuscripts made in that era -- after the development of the printing press -- are often very important too. In the west, different manuscript collections had different levels of stability and permanence. For example, one collection now held at the Vatican, the Palatine collection, came from a collection that was captured in the Thirty Years War from the Electoral Palatinate in Heidelberg in the 1500s-1600s. This in turn had been swiped from the monastery of Lorsch when the monasteries were dissolved in the 1560s. And Lorsch in turn got its collection from a range of sources. I wrote a piece last year that gave a bit more context for the story of how Greek literature in general survived to the present day. There are many printed accounts out there too, though for my money they tend to underplay the importance of Greek scribes and scholars in the renaissance.\",\n",
       " 'As an anthropologist, Geertz was not writing for historians, nor was he, from my notice, familiar with historiography. Thus, we need to look to the older anthropological theories to understand where he\\'s coming from and why he\\'s important. In the mid 20th century, anthropology experienced its first true paradigms shifts. Sure, people had been writing about human societies for 100 years by then. But these were foundational scholars like Karl Marx or Emil Drukheim, whose work predated any divisions within the social sciences; physical \"anthrolopogists\" who only studied human morphology in vain attempts to delineate human races; and armchair \"ethnographers\" like Lewis Henry Morgan who were fascinated by indigenous American cultures and raced to preserve it (mostly ignoring, of course, the systems of oppression that threatened it). The modern field of socio-cultural anthropology had only emerged at the start of that century. Franz Boas started the first department in the US in 1903; it wasn\\'t until after 1937 that A.R. Radcliffe-Brown started the anthropology department at Oxford. Long term, in depth fieldwork as the primary method of the anthropologists only comes about in the 1920s, with significant publications from Bronislaw Malinowski, Margaret Mead, and others. A primary consequence of this was that the field was very small, and those involved were heavily influenced by single individuals. As famous as Boas is for basically starting American anthropology, his students (Mead, Edward Sapir, Ruth Benedict, etc.) can also be said to have started their own schools of thought. By the late \\'50s there\\'s finally enough anthropologists around that people start to A) branch into different schools within anthropology and B) revisit the founding concepts of the field. One of those concepts was the idea of \"culture.\" Up to that point, most anthropologists could be considered Functionalists: cultural practices exist to serve certain functions within a culture. People need to eat, they need to resolve conflicts, and they need to raise children; what we call \"culture\" is generally just means to those ends. At the same time, people knew culture was more than that- but what was it? Where is culture \"located:\" in the mind, in the social world, somewhere in between? How can we study it, since it\\'s lot more than the behaviors that we can observe? Some folks- the ethnoscientists- found value in identifying what they called the \"domains\" of a culture. By \"domains,\" they meant the categories with which a people viewed and understood their world: how are colors, animals, plants, foods, and geography classified? Similarly, cognitive anthropologists were interested in the psychological aspects of culture. Claude Levi-Strauss took this even further with his field of Structuralism; Levi-Strauss argued that human behaviors across cultures revealed underlying patterns/structures of human thought. Some went the opposite direction and revived Marxist, evolutionary, and other materialist perspectives from the 19th-century. These scholars saw culture as a byproduct, a consequence of basic needs. They focused on economies, subsistence strategies, and the development of sociopolitical complexity. The traditionally \"cultural\" things that anthropologists studied- ritual, dance, religion, dress- were often ignored or considered inconsequential. The real story of these people was underneath that, in their material lives. Others were influenced by linguistics and saw culture as a network of signs and meanings shared by a community. Whereas structuralists also used a linguistic analogy, they did so to emphasize the underlying rules (i.e. \"grammar\") of a cultural systems. These Symbolic Anthropologists- Mary Douglas, Victor Turner, and Clifford Geertz- instead found culture something to be \"read.\" Cultural behaviors were representative, they had deeper meanings, meanings that were sometimes spoken, sometimes unspoken and secret, and sometimes tacitly acknowledged. It was the anthropologists job to, as Iggers says, \"decipher these experiences indirectly though symbolic and ritualistic acts.\" The fundamental tool of the Symbolic Anthropologist, per Geertz, is Thick Description. \"Thick\" refers to the depth of the ethnographic narrative; it must analyze behaviors at multiple levels. Geertz gives the example of a wink in the introduction to The Interpretation of Cultures. A wink is a tremendously simple action, one that may even be done unconsciously. When it\\'s directed at someone, what does it mean? Perhaps it\\'s a simple wink of acknowledgement, an \"I see what you did there.\" Perhaps it\\'s a flirty wink at a girl at the bar. Perhaps it\\'s an ironically flirty wink. Perhaps it\\'s ironically flirty but still used to flirt. Perhaps it\\'s in reference to some piece of popular culture. The action is bound up in a \"web of significance.\" The recipient (presumably) understands what is meant. But can the anthropologist? To do so they must understand the interlinked system of meanings, aka \"culture.\" Thick Description is explaining behaviors within multiple layers of cultural meaning. This meant that Geertz and similar authors spent more time talking about culture in its own terms than did other anthropologists at the time. Cultures weren\\'t byproducts of material behaviors or psychological natures, but things inherently complex enough to study independently. As Iggers notes, this appealed to contemporary social historians, though they didn\\'t do much with it. His critiques of Geertz (\"the thick description they call for does not give us access to an individual but only to the culture in which he or she is bound up\") closely resembles those made by later anthropologists. Geertz\\' most famous essay, Notes on a Balinese Cockfight, is archetype of Tick Description; not only is it a vivid account of a distinctive tradition, but it is also an interpretation of what the event means for people. It\\'s a display of class, an arbitrer of personal conflicts, a contest of manliness (the obvious \"cock\" puns are plentiful). Yet through it all, it\\'s hard to apply to any specific historical moment. Geertz speaks only of \"the Balinese\" as a collective; the bound system of meaning that he thickly describes seems only to exist in his writings. Because thick description is so concerned with culture and culture alone, it has limited applications in historical, specific writing.',\n",
       " 'The first thing that should be understood is that depictions of Satan or the Devil, and understandings of who and what that name and figure personified and meant have varied considerably over time. So folks in medieval Europe would not have necessarily seen the devil as basically human with red skin, a bifurcated tail, little horns on his head, cloven hoofs instead of feet, a black goatee and mustache, and carrying a pitchfork - but neither would any of those individual attributes necessarily been out of place. One of the very general things that can be said about depictions of the devil in medieval art and literature is that they were generally eclectic, and not always immediately monstrous, at least in folkloric appearances. The idea of the \"Black Man\" as Satan, or vice versa, was something that gained popularity in the confessions of the European Witch Trials. Whether this was a reflection of genuine medieval folk beliefs or a construction of the inquisitors that massaged the stories to better conform to the form that they wanted to hear isn\\'t clear. You can see something of this in Margaret Murray\\'s The Witch-Cult in Western Europe (which should not be taken by itself as history, but it is sometimes convenient a gauge of popular understanding in the early 20th century): John Walsh of Dorsetshire, 1566, described the Devil, whom he called his Familiar, as \\'sometymes like a man in all proportions, sauing that he had clouen feete\\'. The Lancashire witch, Anne Chattox, 1613, said, \\'A thing like a Christian man did sundry times come to this Examinate, and requested this Examinate to giue him her Soule: And in the end, this Examinate was contented to giue him her sayd Soule, shee being then in her owne house, in the Forrest of Pendle; wherevpon the Deuill then in the shape of a Man, sayd to this Examinate: Thou shalt want nothing.\\' Elizabeth Southerns of the same Coven said that \\'there met her this Examinate a Spirit or Deuill, in the shape of a Boy, the one halfe of his Coate blacke, and the other browne\\'. To Margaret Johnson, one of the later Lancashire witches, 1633, there appeared \\'a spirit or divell in the similitude and proportion of a man, apparelled in a suite of black, tyed about wth silke pointes\\'. The Yarmouth witch, 1644, \\'when she was in Bed, heard one knock at her Door, and rising to her Window, she saw, it being Moonlight, a tall black Man there\\'. The Essex witches, 1645, agreed very fairly in their description of the man who came amongst them: according to Elizabeth Clarke he appeared \\'in the shape of a proper gentleman, with a laced band, having the whole proportion of a man.... He had oftentimes knocked at her dore in the night time; and shee did arise open the dore and let him in\\'; Rebecca Weste gave evidence that \\'the Devil appeared in the likeness of a proper young man\\'; and Rebecca Jones said that the Devil as \\'a very handsome young man came to the door, who asked how she did\\'; on another occasion she met the Devil, \\'as shee was going to St. Osyth to sell butter\\', in the form of a \\'man in a ragged sute\\'. There are two accounts of the evidence given by the Huntingdonshire witch, Joan Wallis of Keiston, 1646: Stearne says that she \\'confessed the Devill came to her in the likenesse of a man in blackish cloathing, but had cloven feet\\'. Davenport\\'s record is slightly different: \\'Blackman came first to her, about a twelve-moneth since, like a man something ancient, in blackish cloathes, but he had ugly feet uncovered.\\' The evidence of the Suffolk witches, 1645-6, is to the same effect; Thomazine Ratcliffe of Shellie confessed that \\'there came one in the likeness of a man.—One Richmond, a woman which lived at Brampford, confessed the Devill appeared to her in the likenesse of a man, called Daniel the Prophet.—One Bush of Barton, widdow, confessed that the Devill appeared to her in the shape of a young black man\\'. All the Covens of Somerset, 1664, were evidently under one Chief; he came to Elizabeth Style as \\'a handsome man\\'; to Elizabeth Style, Anne Bishop, Alice Duke, and Mary Penny as \\'a Man in black Clothes, with a little Band\\'; to Christian Green \\'in the shape of a Man in blackish Clothes\\'; and to Mary and Catherine Green as \\'a little Man in black Clothes with a little Band\\'. To the Yorkshire witch, Alice Huson, 1664, he appeared \\'like a Black Man on a Horse upon the Moor\\', and again \\'like a Black Man upon a Black Horse, with Cloven Feet\\'. Abre Grinset of Dunwich, in Suffolk, 1665, said \\'he did appear in the form of a Pretty handsom Young Man\\'. In Northumberland, 1673, Ann Armstrong said that \\'she see the said Ann Forster with twelve others and a long black man rideing on a bay galloway, as she thought, which they call\\'d there protector\\'. The Devonshire witch Susanna Edwards, 1682, enters into some detail: \\'She did meet with a gentleman in a field called the Parsonage Close in the town of Biddiford. And saith that his apparel was all of black. Upon which she did hope to have a piece of money of him. Whereupon the gentleman drawing near unto this examinant, she did make a curchy or courtesy unto him, as she did use to do to gentlemen. Being demanded what and who the gentleman she spake of was, the said examinant answered and said, That it was the Devil.\\' In Northamptonshire, 1705, he came to Mary Phillips and Elinor Shaw as \\'a tall black Man\\'. Murray was cherry-picking her sources, so don\\'t take this as an absolute census of accused witches in agreement as to what the devil looked like! But it does show that for folks that wanted to look through the trial records, there could be construed the idea that the devil came dressed in black, or was a \"black man\" - whether they mean that in the sense of an individual that was Ethiopian or Moorish in appearance or literally \"black\" as from coal isn\\'t clear...and that goes for more than Murray\\'s selection. Montague Summers in his History of Witchcraft and Demonology (who also should be taken with a grain of salt) talks about how witches are sometimes conveyed to Sabbats \"mounted on a sticks or a broom, sometimes on a sheep or a goat, sometimes by a tall black man.\" and that at the Sabbat \"The Sorcerers worship the Devil who appears under the form of a tall black man, or as a goat. They offer him candles & kiss his posterior,\" and here Summers is, like Murray, citing and synthesizing from the witch-trial transcripts in his interpretation. For a more scholarly (but less accessible) discourse, check out \"Men in Black: Appearances of the Devil in Early Modern Scottish Witchcraft Discourse\" by Joyce Miller. Such depictions were influential in popular culture. H. P. Lovecraft in his story \"The Dreams in the Witch House\" was drawing on Murray when he wrote: The evilly grinning beldame still clutched him, and beyond the table stood a figure he had never seen before—a tall, lean man of dead black colouration but without the slightest sign of negroid features; wholly devoid of either hair or beard, and wearing as his only garment a shapeless robe of some heavy black fabric. His feet were indistinguishable because of the table and bench, but he must have been shod, since there was a clicking whenever he changed position. The man did not speak, and bore no trace of expression on his small, regular features. He merely pointed to a book of prodigious size which lay open on the table, while the beldame thrust a huge grey quill into Gilman’s right hand. Over everything was a pall of intensely maddening fear, and the climax was reached when the furry thing ran up the dreamer’s clothing to his shoulders and then down his left arm, finally biting him sharply in the wrist just below his cuff. As the blood spurted from this wound Gilman lapsed into a faint.',\n",
       " 'I can’t speak to the depiction of Satan as an Ethiopian, but I wouldn’t be surprised in the least. I can say, as an early modernist and early Americanist, that Satan was often depicted as an “other,” a member of a group feared or poorly understood, who was often culturally as well as physically different from the Christian European group being discussed. This extends to his acolytes. Witch accusations were typically leveled at those on the margins in local communities. Even exceptions, like Puritan minister George Burroughs, stood out in some way that marked them as exceptional in a way that drew suspicion. In Burroughs’ case, he was abnormally strong and managed to survive a Wabanaki raid that destroyed most of the settlements around York, Maine. More broadly, groups like the Jews and Native Americans were thought by a number of writers in the early modern age to be aligned with Satan. A popular idea in English Protestant theology is a duality in which anything God does has a Satanic antipode. Thus, if God has a chosen people, so does Satan. If God leads his chosen people to a promised land, Satan must do the same. So while any number of European colonizers thought converting the Native Americans was an easy and worthy goal, a large number also saw those people and their land as intrinsically disordered and evil (after all, since they weren’t mentioned in the Bible, perhaps they weren’t in God’s light). Regarding Satan specifically, the Puritans during the Salem witch craze described him as a “tall black man in a tall hat.” By black, they were not referring to African. The descriptions we have clearly point to Satan as a Native American in their mind. Satan often reflected the fears and prejudices that Europeans possessed, and this case was no different. While the overwhelming majority of the Salem accused were English, the supposed leader of the accused was their physical enemy, at home in a land they did not control.',\n",
       " 'I can speak for the tradecraft guilds (construction guilds, so masons and carpenters and plasters and such) in Europe during what I grew up calling The Middle Ages (a phrase AskHistorians has educated me beyond using, but still a useful guidepost). It’s safe to say that it would be very rare for tradecraft guilds to take care of disabled workers. Explaining why is a good window into the purposes of a guild. Today, trade craft guilds are highly associated with unions. Indeed, many of them are some of the oldest unions in the U.S. And so we’re accustomed to thinking of tradecraft guilds as unions—as organizations who care about the well being, financial and otherwise, of the workers in that guild. European guilds of the Middle Ages would find that concept shocking and foreign. Guilds did not exist to protect workers back then. They existed to protect the guild masters, who were almost exclusively business owners—the owners of the local masonry shops and carpentry shops, etc. Guilds existed to squash competition, fix prices, and assure quality of the finished product. In the three-tiered worked of guild hierarchies (apprentice, journeyman, master), the apprentices were completely fungible, the journeymen were only as valued as the profitability of their last project, and the masters were back in the office tallying the profits, a task that seldom crippled anyone. The rates of injury and fatality in the trade crafts were, bluntly, horrifying. Even up to what we’d call modern construction, in the U.S. in the first half of the 20th century, injury was essentially unavoidable if you stayed at it long enough. There’s a famous Depression-era quote about iron workers, where the author notes that, upon observation, every single man on the iron working crew was injured. Some had a limp, some a bad back, some an injured hand. But all were injured in a permanent way. Such was merely the state of the industry. And it wasn’t better historically, it was worse. It’s hard to cite a source for a negative. It’s not impossible, or even unreasonable, to suspect that here and there, now and then, you might find a guild member who was supported, official or otherwise, by the guild, by their fellow workers, or by the master they had worked for. But all of it would be acts of charity, not the normal operation of the guild. Bluntly, such was not the purpose of the guild. The guild existed for the masters, and for their business. Sources for the general operation, function, and purposes of the guilds: Ogilvie, Sheilagh; Institutions and European Trade: Merchant Guilds, 1000–1800 .',\n",
       " 'I can give you the Spanish perspective specifically, as immediately after the signing of the treaty of Paris of 1783, the Spanish ambassador to France (the Count of Aranda) sent a report to the King of Spain. He foresaw the USA becoming an \"irressistible colossus\", among other things due to the advantages a federative republic offered. I translate his words: I mistrust that the new power formed in a land where there is none to contain its projects will incommodate us when it shall be in condition to do so. This federative republic is born, so to speak, pygmy, for it has been given shape by two powers, Spain and France, helping with their forces to make it independent. Tomorrow it will be enormous, so far as it consolidates its constitution, and later shall it be an irressistible colossus in those regions. In that state, it will forget the benefits it has received from both powers and shall think only about its own enlargement. The freedom of religion, the ease to settle people on immense lands, and the advantages offered by that new form of government shall call in peasants and craftsmen from all nations, for man goes where he thinks he shall improve his fortune, and within few years shall we see, and deeply lament, the rise of the colossus I mentioned before. Enlarged that Anglo-American power, we shall think that its first goal shall be the entire possession of the Floridas in order to dominate the Mexican Gulf. Taken that step, shall it not only interrupt our commerce whenever it wants, but it shall aspire to conquer that vast empire, which we will not be able to defend from Europe against a large, formidable, power established in that continent and bordering that country. The count of Aranda was impressively politcally savvy, but I think that he could not have been the only one to see this coming. The whole idea of a confederation or a federal system was absolutely not alien to an Aragonese as Pedro Abarca de Bolea, count of Aranda, for before the decrees of Nueva Planta, and the Berwick decree, the territories of Spain did function like a confederation, and even the territories of the Crown of Aragon had been some sort of confederation under the monarchs of Aragon. This was also known by Juan Romero Alpuente, who comments in 1808 (Peninsular War), and compares the USA to the crown of Aragon. I translate: I abdicate, then, in favour of my great nation these august rights, for they can only be faithfully exercised with a well established Parliament, with removable proprietors and solemnly appointed by all of you, or drawn by incorruptible chance, in every element like the American United States, or my glorious kingdom of Aragon whose great princes would have always been great without the abuse of the obedient castilian forces and constitution The only thing new for the Aragonese count, or for Romero Alpuente would have been the republic, but that would be far from the truth. Republics had been known since the Roman times, and even more recent times had known highly succesful republics known for their wealth: Venice, Genova, Florence, or the Dutch Republic. Having removable officials, subject to accountability and responsibility was an advatage in and of itself. Alpuente does not mention it explicitly but a Parliament with inmovable, id est permanent, members would be an oligarchy, which would lead to corruption. In Aragon there was some sort of shared sovereignty between the king and the parliaments, notably evidenced by the protocol of the Cortes, where the Cortes (formed by members of the \"three arms\", ecclesiastical, royal, and military) would make their petitions to the king in first instance, with the king being second. This lead to the king having to cave to the demands made by the Cortes if he wanted any sort of levying of taxes done by the Parliament. That somewhat primitive checks and balances is not inappropriately equated to the United States, where power was exercised by both the President and the Congress.

       " \"Reparations were not usually only paid in cash or gold (or gold backed cash). In the case of Germany after WW1 for instance coal, machinery (particularly ships), timber etc all made up the payments as well as a system of bonds. Coal was really the main one though. Germany likely would not have been able to doctor photos or falsify accounts as their banking system was run under the auspice of allied occupiers enforcing non-german staffing quotas in the management of many institutions involved. This is not untypical of counties after losing a war. Even if they did falsify/change/increase suddenly the gold reserve numbers, and allies believed them because hypothetically they did a lax checking job and were very trusting, its unlikely the allies would have let them changed the 'gold' equivalency discussed during the treaty. The allies knew that Germany would either: 1) meddle the gold standard to kill the debt or 2) flip to a fiat/paper currency, inflate it, and kill the debt given half a chance. The allies therefore did not accept 'paper Marks' (immediately taken up after the war) - only 'gold Marks' (there is are exceptions regarding paper marks given to the occupying force in the Rhineland). The Germans did try and skirt this however with various tactics - selling paper marks for other currencies and inflating/meddling in forex + fixing dated contracts (for instance for reparation timber from suppliers in paper marks before giving it to the allies) and then hyperinflating the hell out of paper marks. Things like this. So countries were keen to your point and did take steps to make sure all payments were properly 'backed' meeting various degrees of success. &#x200B; this is an area of some debate\",\n",
       " 'This is a more complicated question that you might first think and there are a bunch of different aspects to get into when answering it. I\\'m going to split this answer into a few different sections for ease of reading, and because these factors are all related but can be treated a little independently. ___ 1. What was Anglo-Saxon Religion like? We don\\'t know. 2. Okay seriously, what was Anglo-Saxon Religion like? We don\\'t know much with any certainty. Our surviving sources from this time are not concerned with cataloguing the beliefs and practices of the Anglo-Saxon pagans. Our one, yes ONE, literary source that details the history of the English in this time period, written by the Venerable Bede an English monk in Northumbria, gives very little attention to the pagan practices of his forebears. Bede was living a generation after conversion to Christianity had completely taken England and while he was not a first hand witness to Anglo-Saxon pagan practices they were not that far from living memory, so in theory he could probably tell us a bit more than he actually does, but he didn\\'t care to, because why would he want to record primitive pagan superstition for posterity? Now he does offer us a few tantalizing glimpses. For example in his explanation on the English names for various months of the year he tells us that for example November was the Blot month, a blot being a harvest/feast/sacrifice. He also tells us for example that the pagan king of East Anglia, Rædwald, kept a temple devoted to numerous pagan deities as well as Christ, (and the famous Sutton Hoo ship burial from the same place and time does have both pagan and Christian elements within it) Bede also claims that the former high priest of the pagan gods in Northumbria personally oversaw the destruction of his old temple. So if we take Bede at face value we can at least posit the existence of some form of clerical structure and physical structures for the worship of pagan gods. However, if they did indeed exist, none have survived to the modern day or been firmly identified. So even though the names of various English gods and goddesses have survived into modern day, through days of the week most famously, we know next to nothing as to how they were worshiped/venerated, or even if they were. Many people try and fill in the gaps of what we know with parallels to Norse paganism but that is a bad idea for a host of reasons. The tl;dr is that Norse mythology as we know it today is not the religion of the vikings and even contemporary accounts are likely recording a uniquely elite experience with the tradition that was universal in neither time nor place. We do know, through later Christian sources (and some archaeological sources), that many people believed in local spirits and supernatural creatures, often referred to as elves for example, that were to be warded against and placated through offerings of grain and protective charms/prayers, and while this is an interesting mythological tidbit, it doesn\\'t tell us much about Anglo-Saxon paganism. One thing we do know for certain was that these pagan communities engaged in ritual sacrifices, both of material goods (often deposited underground or in wells), animal (especially horses), and potentially human (this is quite controversial and is nowhere near a settled issue), however archaeology cannot tell us the why behind the what. We know sacrifices were done, and even know what kinds of animals were common to sacrifice and can theorize as to why, but we cannot be firmly sure. It is also extremely important to keep in mind that at this time there was likely almost no homogeneity in the religious practices between the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Pagan practices in Northumbria likely bore little resemblance to those practiced in Wessex or in Wight which both probably varied over the centuries. Pagan priests, assuming they existed, likely had different rituals and practices all over the place. The role that the king played in pagan practices likely also varied significantly, and each of the kings in England at the time had little motivation to be exactly their neighbors, or more accurately their rivals. Keep in mind that at this time England was divided into innumerable smaller kingdoms, some of the larger ones survived into Christian times, such as the kingdoms of East Anglia, Wessex, Kent, Northumbria, Essex, Sussex, and Mercia, but scores of other kingdoms (if you want to even call them that) were also around at the same time, and eventually absorbed by these other polities. England was not united at this time, the language was not united, and there is no reason to think that the practices of the English were united either. 3. What was Early Medieval Christianity like? The Church that the Anglo-Saxons experienced was not terribly dissimilar from the one that eventually converted Scandinavia, though the clerics were mostly coming from Italy and Ireland. The former Roman lands of Italy, Gaul, Britain, and Iberia had all been converted, and the Roman Emperor Charlemagne had started to spread Christianity at the tip of a sword to the Saxons, the Slavs were starting to convert, and the Roman church was starting to take a shape into a more familiar form to modern people. However there were still some critical differences. Modern practices such as clerical celibacy, private confession, widespread access of communion, and so on were still some time off. However, Christianity had several things going for it at this time that made it stand out among the competing religions and traditions of early Medieval Europe, chief most among these were prestige and infrastructure. Christianity at this point was the religion of the Roman Empire. The Eastern Roman Empire had been Christian for centuries by this point,, and the Frankish kingdom in well...Francia, which had extensive relations with the English kingdom of Kent, was likewise Christian and under the authority of the Patriarch of Rome, popularly known as the Pope. This association with the most powerful realms in Europe made Christianity appealing as a prestigious good that could be given and traded, as well as influenced. Indeed the first Christian king of England had a Christian Frankish wife who was credited with paving the groundwork for his acceptance of Christianity. One of the most important aspects of Christianity is of course baptism, and it was a powerful tool in the arsenal of conversion, beyond the influence a Queen could wield (which was still quite considerable). Baptism, and the subsequent creation of God-Father/God-Son relationships was a powerful means of creating cohesion and loyalty in Early Medieval societies, especially given the highly personal nature of rule and loyalty in England at this time. Advanced bureaucracy, coercive legislation, etc.. and all those hallmarks of \"civilized\" rule were not in operation at this time. Christianity was also the gateway to greater trade opportunities, centralization, and infrastructure. Trading was often restricted, or attempted at least, between Christians and non-Christians, and many luxurious trade goods such as wine and Frankish jewelry (popular in pagan Anglo-Saxon England for example) were appealing to non-Christian populations. However of more direct import especially to would be convert kings, were the benefits that Christianity brought to a ruler\\'s administration and efforts to centralize authority. Latin literacy was a pre-requisite for the administration of medieval kingdoms (despite the presence of the vernacular in both Ecclesiastical and Secular literature in places such as England), and Latin literacy came through the Church. Furthermore a king who embraced Christianity could offer a more prestigious religion to his followers (mediated through baptism) that also brought alongside it greater connections, such as trade, to the powerful realms in Western and Southern Europe. This certainly followed in the case of Kent. After adopting Christianity Kent quickly was able to produce innovations such as a written law code and became a local military power. Finally, even at this early stage, Christianity was a more popular religion, and I mean that in the sense it appealed to the populace at large. As I pointed out above, popular participation in Norse paganism was limited, but this was not necessarily the case for Christianity. While weekly masses in the vernacular were still some ways off for the majority of the population, many parts of Western Europe were more directly engaged in religious practice (and not necessarily in a way that benefited them, I\\'m sure the peasants who worked on monastic land were not necessarily thrilled to be doing God\\'s work) in a way that pagans in England were not.',\n",

       " \"I'd start by saying that the conquests of various steppe peoples over the millennia are not all the same. The Mongols got as far as Poland and Hungary and were a global empire. The Huns under Attila were thought to be more localized, but were able to make incursions into Northern Italy and had also subjugated parts of modern day Germany. One answer that I have read is related to geography. European geography West and South of the Hungarian plain tends to be constricted and somewhat rugged. Particularly Northern Greece, Yugoslavia, Austria, Western Germany, Northern Italy, and Scandinavia. This results in there not being a lot of grassland for grazing compared to the vast steps of Russia or parts of Asia and even the Middle East. The lack of pasture creates logistics problems for large nomadic tribes, who were overwhelmingly heavy in horse cavalry in their army makeup and had to be able to support large herds. Western Europe is also hemmed in by seas, the Baltic/North Sea to the North and the Med to the South. This further constricts avenues of advance for an invading force unless that force is proficient in amphibious operations, which steppe tribes typically were not. A favorite strategic move by the Mongols was to invade a country with multiple armies from different directions to confuse and overwhelm their enemy. Again, this is harder to do the further West you go in Europe, where the terrain limits the ingress points for large cavalry armies. That type of terrain can also favor densely packed infantry formations over wide ranging armies of light cavalry, further negating the usual steppe advantage. So extended operations for steppe people into Western Europe was a logistical and tactical challenge that they weren't used to. The geography did not play to their strengths. I don't want to discount the actions of peoples in Western Europe in successfully checking steppe army incursions, such as the actions of Flavius Aetius against the Huns, nor the role of chance, such as the death of Genghis Khan just as the Mongol invasion of Europe was getting going. I'd also add that the Mongols at least are on record of being successful across a diverse geographic expanse. From the Russian steppes to the Middle East, and all through China and into Southeast Asia. Although the grazing in or adjacent to many of those areas was arguably superior to Western Europe. All that being said, I think Western Europe was probably a uniquely tough nut to crack due to its geography and its relative distance from Asia. Perhaps just as important, it may not have been seen as that valuable of a prize by an empire like the Mongols, due to what they would view as its geographic limitations and lack of wealth compared to China or other Asian kingdoms of the day.\",\n",
       " 'The ancient method of pen and paper was still in use (and is still in use today); this was a common method for amateur scientists, and was also in professional use. Photographic methods were also used. Of course, photography was a key method in optical astronomy, but it was used much more widely. For example, oscilloscope traces were photographed to record them, and this could be done on filmstrip to record a series of traces, one per frame. An advantage of photographic recording is that it isn\\'t necessary to have a measuring instrument that produces an electronic signal. Chart recorders, which you note, were in common use. The bandwidth of a pen-and-paper chart recorder is limited by how quickly the pen can be moved, and higher-speed recording used a moving beam of light and light-sensitive paper; the beam of light would typically be steered by a galvanometer-driven mirror. This principle of optical chart recording was quite, having been used by William Lawrence Bragg (i.e., Bragg Jr.) in 1916 when he was working on acoustic location of enemy artillery (Bragg recorded on movie film; his main motivation was to use the galvo-mirror as a mechanical amplifier, since vacuum tube systems, and therefore electronic amplifiers, were still in their infancy), The other widely-used method for high-speed data recording was magnetic tape. This was very common in radio astronomy which you ask about. Chart recorders were cheaper, and paper charts had the advantage of being human-readable. Magnetic tape had the advantage of the signal being easy to return to electrical form for further data processing. In the 1970s and later, astronomical data was typically stored on tape in a digital format; this required computers and processing power that wasn\\'t readily available to amateur scientists, but was only a small addition to the cost of building and operating a radio telescope. For very long baseline interferometry, data from the various telescopes was transferred to one location by physical transport of the tapes (as the old saying went, \"Never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of magnetic tape\"). Microcomputers and floppy disk drives were being used for data recording in the 1970s, although it took until the \\'80s for them to become common. \\'70s computers might be home-brew systems or off-the-shelf, and by the early \\'80s, off-the-shelf systems dominated. 8\" floppies were used in the early systems.

       " 'I got to know Jan Karski (1914-2000) and wrote his biography. When the centennial of his birth came around a few years ago, there was a vigorous debate in Poland about whether he had been born on \"IV/24,\" i.e. April 24, or \"VI/24,\" June 24. He was inclined to believe the latter date, but he said he had never cared about or celebrated his birthday. The April date was written in the parish register, but he said his mother told him his father had gotten drunk with the priest at the christening; hence the transposed date.',\n",
       " 'Since I cannot possibly word it better, I will provide an extract from the book: The Iroquois League united five principal Indian nations—the Mohawk, Onondaga, Seneca, Oneida, and Cayuga. Each of these nations had a council composed of delegates called sachems who were elected by the tribes of that nation. The Seneca Nation elected eight sachems to its council, the Mohawk and Oneida nations each had councils of nine sachems, the Cayuga Nation had a council of ten, and the Onondaga Nation had a council of fourteen. Each of these nations governed its own territory, and its own council met to decide the issues of public policy for each one. But these councils exercised jurisdiction over the internal concerns of that one nation only; in this regard they exercised powers somewhat like the individual governments of the colonies. In addition to the individual councils of each separate nation, the sachems formed a grand Council of the League in which all fifty sachems of the six nations sat together to discuss issues of common concern. The sachems represented their individual nations, but at the same time they represented the whole League of the Iroquois, thereby making the decisions of the council the law for all five nations. In this council each sachem had equal authority and privileges, with his power dependent on his oratorical power to persuade. The council met in the autumn of at least one year in five in a longhouse in the Onondaga Nation; if needed they could be called into session at other times as well. Their power extended to all matters of common concern among the member nations. Source: “Indian Givers.” (Jack Weatherford) In the same chapter Weatherford makes some more relevant interesting points: The League was founded sometime between 1000 CE and 1450 CE, by Hiawatha and Deganwidah under a constitution they called the Kaianerekowa or Great Law of Peace According to the Kaianerekowa the sachems were not chiefs (so it was not a position associated with war leadership) but lawmakers. If they had to go to war, they would have to leave the civil position. It was a common tradition in Indian tribes to have separate leaders for peace and war. A sachem could be impeached for improper behavior or if he lost the confidence of his electorate. (Here the author states that the women of his clan could impeach and expel him, and choose a new sachem. This implies that while sachems were men, the electorate was women, which I have no idea if it was always true). Upon election to Council a sachem would \"lose\" their name and be henceforth referred to by their title. Only one person was allowed to speak at a time during political meetings and no interruptions/yelling were allowed, the purpose of debate being to persuade and educate, not confront. The League was allowed to admit new members. The decimated and displaced Tuscaroras from North Carolina were admitted as the sixth nation in 1722, and more such groups were added later. The new groups were not lesser members. The League did not have a supreme leader, meaning consensus was vitally important. The Iroquois chief Canassatego was the first person to propose a federal model for the American colonies, speaking at an Indian-British assembly in Pennsylvania in July, 1744. His argument was to make it easier for the Indians to deal with different colonies, each with its own policy. Benjamin Franklin, when he was the official printer for the colony of Pennsylvania was responsible for the publication of the records of various Indian assemblies and treaty negotiations. Building on his now-famous curiosity he developed an expertise and interest in Indian matters and eventually was appointed Indian commissioner for the colony. He held this post in the 1750\\'s and became quite familiar with the political structure of the League of the Iroquois (in particular). Speaking to the Albany Congress in 1754, Franklin would echo the original proposal of Canassatego, and calling on the delegates of the various English colonies to unite and emulate the Iroquois League. In case it isn\\'t obvious, \"Indian\" here means Native American. I use that term both for ease of reading and also because the author uses it too. No offense intended of course.',\n",
       " 'In 1939, two weeks after Germany invaded Poland, the Soviet Union invaded from the other direction justifying it internationally as a protective action, but in actually part of the agreement to split Poland in two that came about in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Thousands upon thousands of Polish soldiers were captured by the Soviet Union and interned. They would be treated quite terribly at first, including the infamous Katyn Massacre which saw the mass execution of thousands of Polish officers Tens of thousands of civilians were arrested as well and sent eastward in forced relocations. But suddenly in mid-1941, Germany invades, and the USSR finds its lot thrown in with the Allied powers... including the Polish Government-in-Exile. Describing relations between the Poles and the Soviets over the next few years as \"strained\" would be an understatement, but there were points when they were able to sort of, kind of get along, and this little episode is one of them. Holding Polish POWs was now somewhat awkward for the Soviets, so an agreement was struck where a Polish force was raised within the Soviet Union under General Władysław Anders (who had been wounded fighting the Soviets, captured by them and imprisoned), known as the Anders Army. But again, things were strained. And the Anders Army felt that it was not being adequately trained or supplied - which was absolutely true, a mixture of Soviet anti-Polish sentiments exacerbated by simple logistical shortcomings which then of course, saw the Poles prioritized last, although a small, grim advantage was that many of the former prisoners were used to such meager rations. An early impression from a British officer laisoning with the Polish force noted: Every man looked half-starved. Their faces were grey, quite a different colour from those of ordinary people. Most of them looked as if they had been frost-bitten. They were living in tents. There were no houses, no wood except that which they pulled down with their own hands, no YMCA huts, no cinemas or shops, no town or village to which they could go. Yet when these men marched by ... they showed a spirit which was truly remarkable. They thought themselves in heaven after two years in labour camps. It was a complicated problem. By the beginning of 1942, now numbering 70,000 men, the Soviets were insisting the Poles go into battle immediately, while Anders was decrying that his mean remained half-starved, not to mention woefully under-equipped. After months of arguments, Anders could only get rations for half the men, and it was decided that the remainder would head to Iran - along with their families - where they would be equipped and supplied by the British, with eventual return to the USSR to fight on the Eastern Front. The Soviets and the British had just invaded Iran in August of 1941 due to a combination of factors, including opening up a critical supply-line for aid to the USSR, and as the Poles were training in Kazakstan, it was seen as the easiest route for them to take. So in March, 1942, cramped, miserable riverine journeys to the Caspian sea saw about 30,000 soldiers, and 12,400 Polish civilians arrive in Iran that spring, but unlike what was planned, they had no desire to return and fight under Soviet leadership! In essence, the cycle restarted, with more arguments, and pressure applied by the Soviets, including at least one which resulted in an outright murder of a Polish officer by an angry Soviet major, and the arrest of several Polish diplomats. The Polish troops who remained in the USSR by them believed they might very well need to march themselves out of the Soviet Union against hostile resistance, and of course the Soviets now had abandoned nearly any concern for the well-being of them or their dependents. finally, British intervention saved the day. Churchill sent a very cordial telegram to Stalin which allowed him to save face in letting the remaining Poles leave. The evacuation began in early August, 1942, and the last of the Polish soldiers entered Iran by the end of the month. Polish civilians were allowed to travel with them, but not without controversy. In the end, just under 30,000 civilians were allowed to leave with the second evacuation, but it was limited generally to those with direct familiar connections to the soldiers, and the NKVD would refuse any non-ethic Pole permission to board, mainly excluding Jews, but also some ethnic Ukrainians or Belosrussians who had been Polish citizens. Upon arrival in Iran, the Polish contingent was encamped outside Tehran, and then moved to Iraq - presumably now with a bear in tow - where the troops underwent training, and then westward to Gaza for more training, and formed into the Polish II Corps, although some were sent to Britain to help amplify the Polish forces there. Polish II Corps would eventually see action in Italy. Mainly sourced from `Halik Kochanski. Eagle Unbowed: Poland and the Poles in the Second World War. Harvard University Press, 2012`',\n",
       " \"British ships carried a small detachment of the Royal Marines, compared to the size of the crew. Hood's Royal Marine detachment consisted of four officers (a major, a captain and two lieutenants), 158 men and a boy, from a total crew of 1,400. The King George V class battleships had a larger detachment, with a total of 350 men. The Royal Marines were there to provide ships with a landing party, if necessary, but this was rare during WWII. Hood's Marines fought in Norway in 1940, while the ship was undergoing a refit, while the detachment from the battleship Ramillies made an amphibious landing during the Allied invasion of Madagascar in 1942. As such, most Royal Marines would only see service aboard ship. In this case, the Marines had several duties, both in and out of action. Where ships needed sentries - the spirit room, the boundary between officer's quarters and the men's accommodation, arms rooms and magazines outside of action - these came from the Royal Marine detachment. They might also form part of the ship's police force, helping to enforce naval law. The Marines also carried out menial work. Officers were entitled to servants, for tasks like laundry and cleaning. These servants were drawn from the Marine detachment. The Marines also provided the ships' butchers and her postal service. Large ships were provided with a Marine band for ceremonial occasions. The band also played a large role in recreation aboard ship, playing popular music for the crew. In a battle, the main role of the Marines was manning a section of the ship's armament. Traditionally, the Marines operated 'X' turret, the third turret aft of the bow of the ship. The Marines would also operate part of the ship's secondary armament and AA guns. In this role, they operated much as the typical seaman did, moving and loading ammunition, training the turrets and elevating the guns and so on. Other parts of the Marine detachment would be available for damage control if needed. The sentries would remain in position, with the exception of those guarding the magazines. The Marine bandsmen might seem useless in action, but in fact they had one of the most important roles in the ship. They manned the 'transmitting station'. This was the room, buried deep in the hull, which housed the ship's fire control systems. These were complex electromechanical computers, which required considerable finess to use well; bandsmen were seen to have the fine motor skills necessary for effective use of these systems.\",\n",
       " 'Because Hitler (or to be precise, the Third Reich) was cynically pragmatist. They had no qualms about enlisting whoever might help them to achieve their goals and they were more than happy to \"extend\" their racial policy to include them. As for the Croats and Bosnian Muslims... The Croatian Ustashe regime in the Nazi-puppet state of Croatia began its life as a relatively small but fanatical separatist movement in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Its initial sponsors were Italy and Hungary, but as late as 1938, Nazi Germany armed and sponsored them. The Nazis needed Ustashes to supress the Serbian influence in Yugoslavia. The Nazis (correctly) assumed that the majority Serbian sentiment was anti-Nazi and, after the 1941 occupation and creation of the Independent State of Croatia, they allowed the Ustashes to organise a campaign of ethnic cleansing which took the lives of hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews and Roma. The Third Reich officially treated Croats, a Slavic nation with Slavic language, as a Germanic nation. While this made little or no sense, it was a convenient \"explanation\" for the alliance with Ustashes. However, the Bosnian Muslims were in a peculiar position, due to strong religious identity, but at the time relatively undeveloped national identity (some considered themselves to be Turks, others to be muslim Serbs). Due to strong Ustashe propaganda claiming the Bosnian Muslims were simply \"Croats gone astray\", some joined the Ustashe militia (Independent State of Croatia included the territory of Bosnia). For those Bosnian Muslims who did not and would not identify as Croats, the Nazis came up with a solution - the SS Handžar division. That\\'s right, a Muslim Waffen SS, complete with an imam. The same concept was used to recruit Kosovo Albanians to fight against the partisans - this time, it was named SS Skenderbeg. Oddly enough, the concept of \"Aryanship\" was not expanded to include the Bosnian or Albanian SS.',\n",
       " \"I am wondered if there are any good sources from Anglo-Saxons writing about Viking culture or life. King Alfred the Great of Wessex (d. 899) who was famous for his struggle with the Danish raiders also commissioned to translate Latin Orosius' History against the Pagans into Old English, with some additions on the geography in Northern Europe. In this additional section, we can find the summary of the description of now Norway (called Norð-weg, 'Northern Way' in literal translation), based on the oral account of the Norseman, Ohthere (rendered Óttar in Old Norse, and Ottar in modern Norwegian). Ohthere was apparently not the raider, but a kind of merchant-like figure who was also a chieftain in his homeland, Hålogaland in Northern Norway, accumulating the wealth by hunting and taking the tribute from arctic hunting-gathering people, the Finns (usually identified as modern Sámi people). He even presented the walrus tusk hunted in the far north to King Alfred. This account is also an indispensable source value for the ethnography of different arctic and sub-arctic peoples around Fenno-Scandia in the late 9th century, since Ohthere once seemed to take a journey around the northernmost part of Scandinavian into the White Sea, and the account also includes some groups of people he met in course of this voyage. The scribe also records the sea route he took from his homeland to two trading places in southern parts of Scandinavia, one of them was Hedeby (near now Schleswig) in south-eastern Jutland Peninsula. On the other hand, the continuation of the addition in Old English translation of Ororius also includes the description based on another informant, Wulfstan (who was usually identified with English) who narrated the voyage from Hedeby into the Baltic. While many researchers, both historians and literary scholars alike, have discussed the literary as well as the political motive of including these account into the translation work conducted in the court of West-Saxon ruler (Cf. Allport 2020. He argues that the incursion of the text was to show the 'symbolic' subjugation even of the Finns in the far north to King Alfred. Allport 2020: 274), I'd dare to say that these accounts, especially Ottar's one, are relatively less-biased on the life and society of the contemporary Scandinavians. The following Youtube video read the modern English translation of Ohthere's account, though I've not checked the details on the identification of some groups of people and translation by myself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPMkEHJ928 I've read a lot about travellers...... Generally speaking, however, we cannot expect to find many of such kind of English (Anglo-Saxon) 'travel account' in the first millennium in Early Medieval Europe, since it was not so customary then for the contemporary people (especially Christians) to record their travel, possibly except for the pilgrim diary. As I illustrated in Just how different were Viking era Scandinavian countries from each other? the large scale as well as stable kingdoms in Viking Age Scandinavia had essentially not appeared until Late Viking Ages, so not so many English people who also had an important business to record probably took a visit in Scandinavia in person then. As an example of this kind of text is the (hagiographic) Life of St. Ansgar who went to preach Christianity in Denmark and in Central Sweden from the 830s to the 850s. Another relatively less-prejudiced text worth checking for pre-1066 period is probably Encomium Emmae Reginae (the Praise for Queen Emma), though the text itself was written in Flanders in ca. 1040. Queen Emma (d. 1052) was a daughter of Duke Richard I of Normandy, and re-married with King Cnut the Great of the Danes (d. 1035). In the first chapter of this text, King Sweyn Forkbeard of the Danes, that is to say, her second father-in-law, is depicted rather positively, in contrast with some German accounts like Adam of Bremen that the traditional half-pagan and cruel (revolted against his father, Harald Bluetooth) figure of Sweyn was largely based on. The revaluation of Sweyn Forkbeard as a military commander as well as a Christian ruler in Scandinavia has greatly progressed since ca. 1990, and the pioneering article of this trend by Peter H. Sawyer actually focus on the portrait of Sweyn described in EER rather than traditional Adam the German. In fact, there were some accounts by the English (Anglo-Saxons) that also includes some description of Scandinavia even after the Norman Conquest (some of the Anglo-Saxon churchmen was invited to Scandinavia by the ruler, or even some others took temporary asylum in Scandinavia from the political chaos after the Conquest), but I assume this is an another story and not the direct focus of OP's question.

       " 'That depends on the nature of the \"treachery\". Many Wehrmacht and SS officials - especially Judges - were able to start over in the West German Government due to currying favor. For example, the former SS man Paul Dickopf gave the Allies some secret intelligence about the Holocaust, and later found himself in a position of leadership in the BKA, and even served as the president of Interpol in the late 60s. There\\'s also the case of Hans Globke, one of the lawyers who wrote the commentary on the Nuremberg laws and was one of the main perpetrators of the persecution of the Jews. Towards the end of the war, he served the Allies as a translator, was cleared by a Denazification court, and eventually became the National security adviser to Konrad Adenauer. This caused such a scandal that Adenauer\\'s government froze vital arms trade with Israel in 1960 to make sure Adolf Eichmann wouldn\\'t implicate Globke in the Holocaust. Now, contrast these with the case of Erich Von Dem Bach Zelewski, a former SS man and Holocaust perpetrator. Zelewski expressed remorse for his crimes and openly admitted on several occasions that the Holocaust happened and was a horrible act of mass murder. Whereas most Nazis got sentences ranging from a few days to about less than ten years, Bach Zelewski was randomly prosecuted for the murder of German Communists in the 30s, and sentenced to 10 years in prison, where he died in 1972. Saving your own skin and gaining favors with the Allies was fine, so long as you didn\\'t say anything bad about the Regime. The BKA under Paul Dickopf persecuted Roma and spied on West German politicians accused of treason. He continued being a Nazi and was rewarded for it. In contrast, Zelewski was harshly punished by the \"Old Guard\" for his perceived betrayal of the Regime by condemning Nazi crimes.',\n",

       " \"By VE Day the French armed forces in Europe could muster twenty divisions, the best of which were the three armored divisions and five infantry divisions of the First Army that had invaded Germany under the command of Jean de Lattre de Tassigny. The First Army was part of the US supply chain and under the overall command of General Jacob Devers's Sixth Army Group. The rest of the French Army consisted of second-rate divisions that had been formed recently from FFI manpower and which were employed in Germany as occupation troops, along the Alpine border with Italy, and to besiege the pockets of German resistance which remained in Atlantic ports like Lorient and Saint-Nazaire. There was also a division raised to fight Japan in the far-east, but the Pacific War ended before it could be employed. If the war against Germany had continued for longer, more divisions would have been raised to constitute a Second French Army for the Western Front. Compared to other liberated nations, the amount of men and material France could put in the field in 1945 was truly impressive. How were they able to do it? First and foremost, through the lend-lease of Allied (mostly American) equipment. However, this wealth of military aid, and the opportunities to use it, would never have come without the inflexible insistence by Charles de Gaulle that France be treated as an equal Allied power rather than a liberated nation, nor without the capable manpower supplied first by France's African colonies, and later by the French Forces of the Interior in metropolitan France.\",\n",
       " 'This is a truly fascinating question with numerous layers. Let\\'s start at the beginning: It\\'s clear that the early Arab conquests were focused on Palestine and Greater Roman Syria. \"Romanized\" Arab tribes were part of these early armies - so there was already some existing cultural cross-pollination going on once the dust had settled after the conquest of Jerusalem and Damascus. One may compare it to the germanic tribes that ended up conquering the Western Roman Empire - they had (to varying degrees) Romanized elites, romanized militaries, etc. The Roman Empire soon became the primary \"enemy\" of the fledging Arab Empire. Keep this important note in mind, as it would change the dynamic in how Roman and early Islamic Civilizations would interact with one another. The Arabs had conquered the Romans\\' most prized provinces - and within 40 years of Muhammad\\'s death would be at the walls of Constantinople conducting their first siege of the city. Let\\'s move to the more obvious early impacts that Roman culture had on this nascent Arab Empire and later Islamic civilization. Hisham\\'s Palace The Great Mosque of Damascus The Dome of the Rock and Al-Zaytuna Mosque are all early Arab/Islamic structures that have clear Roman architectural influence. The famous Roman arches are seen throughout Islamic architecture in North Africa and the Levant during this time period. In terms of academic, philosophical and intellectual influence - this is another interesting realm. The influence of the Greek tradition in Islamic philosophy/theology is, in my opinion, too often romanticized by secular academics in the west. There were platonic (mostly in Shi\\'a Ismailism) and aristotelean (Mu\\'tazilites, Ibn Rushd) influences found in heterodox muslim philosophical circles, but, again I think the broader philosophical tradition of Sunni Islam, Roman/Greek influences are often exaggerated here in the West. Regarding the Ottomans, it\\'s true that Mehmet II considered himself the heir of Roman civilization, but this didn\\'t trickle down into the average Ottoman muslim. Although much of the political and military elite in the Ottoman Empire would have been of Balkan European stock, this didn\\'t change the fact that they would have identified as Muslims first and not Romans. The Greek christians would have been considered the Romans in the Ottoman empire. Finally, The Persians. One would assume that because the Arab conquests conquered the wealthy Roman provinces of North Africa, Egypt, Syria and Palestine, that this early Islamic civilization would have had a de facto Romanized character to it. However, the Arabs would end up fully conquering an empire to the east - the vast and ancient Persian empire - that would end up influencing Islamic Civilization to a remarkable degree. Once could argue that once the Persians began converting en masse to Islam, that we start actually start to see a distinct Islamic Civilization emerge. The \"Persianization\" of the early Arab and eventual Islamic empires would become a phenomenon that had lasting effects through Egypt, Constantinople, Central Asia and the Indian Subcontinent. I\\'d argue that the Ottomans were more Persianized than Romanized. Many people don\\'t realize that Persian, not Arabic was the lingua franca for a huge part of Islamic Civilization. TL;DR - The early Arab Empire and later Islamic Civilization didn\\'t really become Romanized because the Arabs would end up completely conquering and absorbing a greater empire - The Persian Empire. Islamic theology, the Arabic language and grammar, government bureaucracy, art and architecture, poetry, music, etc, were all immensely influenced by the Persians. Personally, I think if the Persians hadn\\'t converted to Islam en masse in the 9th and 10th centuries, we wouldn\\'t have Islamic Civilization as we know it today. I\\'ll end with a quote from the great North African scholar Ibn Khaldun: \"…It is a remarkable fact that, with few exceptions, most Muslim scholars…in the intellectual sciences have been non-Arabs…thus the founders of grammar were Sibawaih and after him, al-Farisi and Az-Zajjaj. All of them were of Persian descent…they invented rules of (Arabic) grammar…great jurists were Persians… only the Persians engaged in the task of preserving knowledge and writing systematic scholarly works. Thus the truth of the statement of the prophet becomes apparent, ‘If learning were suspended in the highest parts of heaven the Persians would attain it”…The intellectual sciences were also the preserve of the Persians, left alone by the Arabs, who did not cultivate them…as was the case with all crafts…This situation continued in the cities as long as the Persians and Persian countries, Iraq, Khorasan and Transoxiana (modern Central Asia), retained their sedentary culture.”',\n",

       " 'Although prehistoric animal bones are often put forward as an explanation for dragon beliefs, there is no proof of this. It is pure speculation. Indeed, the idea that dinosaur bones inspired traditions involving dragons has become a matter of modern folk belief. While many things including dinosaur bones can put wind in the sail of tradition, there is no evidence that they could actually inspire any given tradition. Folklore doesn\\'t tend to work that way: \"Hey, this is something odd I just found, I bet it exists because long ago there must have been ... fill in the blank with a new creature giants, cyclopes, dragons.\" Such a scenario is only speculation, cannot be confirmed, and runs counter to what has been documented by folklorists and ethnologists. Instead, the process can work like this: \"I believe in fill in the blank and look what I just found; I wonder if this is a remnant of those creatures.\" This option is not impossible, and it is easy to imagine. Unfortunately, enthusiasts often take the second scenario and transform it into the first with no evidence except their own imagination. For example, many people have claimed that mammoth skulls are the explanation for the cyclops motif, but there is absolutely no evidence to conclude that this was the origin of the tradition. Dragons were generally believed to have existed, but the folk typically relegated them to distant times or places. There are no legends of people coming upon them in the wild. Even the celebrated observation in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle of dragons being seen in the clouds is a literary report that was likely something the chronicler heard - a legend from a distant place. Whether we can regard that as an exception or not, folklorists working with pre-modern informants did not collect western/northern European legends about encounters with dragons. People did believe they once existed, and these entities do figure in folktales, because these fictional stories were often set in remote places and times - \"Once upon a time, ...\".',\n",

       " \"It would largely depend on the extent of the injury, the response of the enslaved, and the inclination of the enslaver. This question relates to how enslavers dealt with enslaved women and men that had become too old or infirm to work efficiently. Provided the disability allowed for some form of labor, the enslaver might choose try to retain their human capital. In the event the disabled individual was unable to work at all or could only work at an inefficient rate, the enslaver might still keep them and allow them to live out their days in order to try to cast themselves as paternalists. Advocates for southern slavery, particularly in the antebellum period, actually boasted that they did not simply dispense with their slaves once they could no longer work in the way that northerners did with their wage laborers. Of course, they did so specifically to undercut abolitionist and anti-slavery arguments, and in reality, many enslavers sought to sell slaves no longer able to labor. Enslavers and slave traders regularly sought to mask any infirmities or disabilities of an enslaved person at market. An sick slave might be given food or clothing that might mask their illness, and traders regularly lied about an enslaved person's ability and age. This would have extended to any disabilities as well, and enslavers simply would have tried to hide an enslaved person's disability to complete the sale. The agency of the enslaved individual being sold also came into play, as slaves regularly manipulated the market in their favor when they could do so. Slaves often undercut their enslavers that put them up for sale, announcing their true age or any injuries they might have in order to remain on their enslaver's plantation (due to familial ties, communal ties, or a host of other reasons). On the other hand, they might seek to hide their disability, age, or sickness and cooperate in order to escape their current situation or to simply avoid punishment. These would have generally been the two immediate options; keeping on the enslaved person until their death or sale, but there were other even more horrific avenues available to enslavers. By the antebellum period, states had in place laws preventing enslavers from executing their human property, but enslavers were nothing if not grotesquely creative. Certain jobs were higher risk than others, and an enslaver could have easily placed a disabled slave in situations likely to result in their eventual death, either by assigning dangerous jobs or simply overworking them.

       " 'I can\\'t really speak to California\\'s Inland Empire, but as a heritage worker and high school teacher in BC\\'s Interior, I\\'ll try my hand at answering Washington\\'s Inland Empire and more broadly the term \\'Inland Empire\\' in general - it gets applied in more places than you\\'d think! Ultimately it\\'s a story of the intersection of developing media and the drive to map and survey the inland parts of the former Oregon Territory, both the British and later Canadian, and United States surveys sought to create accurate maps of their new territories, especially after the Oregon Treaty in 1846. What you might notice if you ever look at maps of the interior of Washington, Oregon, and British Columbia up until the 1890s is how empty of settlement they are outside of major travel routes, and you don\\'t even see regional names emerging in these regions until the 1870s and 1880s, and the idea of broader regional identities like an \"Inland Empire\" wouldn\\'t emerge until much later. In fact, it is newspapers where you first see the term \"Inland Empire\" used, well before any concerted settlement of the interior of the Pacific Northwest. The earliest uses in the region are in late 1870s and early 1880s in newspapers in Seattle and Vancouver to refer the opportunity available in settling the inland parts of the region. However, the term \\'Inland Empire\\' appears in Idaho, Montana, and the Dakotas as early as 1869 as terms for regions also recently opened for settlement there. It doesn\\'t seem to be until the late 1890s and first few decades of the 20th century that any coherent idea of \"The Inland Empire\" emerges in the Okanagan/Okanogan area, with Spokane at its heart. Indeed, the local papers like the Spokane Press and Spokane Woman regularly making reference to the region as such. In the same period, British Columbia is also referring to the regions surrounding the developing centres of Kamloops and Kelowna as the \"Inland Empire,\" and are even applying it to maps of the time. In 1944, photographer Erskine Burnett even publishes an album of his photos from the BC Interior called \"BC\\'s Inland Empire\" and the name continues to be used in both Washington and B.C. until the 1960s. By then, the strong regional identity seems to be diminishing as people migrated in the postwar era, and today the name endures mostly around Spokane, especially in relation to heritage or regional identity. If I\\'m to go outside my knowledge on this, I would even hazard that California\\'s \"Inland Empire\" could have a similar origin, as the area was settled expanding out from the already major centres of San Jose and Los Angeles, and seems to be a term that was used outside even California and the Pacific Northwest to refer to inland areas of new settlement.

       " 'As you already stated yourself: Russia isn\\'t actually densely populated. With a population density of 8,4 people per square kilometer it\\'s in fact very sparsely populated. Compared to other European countries like for example Germany , the Netherlands or the UK Russia seems almost empty. Now we have to look where the 144 million inhabitants of Russia are concentrated. For this we can have a look at this graphic: As we can easily see the majority of Russia\\'s population is located in south-western regions of the country. Now are those regions really so \"far up north\" and \"freezing cold\" as you seem to imagine? Even Moscow which is higher in the north than most of the dense populated regions is \"only\" at 55° north. That\\'s on the same latitude as cities like Edinburgh or Copenhagen, only a bit farther north than Manchester or Hamburg and significantly farther south than Scandinavian capitals like Oslo, Helsinki and Stockholm. Certainly: The continental climate of Russia is harsher in the winter than it is in cities more to the west. But it\\'s not the north pole. If we look at the other hand at the densely populated areas close to the black sea, we recognize that they are actually on the same latitude as cities in southern European countries. Krasnodar for example has a climate chart that is quite similar to what you find in northern Italy. Significantly warmer than Berlin, for example. &#x200B; So we can conclude that the parts of Russia that are densely populated are mostly not so very much different from the rest of Europe. &#x200B; Besides this: Having a harsher climate than other regions isn\\'t only bad and it\\'s by far not the only factor that makes a region habitable. The \"black soil\" that is found in southern (mostly south-western) Russia (and Ukraine) is very good for agriculture. When it comes to goodconditions for grain production that\\'s the region you want to look at. More fertile than almost anywhere else in Europe. &#x200B; I addition to what I already stated we also have to consider that soviet politics aimed for an urbanization and centralization. This means that many Russian cities are more heavily populated than they\\'d be if only climate, agricultural fertility etc. were the deciding factors. So if it wasn\\'t for the influence of the government, the population of Russia probably would be even more concentrated in the fertile and milder regions and not so much in the urban centers.',\n",
       " \"There were concerns about German use of radiological warfare with regards to D-Day, and plans were made to deploy teams with Geiger counters during the invasion (Operation PEPPERMINT). In the end, they weren't put into effect, though, because there was no strong evidence of a German radiological warfare program. I have written a bit about this here. Whether such a thing was used prior to FDR's visit to Casablanca, I don't know specifically, but it's not totally anachronistic.\",\n",
       " \"In the late 1920s women used to paint a glow-in-the-dark substance on the faces of watches called radium for the United States Radium Corporation and the Luminite Corporation. In the late 20's many of them began to suffer debilitating periodontal disease that one doctor seemed to think resembled the symptoms that Swedish workers endured after painting phosphorus on matches. The workers would often lick the paint brushes to obtain a fine point. This turned out to be radium poisoning and several large lawsuits were filed by the women who did this work against the two corporations. The Geiger counters were to “to guard against the presence of radium which may be used in an attempt to injure the President.” It was a standard Presidential protection measure that had been added along with many others after Pearl Harbor. Obviously the effects of radium poisoning were well-known at the time.

       " 'Hi, your question is a bit lose. First, after the second world war Germany itself didn\\'t thought about an army/navy. Germany was occupied, and nobody wanted an army any more. So our (im German) constitution, the Grundgesetz, doesn\\'t mention an army at all. With the tensions growing in the Cold war, West Germany first made, with the advice from Eisenhower, a Paramilitary Police called the Bundesgrenzschutz. A better equip Police for as boarder guards. Then 1952 east Germany went on to form the NVA (Nationale Verteidigungs Armee), so Westgermany got the approval from the Occupied forces to rise an own Army. So, Westgermany needed to extend its constitution, the Grundgesetzt. We added a \"Wehrverfassung\" to the Grundgesetzt. Art. 87a 1Der Bund stellt Streitkräfte zur Verteidigung auf. 2Ihre zahlenmäßige Stärke und die Grundzüge ihrer Organisation müssen sich aus dem Haushaltsplan ergeben. Außer zur Verteidigung dürfen die Streitkräfte nur eingesetzt werden, soweit dieses Grundgesetz es ausdrücklich zuläßt. 1Die Streitkräfte haben im Verteidigungsfalle und im Spannungsfalle die Befugnis, zivile Objekte zu schützen und Aufgaben der Verkehrsregelung wahrzunehmen, soweit dies zur Erfüllung ihres Verteidigungsauftrages erforderlich ist. 2Außerdem kann den Streitkräften im Verteidigungsfalle und im Spannungsfalle der Schutz ziviler Objekte auch zur Unterstützung polizeilicher Maßnahmen übertragen werden; die Streitkräfte wirken dabei mit den zuständigen Behörden zusammen. 1Zur Abwehr einer drohenden Gefahr für den Bestand oder die freiheitliche demokratische Grundordnung des Bundes oder eines Landes kann die Bundesregierung, wenn die Voraussetzungen des Artikels 91 Abs. 2 vorliegen und die Polizeikräfte sowie der Bundesgrenzschutz nicht ausreichen, Streitkräfte zur Unterstützung der Polizei und des Bundesgrenzschutzes beim Schutze von zivilen Objekten und bei der Bekämpfung organisierter und militärisch bewaffneter Aufständischer einsetzen. 2Der Einsatz von Streitkräften ist einzustellen, wenn der Bundestag oder der Bundesrat es verlangen. For the none Germans, short way: 1 The Bund organized the Forces for Defending. 2 Manpower and Organisation must be in budget. To use the Forces for otherwise, it must be allowed in the GG. Use of the Army in defense, defending civil objects and infrastructure. Even for military or political use. if the Police can\\'t handle a crisis, the Bundeswehr can help protecting civil objects. and there is: Art. 26 GG 1Handlungen, die geeignet sind und in der Absicht vorgenommen werden, das friedliche Zusammenleben der Völker zu stören, insbesondere die Führung eines Angriffskrieges vorzubereiten, sind verfassungswidrig. 2Sie sind unter Strafe zu stellen. 1Zur Kriegsführung bestimmte Waffen dürfen nur mit Genehmigung der Bundesregierung hergestellt, befördert und in Verkehr gebracht werden. 2Das Nähere regelt ein Bundesgesetz. This part in the GG: everything you do, to disturb the peaceful coexistent s of the people is put under punishment. For warfare used weapons are only be produced, and be sold, with aprovement of the government. &#x200B; That are the 2 main article of the GG, for the Bundeswehr. Germany can defend his Ally\\'s, but after 9/11 we changed our view on what an attack on an ally could be, and is. &#x200B; So, for the Germans are nuclear weapons an aggressive use, so not for defending. But the Luftwaffe (Air force) can use 20 bombs from an american base. A aircraft carrier is also, an aggressive weapon, the same is for bigger submarines. Even when we get a European Army, the German Army will still fall under this restrictions. &#x200B; TL/DR: The only why it would change, would be a new Constitution, and this will not happen. &#x200B; And again, i only know German Literature to this: Why only deffensive Army: Bremm, Klaus-Jürgen, Mack, Hans-Hubertus & Rink, Martin .

       " 'Perception matters when it comes to living standards. There is a phenomenon known as anchoring, you can read about it in books on Behavioural Economics such as Nudge by Thaler and Sunstein, it shows the effect of an anchor on the perception of statistics. I forget the exact study, but it went something similar to this. \"Is the tallest tree above or below 1000 Yards, guess with your estimate\" people guessed about 800 yards. If you ask people \"Guess the height of the tallest tree in yards\" and they guess about 200 yards. Now, this isn\\'t a perfect analogy, but it works similarly. Each day, we roughly assess our chances of dying, getting sick, or injured, and we mostly assume its rather low. Therefore, if I told you there is a 1 in 1000 chance of dying today, you\\'d be fairly concerned. Its low, but if every day was like that, you\\'d be dead in under 3 years. Therefore, you\\'re going to spend the day fairly flustered. However, if a plague is going around, its medieval Europe, and people are dropping daily, if I said you have a 1 in 1000 chance of dying, your perception is going to be fairly good. Connected to the first point its area-specific too. For example on womans rights, Michael Woods \"The Story of China\" excellently includes a hefty dose of female literature and if we look at the Qing dynasty as just one example, authors are divided on whether it is a brilliant time to be a woman or an awful time. On one hand, there are impossible beauty standards, foot binding, and seclusion, on the other hand, Woman authors can get published. Similar goes for the Working class in different era\\'s, we tend not to notice our present conditions unless there is something to meaningfully compare them to, therefore it also depends on your own experience. Marx needed to see urban worker classes next to wealthier aristocrat classes. However, it usually takes an alternative being visible for one to be able to perceive change or something different. You can of course question where things like the first revolutionaries come from, but often they have to \"invent\" or imagine the alternative, or its just the culmination of gradual progress. For example, Americans in the war of Independence somewhat harked back to an imagined time of particularly English virtue, which in some ways harked back to a time before the \"norman yoke\" etc as a form of contrast between the then and now. For example, what will people look at our generation for and think is positively ghastly? Eating meat perhaps? Any sort of carbon emissions? Paying for university education? Any sort of Inequality? Or will they think we went off the rails, dangerously modern ideas, multiculturalism? Globalisation? Who knows, but perception is the key to everything. &#x200B; (Note: I chose multiple things that could be \"ghastly\" to maintain some sort of political neutrality)',\n",
       " 'I try to give answers to specific points: -Terrible life expectancy It\\'s important to remember that average life expectancy at birth isn\\'t a good indicator of how long people actually lived. High infant mortality suppresses that number by a lot. -One third of the world being slaves with no rights, some born into it Slavery is bad; but there are different versions. Most people think of American style chattel slavery. But in other cultures there was a wider range, with some people treated like animals, and some like parts of the extended family. -Constant war, if you’re a man, the expectation to fight for your country Not everyone was expected to fight for his ruler/country. Mass conscription is an invention (or reinvention) of the French revolution and the Napoleonic wars. Of course if public order breaks down you\\'d better get yourself armed if invaders come. -Oppression of women That\\'s not as black and white as media presents it. Most people back in the day were farmers. So as man you had the career choice of becoming a farmer and do hard field work, and also some household stuff, and as a woman you had the career choice of doing household stuff and some hard field work. Not really that much difference. Also, it is important that when your hear a \"feminist critique\" you actually hear \"western upper class feminist critique\". This is somewhat based in the idea of the individual, and that only traditional male roles are worth pursuing. The idea that the family unit is important (that is the combined resources of wife, husband, parents, siblings, children are indicators of success) isn\\'t really explored. And neither the informal power woman used to wield. An example for this is the late Chinese Han dynasty. Officially the Emperor was the total ruler of everyone, behind the curtains he was a puppet of various women and eunuchs at court. -Ridiculously harsh punishments for crimes, like being thrown into an arena to fight in Rome The key here is that this was for crimes, something people caused themselves. And culture is the key. The people back then just were more used to cruelty. To make a current example, the US justice system is very brutal compared to the Nordic countries systems, yet people in the USA still can be happy. Unless they get caught by the system. -Disease with no medicine That did suck. Catastrophies like the Black Death did leave a mark on people and culture. -Duelling to death over petty things That was something for nobility. Not everyone had the right to challenge everyone else to a duel.',\n",
       " \"A mod pointed out the ambiguity in 'Silk Road', I've chosen here to focus simply on the problems of long distance overland trade routes in the first millennium, especially across the mountainous regions from what is modern Pakistan/Afghanistan, through the Tarim Basin to China, what are sometimes known as the northern and southern silk routes by specialists Absolutely. I cannot give you details and a page reference (lockdown limitations) but you might wish to look at the accounts of Chinese Buddhist pilgrims who traveled to India. Famous monks like Faxian, I-Tsing, or Hsuan-Tsang talk about the dangers of being robbed. In fact Buddhist texts often talk about the danger or robbery for travelling monks or nuns. Part of the issue is that travel meant passing through a lot of places that were just not effectively governed. There is a book by Scott called The Art of Not Being Governed in which he argues (his examples are all drawn from SE Asia) that most forested, hilly, or mountainous land, essentially everything you don't grow regular crops on, fell outside the purview of large well-organised states, and obviously that means they would not necessarily be very safe. Obviously people could protect themselves, on occasion states (large and small) would give guides and guards to travelers to escort them to the next safe place, but this was very haphazard. It might depend on the whim of a local prince, it might be a duty enforced on a local community, at some periods Chinese troops maintained garrisons well beyond their own territory but how much help they actually offered is unclear. And of course there is all sorts of different levels of robbery, there might be thefts of opportunity, or bands of robbers, or just local people enforcing tolls. That is a practice we are not used to today but routinely you might encounter someone demanding a proportion of your goods at a convenient choke point like a river crossing. And some of those were well regulated taxes and some were ad hoc local arrangements, but I doubt as a traveler that would feel very different. This is one of the reasons that people in pre-modern trade had parts of their family living along the routes they traveled, to help them negotiate each step of the journey. For example, in the mid-first millenium traders from Sogdia (modern Uzbekistan) were very active on the Silk Roads. We know that before crossing the mountains into the Tarim Basin (one of the most dangerous parts of the route as it was a politically very fragmented region) that they would gather at a particular place because they left a lot of graffiti there. And then once in the Tarim Basin they had family stationed in the cities all the way along the route until you reached China (a few letters survive). If you are interested in this period you might want to look at Etienne de la Vassiere's Sogdian Traders (its a translation of a French book which I think was based on his thesis). Sorry I cannot give you a better answer, but there were a very diverse range of circumstances and there are definite limits to my knowledge.\",\n",
       " 'Thomas Frost\\'s The Old Showmen and the Old London Fairs tells us what little we know of Gyngell\\'s appearances at fairs around London during the period from c.1798-1830. Frost suggests that Gyngell\\'s booth was a \"theatrical\" one – that is, one at which shows of various sorts were put on, rather than items sold. Gyngell seems to have combined exhibitions of conjuring with \"the fantoccini\", which was the contemporary term for a particular sort of puppet show, imported from Italy, which often told fairly elaborate stories for an audience of adults as well as children. This sort of exhibition derived ultimately from the masked tradition of the Commedia dell’Arte and diverged from it around 1700. Gyngell got his start when he was bequeathed an earlier show run by the famous John Flockton (d.1794), who – while a notably poor conjuror – was generally regarded as the greatest British showman of the later 18th century. Flockton\\'s name, according to Frost, \"can never be struck off Bartholomew roll\". We can get a better idea of what Gyngell was up to at the fair by taking a look at Flockton\\'s Bartholomew show of 1789, which, according to a contemporary playbill, comprised a Most Grand and Unparallelled Exhibition. Consisting, first, in the display of the Original and Universally admired Italian Fantoccini, exhibited in the same Skilful and Wonderful Manner, as well as Striking Imitations of Living Performers, as represented and exhibited before the Royal Family, and the most illustrious Characters in this Kingdom. Mr. Flockton will display his inimitable Dexterity of Hand, Different from all pretenders to the said Art. To which will be perform’d an ingenious and Spirited Opera called The Padlock. Principal vocal performers, Signor Giovanni Orsi and Signora Vidina. The whole to conclude with his grand and inimitable Musical Clock, at first view, a curious organ, exhibited three times before their Majesties. So this earlier show, at an earlier fair, combined puppetry, conjuring, and pocket-sized \"opera\" with displays of mechanical marvels – the \"Musical Clock\" referred to was said to contain no fewer than 500, or 900, figures, each depicting a different trade at work. Gyngell took over the show whole, and ran it as Flockton had done at first, but dropped the mechanical clock fairly early on. The puppets were kept on for longer, and we can get some idea of the performance from other sources; it probably combined British Punch & Judy with Italian-style tales, the latter typically featuring, among other characters, a trick puppet clown known as Scaramouche, which was equipped with a grotesquely extending neck that was used to intrigue and amuse children. The degree to which Scaramouche\\'s neck could stretch was hugely exaggerated for comic effect – William Hone’s popular Every-Day Book describes a performance in which Scaramouche appeared as ‘a clown without a head, who danced till his head came from between his shoulders to the wonder of the children, and, almost to their alarm, was elevated on a neck the full length of his body, which it thrust out ever and anon… presenting greater contortions than the human figure could possibly represent.’ Similarly, a 1799 bill advertising a New York puppet show announced that ‘a Curious Italian Scaramouch will dance a Fandango yes, I\\'m wondering too..., and put himself into twenty different shapes…’ Gyngell, Frost tells us, adopted the \"Grand medley\" name from another puppet-master, named Jobson, an innovator who had been prosecuted in 1797 for daring to make his puppets speak – this was held to be an infraction of the laws relating to theatrical licences. The term simply denoted a sort of variety show, though one in which the showman himself would typically adapt to put on different sorts of performance, rather than one requiring an extensive cast. In a Gyngell show, he himself might exhibit his conjuring tricks, and perform on \"the musical glasses\" (the old idea of filling a set of glasses to various depths, and conjuring sounds from them by wetting the rims and rubbing them with the fingers – which must have been hard to pull off effectively in a noisy fair environment...), while his wife sang between these exhibitions as part of the entertainment. Saunders, at the next-door booth, was essentially a circus man, but in a cramped locations such as Bartholomew Fair would put on theatricals, though hardly of the sort one would see at an established theatre – pantomime and melodrama, all of the sort that would not bore a standing audience that would quickly drift off to rival attractions if not kept entertained, was his sort of line. Shows of this sort tended towards such delights as Macbeth in 15 minutes, with a strong focus on the witches and the murders.

       " \"Details seem to vary by area, but yes - there were instances where matchlock firearms were loaded with paper cartridges. There were reports back into the late 16th Century of armies relying on paper cartridges for loading their firearms, particularly in Germany and Italy. By the time the 30 Years War rolled around in 1618, cartridge systems to easy loading would have been in regular use. However, based the 1608 drill manual of Jacob de Gheyn and other extant drill manuals from the period, the preferred method appears to have been to rely on wooden - rather than paper - cartridges suspended from bandoliers. These appear to have been used in a similar way to paper cartridges in that they allowed powder to be portioned out ahead of time, but bullets and priming powder would be carried separately from the wooden cartridges. This here is a particularly good demonstration of the manual. However, while this particular method is well documented, it's likely details differed between areas, particularly in futher flung regions like Japan and peripheries like Eastern Europe and the Balkans. I can't speak for those areas - modern demonstrations of Japanese Tanegashima matchlocks appear to use some kind of cartridge for reloading, but it's unclear as to whether or not that's something done out of convenience. Apparently, paper cartridges started to become more popular around the time flintlocks started to come into favor at the end of the 17th Century, but unfortunately I can't find something as clear as the de Gheyn manual of arms and it's not my area of expertise so I don't want to confuse things with blind conjecture. Whatever the case, paper cartridges absolutely appear to have been the norm by the time the Napoleonic Wars rolled around, and by the time rifled muskets came into use by the middle of the 19th Century, paper cartridges had become the standard means of loading.\",\n",
       " \"There are two factors that explain this: low amd stable inflation and a postive current account. Let's start from the first: one of the critical elements in the downfall of the weimar republic had been the hyperinflation that Germany experienced that severly damaged the credibility of the state, thus when it came to rebuild the state after the second world war the german CB had a strong anti-inflationary bias. In fact, while other countries in europe and america used inflation to reduce the debt and stimulate the economy (it was widely believed at the time that inflation automatically increased output, the so called Philip curve, now we know that it is no so simple), Germany kept generally inflation under 5% with few peaks usually related to exogenous events (such as the oil crisis). This reinforced the idea of the mark as a strong and stable currency, and so while others devalued (the UK and Italy for instance often run inflation in the duble digits), the german mark remained fairly stable Moreover Germany quickly recovered from the war and started to export its goods around the world in world, which caused the current account to be positive, this meant that money is flowing out of the country (to accumulate foreign assets), this increases the value of the currency because foreigners are buying it to buy your goods. Finally in the 1979, the members of the European community created the European Monetary system, a system of linked currency pegged to a virtual common currency and this forced CBs to accumulate marks to be able to sell it at a given rate. This explains both the appreciation of the mark and the increase in reserves of marks held at CBs.\",\n",
       " 'A classic \"Classical Historian\" answer: he certainly had sexual relations with women throughout his life, and his homosexual relations are the source of speculation. An important fact to consider (which OP mentioned in their question), is that in the ancient world, sexuality was not viewed in the binary way it has been viewed in the modern, and pre-modern world. The connection between sexuality and gender was largely a Victorian invention from the 1800s, and in the Roman and Greece classical domains, homosexual relationships would have been perfectly acceptable. For the purposes of this question however, that is where we leave the story of attitudes regarding sexuality, there are many great answers regarding this elsewhere on the site. This means that for Alexander III, there would not have been any great \"taboo\", regarding his relations, this does mean that Alexander III would not have faced any political implications due to these relationships, but they also may not have been of any significant note to have been written of. We know that he was married three times, and that he sired one legitimate heir, Alexander IV of Macedonia, who was born after the death of his father. So, we know that he certainly had relations with women. Many of the claims regarding Alexander\\'s sexuality come due to his relationship with his cavalry commander, Hephaestion. \"Mask of Command\" , which examined Alexander\\'s leadership style, shows the deep relationship between the two. They were childhood friends, and Hephaestion was an inner member of Alexander\\'s war council. They were said to be companions in everything and often would regale together. On Hephaestion\\'s death, Alexander weeped for days, and was said to have thrown himself upon his body. He gave Hephaestion an astoundingly lavish funeral, and requested for him to be remembered as a \"Divine Hero\". He also extinguished a special flame in Babylon, normally only done for the funeral of the King of Babylon himself. Alexander died shortly after the death of Hephaestion, and his wife wrote that she believed it was out of grief for his friend and the carelessness that he treated his health as a result of it. The level of admiration he held for his friend can also be seen as, in 2014, a tomb in Greece was uncovered, which for its time (325-300 BCE), would have not been surpassed by any others, even the tomb of Alexander\\'s father King Philip. It is the feeling of some that this is the tomb of Hephaestion. Clearly this is a lot of respect, and love for a man who we know only as a close friend and a companion. However, I am not aware of any sexual relations that he had with Hephaestion, supported by primary sources. But, in my opinion, it is very likely that Alexander III did have homosexual relationships, purely because that was the cultural norm of the time, but not necessarily with Hephaestion.',\n",
       " \"To understand the causes of the 1962 coup, we have to go back a bit further to the past. In 1948, three years after the end of WW2, Burma got its independence from the UK. From the onset Burma was to be an unstable nation : in 1947, Aung San, Aung San Suu Kyi’s father and the leader who pushed for independence, was assassinated by a rival politician. The Burmese State had to deal with ethnic conflict, two communist rebellions, and even a Chinese nationalist incursion, with KMT troops occupying parts of the Shan State and trading drugs in the region. Despite these issues, between 1948 and 1962, Burma was a parliamentary democracy ruled by a civilian government. It had an independent judiciary system, more independent than any government since then. Its constitution was written by 15 Burmese scholars educated in the UK and in theory gave a voice to the minorities living the country. Elections were seen as fair, at least in the regions without any insurgency. In 1947, U Nu, a devout Buddhist, was elected as the first Prime Minister of Burma. His party, the AFPFL (Anti-Fascist People’s Freedom League) was the largest in the country. It was a large confederation of mostly centre-left parties which adhered in varying degrees to socialism. The party won a large majority of the seats in parliament during the 1947, 1952 and 1956 elections. Inside however the party was quite divided among individual loyalty ties, many individuals in the party had their personal power base, and even their own armed supporters. These tensions led to a split in April 1958, one camp became known as the Clean AFPFL and the other as the Stable AFPFL. They both tried to claim the heritage of the former party. An election was planned for late 1958. However, as we just saw tensions between the political factions were very high, to the point were civil war was feared, as many politicians were ready to fight to become Prime Minister. At the same time, the communist groups had not been subdued, ethnic rebellions were progressing in the provinces, and Karen rebels even got as far as the outskirts of Rangoon. Since it joined the allies in later parts of WW2 and participated in the fight for independence , the Burmese military was seen as a honourable institution. A career in the military was considered enviable and higher ups in the military were part of the elite of the country. The military also had experience administrating territories that were under threat from ethnic rebellions or Chinese Nationalists. Seeing the potential chaos and violence that would result from the 1958 election, Ne Win, the leader of the military, decided to stage a coup. U Nu, who was still Prime Minister at the time decided to legitimise the coup, though it is not clear to what extent he was coerced to do so. The rule of the caretaker military government was seen as efficient : they reached decisions quickly, were not corrupt, instituted law and order, cleaned the cities and created some successful businesses linked to the military. This period gave great confidence to the military, as they saw themselves as more competent than the civilian government. However, during this period, there were signs of what was to come : the military imprisoned journalists who criticised its actions, and members of the military took the role of civil servants. While he originally only intended to govern for six months, Ne Win extended his own term twice and stayed 18 months in power, after which the military withdrew and allowed a free election that brought U Nu back into power. Ne Win was also disappointed by the results of this election : he had given his blessing to the candidates of the Stable AFPFL, who lost to U Nu, the leader of the Clean AFPFL. U Nu, after his re-election in 1960, instead of trying to stabilise the country, decided to make Buddhism the State religion of Burma, which caused a lot of anger and led to the Christian Kachin to take arms against the government. Despite this, U Nu also promised to discuss federalism and minority rights with ethnic leaders. The military, having tasted power during the caretaker government and finding itself at odds with U Nu’s decisions, decided to stage another coup. Ne Win, the leader of the military, legitimately or not, feared that U Nu’s promises could break up the country. On March 2, 1962, Ne Win launched the coup, during which two people were killed, and took over the government. The official reason was to preserve the unity of the country and avoid chaos. This time, the military dismantled civilian institutions and arrested anyone who could threaten their rule. Students were massacred for protesting against the new regime. Ne Win created the BSPP (Burmese Socialist Programme Party) and published a manifesto in April 1962. While it adopted some socialist policies, it also rejected Marxism and was infused by nationalist ideology and Buddhism. Ne Win's rule was simply disastrous and turned Burma from the breadbasket of the region to one of the poorest countries in the world. Unfortunately the reactions of the USA and USSR to this coup are unknown to me (and not mentioned in the sources I used). This new military regime was mostly neutral during the Cold War and was not pro-Soviet or pro-American. It preferred isolationism and was quite xenophobic but had some ties to the nonaligned movement. Sources : Burma, What Everyone Needs to Know by David I.

       " \"For long-distance transport across oceans, oil (as well as petrol and related products) was generally carried in tankers. These were precursors to the supertankers of today. They had large tanks, which oil could be pumped into or out of. There were massive variances between tankers; some ships were small, old and slow, while more modern ships were faster and had a much larger capacity. The Royal Fleet Auxiliary operated several groups of commercially built tankers as the 'Dale' class, to carry fuel between ports and naval bases. They are generally representative of modern civilian tankers at the time. The first 'Dale' class ships were produced by the British Tanker Company to a standard design called the 'three twelves'. These ships had a cruising speed of 12 knots, burned 12 tons of diesel fuel a day to make that speed, and carried 12,000 tons of cargo. They had a long range, of ~20,000 nautical miles. The next two ships were produced by the Shell company. They had similar performance to the BTC ships. They carried slightly less fuel, but this was because two of their tanks were on a separate system to allow them to be dedicated to the carriage of petrol. The last seven ships of the class were built to the standard Ministry of War Transport 'Empire' tanker design. These were similar to the two preceeding groups in size and performace, though some ships used steam engines rather than diesel. Oil was carried within the UK was carried in a variety of means. Most fuel and oil arrived in the main west coast ports of Glasgow, Liverpool and Bristol. From here, it could take a variety of routes to the final consumers. Oil distribution was the responsibility of the Petroleum Board, a conglomeration of the major oil companies. If the oil needed to end up near the coast, it would usually be carried in a coastal tanker. These were smaller, slower or older tankers, but otherwise worked the same way as their larger oceanic cousins. Some oil was carried in tank barges along Britain's canal network. Rail carried a significant proportion of fuel being carried to destinations inland. These used a mix of purpose-built tank wagons and ordinary box vans carrying fuel in tins or barrels. The former were used to carry fuel or oil from the ports to depots, supply dumps and civilian locations fitted with the necessary pumps. Box vans were used for carrying fuel to consumers which did not have pumps available. Road tankers were also used. These were smaller and less efficient than coastal tankers or rail, and so were only used over short distances, or where these methods were not practical. The UK did not enter the war with a pipeline network in place. However, the closure of the East Coast ports due to German bombing, the U-boat threat and threats from motor torpedo boats to shipping on routes along the east coast resulted in a mass of tanker traffic heading into the west coast ports. This threatened to overload the existing systems of distribution - there wasn't enough space on the railways or roads to take the fuel and oil away from the west coast ports. To ensure an efficient flow of fuel, a pipeline network, the Government Pipeline Storage System, was constructed. This started with a ~100 mile pipeline linking Bristol to London, built in June-November 1941. The system rapidly grew from this beginning, linking Bristol, Liverpool, London, rural fuel storage dumps, the major naval bases of the south coast and the air bases in the east of the country. In its ultimate form, it had a loop around much of England, with branches running off to the ports, storage sites and bases.\",\n",
       " 'The Afghan war did not cause a pronounced political reaction among ordinary Soviet citizens: with poor knowledge of the situation, lack of understanding and fear prevailed. The relatives of the men of military age were particularly concerned that they might be sent to Afghanistan. For a large part of the Soviet citizens, the cancellation of the deferment from military service to full-time university students was a blow. From year to year, the attitude to the war became more and more wary-negative. From the very beginning, Soviet dissidents opposed the war. For example an academician Sakharov in 1980 he was expelled from Moscow for public anti-war statement. At the same time, the amount of information presented in the Soviet media was clearly insufficient for an event of such scale and significance. The emphasis has always been on the word \"limited\" in reference to the Limited Contingent of Soviet Forces in Afghanistan. The authorities sought to minimize the submission of information about the tragic events and its dissemination. First of all, it concerned the farewell to the dead soldiers. Until 1987, zinc coffins with bodies were buried in semi-secret, and it was forbidden to indicate on the gravestones that a soldier had died in Afghanistan. By 1989, in connection with the policy of Glasnost, critical articles about the Soviet participation in this war began to appear in the press. At the Second Congress of People\\'s Deputies of the USSR in December 1989, a resolution was adopted declaring that the invasion of Afghanistan deserved political and moral condemnation.

       " 'I\\'m afraid the premise of the question is mistaken. No dictator, including JC, exceeded their appointed term. The traditional term was 6 months, and it stayed that way until Sulla became dictator in the aftermath of his civil war with Marius. Sulla asked to be appointed Dictator not for a specific term, but with a specific brief - dictator legibus faciendis et reipublicae constituendae causa (\"dictator for the making of laws and for the settling of the constitution\"). Presumably this office would have expired when the making of laws and settling the constitution was done. In fact, Sulla seems to have resigned this commission within 6 months, conforming to the traditional term. The office of the dictatorship wasn\\'t used again until 49, when JC held the dictatorship to conduct the elections for 48, since both consuls (who were on Pompey\\'s side) were absent from Rome. He held that office for only 11 days. He managed Rome in 48 only as consul. After Pharsalus, late that year, he was elected dictator again. The term of this dictatorship is unclear; we know he was dictator again in 47, but whether this is the same dictatorship or a 3rd has been disputed. Broughton, Roman Republican Magistrates, thinks it\\'s the 3rd based on some coins issued by Caesar in 47 that don\\'t carry the title dictator, if I understand his note correctly (It\\'s nearly 5 AM here and I haven\\'t been sleeping, so I may not have all my faculties working. Thank god my school is closed today). In April 46, Caesar was named dictator for ten years. That is a novel use of the office, but given Sulla\\'s precedent, seems entirely legal. Caesar\\'s final dictatorship is often called \"dictator for life\" but that\\'s wrong. Like Sulla\\'s, it came without a time limit but with a brief: Dictator Perpetuus - \"Dictator for as long as necessary.\" Presumably, as with Sulla\\'s office, this one would expire when it wasn\\'t necessary. Who decided whether it is necessary is an open question, and moot, since the Ides of March happened. The dictatorship was never used after Caesar. So bottom line: no Roman dictator exceeded their term of office, though the office did go through some revisions in the later years of the Republic.',\n",
       " \"The 'XXX' has rather mundane origins, as it is simply a marketing attempt made by a movie studio that used an already existing 'X' rating that was introduced by MPAA in 1968 to mark the movies that were considered unsuitable to minors, possibly based on the likewise named rating introduced in 1951 in United Kingdom (to be precise, it meant that customers under 16 were admitted under no circumstances). The first movie getting this rating was 'Vixen!' that premiered on 22nd October 1968 (some sources give this credit to a French movie 'The Girl on a Motorcycle', although it premiered in USA a month later). There was also one important difference between the 'X Rating' and three others (G, M and R) was that the former was not trademarked, meaning that anyone could market their movies as 'X-Rated', causing the rating differences between the high-quality movies, such as Midnight Cowboy or Last Tango in Paris and cheap pornographic flics to blur, which issue has been discussed by the National Association of Theatre Operators with MPAA as early as 1970. As erotic and pornographic movies were by definition not suitable for minors, and erotica was subjected to much stricter censorship in comparison to e.g. violence in Unites States, the 'X Rating' became generally associated with sexual content. This made the pornographic industry and 'X Rating' synonymous to some extent, especially since the late 1970s when many mainstream movies containing sex and violence scenes were either edited or toned down to secure the 'R' rating (also partially to avoid the aforementioned association with pornography). Of course, the pornographic film companies were all too eager to emphasize that their products are aimed on adult audience only, and thus started to multiply the 'X', suggesting even more graphic content as a way to attract customers. The first movie to be advertised this way was the 1969 picture Starlet, a poster for which contained the 'XXX' followed by a slogan So adult, one 'X' is not enough! which idea was quickly picked up bu others. Although one can sometimes find the explanation that the number of 'X' letters meant the type of the movie, with 'X' being erotica, 'XX' being graphically sexual and 'XXX' showing hardcore sexual scenes, this was never codified in any way by the pornographic industry and MPAA used only the single 'X'. In 1990, MPAA finally cancelled the 'X' rating replacing it with 'NC-17', cementing the association of 'X' with cinematic erotica and pornography. Thus, the modern usage of 'XXX' hails back to an advertisement of a 1969 movie, where it has been used as a pun referring to a recently introduced MPAA rating system. &#x200B; Bisen, C.S., Film Censorship: Regulating America's Screen, Wallflower Press, New York 2018\",\n",
       " 'The Jews in Palestine didn’t really seem to care one way or another - the rulers of the land had changed, but their own status didn’t, they were still a second-class population. There probably weren’t very many Jews in Palestine at the time anyway, although there was a larger Jewish population in Egypt, and in various parts of Europe too. The first targets of the First Crusade were actually the Jews of France and Germany. Some crusaders thought that if they were going to attack Muslims in far-away lands they had never seen before, why not attack the Jews closer to home? Weren’t Jews the enemies of Christianity too? The survivors of those attacks sent letters to the Jews of Egypt to warn them of what was coming. Once the crusaders arrived ta Jerusalem in 1099, anyone who was still inside when they captured it was massacred along with the rest of the population, whether they were Muslims, Jews, or even eastern Christians. The city was depopulated and non-Latin Christians were not allowed to live there, at least for the first few years. But the crusaders apparently also took a lot of hostages - not just people, but books and other valuable items as well. Jewish sources don’t really mention the crusade as a specific event, but the aftermath was a major concern for them. They needed to raise money to ransom their friends and relatives who had been taken captive or enslaved. One famous source is the “Letter of the Karate elders” from Ashkelon, which happened to be preserved in the Cairo Geniza along with many other similar documents. They were trying to ransom captive Jews, or they were lamenting those who had died or had gone missing. Over the years a small Jewish population seems to have returned to Jerusalem and other cities captured by the crusaders. Correspondence between European and Egyptian Jews show that there was still an active intellectual community in Acre. The great scholar Maimonides also lived during the crusader period, although he lived in Egypt and not under direct crusader rule. Jewish pilgrims from Europe like Benjamin of Tudela or Petachiah of Regensburg also visited the crusader kingdom. Benjamin notes how many Jews he encountered in each city and what their occupations were. He also mentions that the crusaders had modified some of the pilgrimage sites to make them more accessible to Christian pilgrims, such as the Cave of the Patriarchs at Hebron. But for a small fee, Jewish pilgrims could access the “real” site. Benjamin and Petachiah and the documents from the Cairo Genizah don’t mention the crusaders as a distinct group, they’re just another group in the long line of conquerors who ruled the land. It didn’t matter to the Jews at the time - they had no country of their own and they didn’t expect to rule Jerusalem themselves. They lived whether they were welcome. Sometimes they refer to the the crusaders indirectly but they call them \"Franks\" (which is also what the crusaders called themselves, and what Greeks, eastern Christians, and Muslims called them). Otherwise they call them “the uncircumcised”, or they use Biblical allusions, such as “the sons of Edom”. From the other perspective, the crusaders were aware of their Jewish subjects, but they didn’t know about (or care about) the various different Jewish sects. As mentioned, there were Karaites, who used only the Torah and rejected the Talmud, although most of the Jews were Rabbinic Jews who did use the Talmud. In Nablus, there were also Samaritans, who had their own version of the Torah. The crusaders recognize the Samaritans as a separate group, presumably because of the “Good Samaritan” story in the Gospels. (I always imagine crusaders arriving in the Near East and being shocked to discover that Samaritans were real, not just characters from a story.) Jews (and Samaritans) were recognized in crusader legal texts as one of the various “minority” populations, i.e. the social minorities, including all the Muslim and eastern Christian populations, which were actually the numerical majority compared to the crusader ruling class (although the Jews and Samaritans were a numerical minority too). They had a few legal rights but not as much as the European crusaders did. For example they weren’t allowed to testify in court, unless they were testifying against another Jewish person or another minority (i.e. not against a Latin Christian). In those cases, they were allowed to swear oaths on their own Torah in Hebrew. They were also allowed to be merchants in the cities, and they were allowed to be doctors too. The kings of Jerusalem often had Jewish, Muslim, and eastern Christian doctors. There were already well-trained doctors there, so no need to import doctors from Europe. The Latin church of course insisted that only Latin Christians could be doctors for Latin Catholic kings, and whenever a king died there were always rumours that he had been poisoned by untrustworthy easterners. But eastern doctors were quite common. So for the Jews in Palestine and Egypt, there was some brief disruption after the First Crusade where the Jewish communities tried to ransom people and treasures. But otherwise the crusaders were just one more ruling class and things didn’t change much. Pilgrims still came to visit the holy sites, merchants continued to sell their goods, and doctors continued to practise. Things actually got much worse for the Jews in Europe, where they were often the first victims of any crusade.

       " \"German naval bases were attacked, from the second day of the war. Not by the Fleet Air Arm initially; aircraft carriers mounted anti-submarine patrols as the war started but the loss of Courageous to a U-boat on September 17th 1939 and submarine and air attacks on Ark Royal in that month demonstrated the dangers of operating around the UK. It was the RAF's Bomber Command that raided Wilhelmshaven. Strictly speaking, it wasn't the naval base that was attacked, it was ships in the harbour; there were great concerns over potential civilian casualties, especially after President Roosevelt urged restraint, to the point that Bomber Command were forbidden from attacking targets on German soil including ships alongside a dockyard wharf. This left few potential options for Bomber Command, so its activities for the first months of the war were restricted to dropping leaflets by night, and searching for German ships in harbours or at sea by day. Bombers were dispatched on the first day of the war, September 3rd 1939, but failed to find targets; the following day 15 Blenheims and 14 Wellingtons took off to attack ships in Wilhelmshaven harbour and off Brunsbüttel at the mouth of the Kiel Canal. The results demonstrated how poorly prepared Bomber Command were; five Blenheims and two Wellingtons were shot down for negligible results. Admiral Scheer was hit by three bombs that failed to explode, the only damage done to shipping was by a Blenheim that crashed into Emden. The town of Esbjerg in Denmark was hit by two bombs intended for Brunsbüttel, 110 miles away. Over the following months many sorties were flown searching for German shipping, seldom finding much less successfully attacking anything. On December 14th 1939 five Wellingtons were shot down near Wilhemshaven; on December 18th a further 12 Wellingtons were lost in The Battle of Heligoland Bight, after which the RAF restricted daylight operations over Germany, searching for shipping in the North Sea (with little success) and mounting harassing patrols around seaplane bases. As the war developed Bomber Command continued intermittent attacks on naval bases joined by the US Army Air Force from 1943 (the Fleet Air Arm tended to operate further afield, such as its extremely successful attack on the Italian naval base of Taranto, though also mounted several raids on the battleship Tirpitz in Norway). Following the invasion of France ports such as Brest, Lorient, and Saint-Nazaire became important bases, as well as sites in Germany and Norway. Results varied, with bases seldom being put entirely out of action, but ships and facilities were frequently damaged (such as the battlecruiser Gneisenau, damaged several times by air attack from March 1941 to February 1942 to the point that it was ultimately decommissioned). To protect the U-boats colossal concrete bunkers were constructed, and were largely impervious to bombs until the massive Tallboy and Grand Slam bombs were deployed in 1944.\",\n",
       " 'The British bombed German naval bases many times. The great majority of the attacks were by Bomber Command (i.e., by land-based bombers), but some attacks used aircraft carriers. Britain entered WWII with shipping and naval bases as the only targets for its bombers. At the start of WWII, President Roosevelt (of the still-neutral USA) asked the combatants to restrain themselves from bombing civilian targets, and Britain, France, and Germany all agreed. British bombers could reach most of Germany from their bases in Britain, but couldn\\'t reach eastern Germany and therefore couldn\\'t direct support Poland in their defence against the German invasion. Unwillingness to violate the neutral airspace of Belgium and the Netherlands effectively removed some targets. Bomber Command initially treated possible collateral damage to civilian targets with great caution, and decided not to bomb any targets with too great a risk of civilian casualties. This left naval bases in western Germany and German military shipping as their targets - shipping could be attacked at sea with no civilian risk, and naval bases could be attacked with minimal chance of hitting civilian areas (provided the bombers flew appropriate bomb runs, where short or long bombs would hit the coast rather than the city). Bomber Command would fly over other targets, but dropping propaganda leaflets rather than bombs. This would continue to the end of the \"Phony War\", the quiet period between the defeat of Poland and the German attack in the west (the specific trigger for the change of policy was the German bombing of Rotterdam, with about 1,000 civilian deaths (fewer than the 30,000 claimed by contemporary propaganda, but still many)). The problem with this shipping-and-bases bombing policy was that level bombers found it difficult to hit ships at sea, and German naval bases in the west, well-known to be within range of British bombers, had the best air defences available at the time (anti-aircraft guns, fighter bases, and radar). From September through to mid-December 1939, Bomber Command attempted to bomb German naval bases, especially Wilhelmshaven. These raids inflicted very little damage (Admiral Scheer was hit by three bombs, none of which exploded, and Emden was hit by a crashing Blenheim, which caused minor damage), and many suffered losses of over half of the attacking bombers. The British bomber from higher altitudes, trying get above the ceiling of German anti-aircraft fire, but losses were still heavy. Meanwhile, night raids (dropping leaflets) took very few losses, and Bomber Command switched to a policy of night bombing. The British continued to bomb naval bases, but at night. With the fall of France, and the establishment of German naval bases on the French coast (notably Brest, Lorient, and Saint Nazaire, which contained major U-boat bases, and Brest was home to German heavy surface ships), the British bombed those bases, too. When the US entered the war, they also bombed these bases in France. Hundreds of raids flew against these targets, and Lorient and Saint Nazaire were largely destroyed (with relatively few civilian casualties, since the cities were largely evacuated before destruction), and La Pallice (by La Rochelle), Brest and Bordeaux were damaged. The U-boat pens were largely unharmed, as they were heavily protected by thick ferroconcrete armour, designed to be bomb-proof. German surface ships didn\\'t fare so well: Scharnhorst was hit by five bombs in a raid on La Pallice on 24th July 1941; she was the star attraction that had brought the raid. Gneisenau, in Brest, was attacked many times, and was hit by a torpedo (dropped by a land-based torpedo bomber) on 6th April 1941, and by four bombs on 9th April. These continuing attacks motivated the dangerous \"Channel Dash\" (Operation Cerberus) of February 1942, to get these ships to safer bases in Germany. These naval bases were poor targets for carrier attacks. The U-boat pens were immune to anything that carrier aircraft could drop on them, and raids would be small, against heavy AAA and fighter defences, and expose the carriers to dangerous German land-based air. British carriers did attack less-protected German naval bases, especially in Norway. German battleships were high-priority targets, and Tirpitz had been attacked 6 times by Bomber Command while in Wilhelmshaven and Kiel (to no effect), and attacks continued after she moved to bases in Norway. Tirpitz was attacked by Bomber Command 7 times while in Norwegian ports, the 3rd last attack causing major damage, and the last attack sinking her. There was also one attack by the Soviet air force, and two by midget submarines and manned torpedoes, and 5 attacks launched by carriers (two of which caused minor damage). Some other carrier strikes were attempted, but were cancelled due to bad weather. Other Norwegian ports were attacked, seeking lesser prey. British carriers ranged as far as the Arctic coast of Finland, on 30th July 1941, when Kirkenes (in northern Norway) and Petsamo (in Finland) were attacked, sinking one ship and damaging another (there were few targets in the ports). British carriers earned their fame for attacks on naval bases against Italy, in the raid on Taranto, 11th November 1940. Three of the 6 Italian battleships were put out of action for some time. Ports in North Africa were attacked, too. Benghazi and Tripoli were raided, and carrier aircraft dropped flares and spotted for a battleship bombardment of Tripoli. British carriers would raid Japanese naval bases later in the war, too. A German naval base was the target of the earliest known naval air raid, when a Japanese seaplane, based on the seaplane carrier Wakamiya, attacked the German naval base at Qingdao (Tsingtao), on 6th September 1914. The plane attacked the Austro-Hungarian cruiser Kaiserin Elisabeth, and a German gunboat. The bombs were dropped by hand, and missed. This attack, in the infancy of naval air power, was unsuccessful. Just over a quarter-century later, Taranto and Pearl Harbor would demonstrate what carrier power could do.',\n",
       " \"/u/Bigglesworth_ and /u/wotan_weevil have described the RAF's attacks on German ports. However, they have not fully explaned why the Royal Navy did not use its carriers to attack ports within Germany. The Royal Navy had long appreciated the ability of aircraft to strike against German harbours. Officers of the Royal Naval Air Service had first suggested the use of aircraft to attack an enemy fleet in harbour in 1911. In 1912, a Lieutenant Hyde-Thomson wrote a paper describing the possibility of attacking targets with torpedo-carrying aircraft; he was soon sent to the Torpedo School in Portsmouth, to develop a torpedo that could be carried by an aircraft. This effort ultimately led to the development of the first carrier torpedo bomber, the Sopwith Cuckoo. Over the course of 1916-17, plans were developed for a strike against the German fleet using Cuckoos carried into position by a large fleet of carriers. This plan was overambitious, but the idea remained in place. Had the war continued into 1919, the German fleet would have been attacked by aircraft flying from the carriers Argus, Furious and Vindictive. While this attack never took place, the Fleet Air Arm continued to see attacks against enemy fleets in harbour as a key part of its mission. These strikes were often practiced in the interwar period, and plans were drawn up for them. The most famous of these was the plan for an attack on the Italian fleet base at Taranto, drawn up by the captain of Glorious in 1935 (and updated in 1938). However, despite this precedent, there was no attack on elements of the German fleet in German ports by FAA aircraft. /u/Bigglesworth_ suggests that this was because the loss of Courageous in September 1939 led to the RN being more cautious with its carriers in the waters around the UK. However, I would disagree. Courageous was sunk in the Western Approaches, not the North Sea; in other words, on the wrong side of the UK. The RN was aware of the risks it took by deploying its carrier fleet on anti-submarine patrols, and was willing to take and suffer losses to it. British carriers continued to operate in the North Sea up until the fall of Norway. As an example, Ark Royal joined an operation by Home Fleet to support the damaged submarine Spearfish as it returned to the UK. This involved a deployment to the southern part of the North Sea. The loss of Courageous did, however, have a more indirect effect. Without her, the RN did not have enough carriers to carry out all the missions demanded of it, and to make an attack on German ports. The RN had to hunt German raiders, defend British interests in the Mediterranean and Far East, cover the Home Fleet against air attack and provide ships for training new pilots. After the loss of Courageous, the RN had six carriers available. Furious was undergoing a major refit and was unavailable. Argus was in the Mediterranean, training new pilots in deck-landings. Glorious was hunting raiders in the Indian Ocean. Hermes and Eagle were also hunting raiders, this time in the Atlantic; Ark Royal spent some time on this duty, some time with Home Fleet and some time in the Mediterranean. There was no carrier free to make an effective strike on German ports. Another factor was the FAA's aircraft procurement policy. In the interwar period, British doctrine held that carrier aircraft would not be used against land-based aircraft. Carriers would fight other carriers or attack unprotected battleships at sea. This meant that carrier aircraft did not have to have comparable performance to those based on land. They could instead focus on the low-speed handling and strength that was useful for repeated landings on carriers. Fighters could carry two-man crews and have limited speed; the former allowed easier navigation, the latter was because the fighters would only have to fight low-performance carrier aircraft. The war showed this doctrine to be fatally flawed; there was no way for a carrier to avoid fighting land-based aircraft. To attack a German port, the strike aircraft might be attacked by high-performance fighters, while the fleet would be exposed to attack by bombers that could outrun its fighters. This was a high risk that the RN was unwilling to take; a strike against a German port could well end with heavy losses to the strike force and to the fleet that launched it. This risk could be avoided by making a surprise attack, as with the Taranto strike. However, this was harder to do in the North Sea than in the Mediterranean. There was much less sea room for a fleet to make deceptive manouvres. British bases were closer to Germany, and therefore much easier for the Germans to surveil. There were more German reconnaissance aircraft and submarines that might spot a fleet trying to approach the German coast. It was much simpler to allow the RAF to use its high-performance land-based aircraft to attack German ports. These could attack at less risk due to their higher performance and the difficulty the Germans had with attacking British air bases. RAF Bomber Command could, for much of the war, make attacks with much more aircraft than the RN could, increasing the chance of a successful attack. Finally, there was a lack of targets that could be effectively attacked for much of the war. The German capital ships, the most valuable targets and those that were easiest to attack, spent a lot of time under repair, in the Baltic (which the FAA could not effectively reach) or out at sea. Ships out at sea could obviously not be attacked in harbour, while ships in drydock for repairs could not be targeted by torpedoes, the RN's main anti-ship weapon. The German large cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau made their first sortie in November 1939, but suffered significant damage from wind and wave. Following this, they required repair and refit, which was followed by a trip to the Baltic for training. In April, they participated in the German invasion of Norway. Here, they took damage from British shells, mines and torpedoes, as well as some damage from the weather. Repairs put the ships out of action until the start of 1941, when they sortied for Operation Berlin, a raid into the North Atlantic. Operation Berlin ended in March 1941, when the two ships put into the French port of Brest. Here, they would be the target of frequent strikes from the RAF. Damage done by these strikes put them in and out of drydocks until they returned to Germany in the Channel Dash. Both ships struck mines during the voyage; Gneisenau would be destroyed by RAF bombers while repairing from this mine strike. After a prolonged series of repairs, Scharnhorst headed north to Norway, where she would be sunk off the North Cape by the British battleship Duke of York. Bismarck completed in August 1940, and spent the next eight months on sea trials in the Baltic. In May 1941, she would sortie from the Baltic into the Atlantic, and did not return. Her sister, Tirpitz, carried out sea trials in the Baltic, before heading to Norway. Here, she would be the target of a number of Fleet Air Arm strikes during 1944.

       " 'I) Relatively accurate all things considered. That\\'s not to say that he\\'s spot on or even remotely modern. Like the \"fathers\" of many academic disciplines, Herodotus was woefully insufficient by modern standards, but he was also the first person with surviving work who attempted to gather different accounts from primary sources into one concise narrative. He reported many stories uncritically, like the supposed gold digging ants in India, but also presented multiple versions of stories he considered equally plausible to his audience with a disclaimer of which he preferred, like the different stories of Cambyses\\' motivation to invade Egypt. He was also probably not writing history in the same way that historians write today, or even the way Thucydides wrote a generation later. Herodotus was probably writing for the sake of public performance at least as much as he was writing for written circulation. As a result he tended to embrace drama and play into public perception. This is most evident in his stories about Darius and Xerxes, where he plays up the power of women at court and expends detail into the court drama of figures like Bardiya (who he calls Smerdis), Masistes, and Atossa. As a result of some of these tendencies, Herodotus has faced aggressive criticism since antiquity. Plutarch was the one who coined the infamous \"Father of Lies\" title for Herodotus, which has dogged his legacy ever since. At the same time, modern historians and archaeologists routinely vindicate him. The translation of the Behistun Inscription validated the basic outline of his seemingly absurd story of Darius\\' rise to power. In 2019, a ship design previously thought to be fabricated by Herodotus was found in the Nile which also helps verify his claims about traveling to Egypt more generally. Even the bizarre claim about gold digging ants has recently been speculated to be the garbled story of Indian gold miners following marmots Ultimately, Herodotus is a mixed bag, but he\\'s also our only real source for many, many events. A lot of other ancient sources for the same events are later and use Herodotus as one of their main sources. It\\'s one of the reasons his Histories have survived as well as they have. He also probably used other known sources that are otherwise lost, which we have no reason to cast doubt on. This includes work from the likes of Heraclitus of Miletus, Skylax of Caria, and Democedes of Croton. 2) Broadly speaking, he is considered an accurate source for the early Achaemenids. As I said before, he is also our only extant source for a lot of what he describes. He is considered better than some later Greek historians who discuss some of the same period, like Ctesias (who is only at all accurate for the events of his own life or the lives of people he could actually talk to) or Xenophon (whose Cyropaedia is just historical fiction). Still, he is the only detailed source for a lot of what he describes. He would have had access to primary accounts, especially for events in the western empire, and he would have met the actual participants of events he discusses, or at least their children and grandchildren for some earlier events. I referenced the Behistun Inscription and Herodotus\\' story of Darius the Great coming to power above. Herodotus\\' account is inline with Darius\\' proclamation and almost certainly used that proclamation as a source. His stories of Cambyses madness were probably based in related Persian propaganda issued to justify Darius\\' actions. However, Herodotus\\' story is also more detailed. In some cases that is probably the result of additional Persian sources we are not privy too, and in others it\\'s widely assumed that Herodotus was trying to form a logical explanation for the gaps in Darius\\' (highly doubtful story. Details like the false Smerdis (Persian Gaumata) being identical to Smerdis (Bardiya) appear to be Herodotus trying to make sense of the Behistun account events. Specifically in the case of Cyrus the Great, it goes one of two ways. Either it\\'s documented Anatolian history that Herodotus would definitely have had access to quality sources, or it\\'s relatively distant Mesopotamian and Iranian history where Herodotus was clearly reliant on hearsay. In the former case, we have the detailed account of Cyrus\\'s conquest of Lydia and the subsequent uprisings and suppression in Ionia. This was Herodotus\\' homeland, where he would have had ready access to both written and personal accounts of the events. The most extreme form of the latter can be seen in the stories of Cyrus\\'s upbringing, which are clearly propaganda based in the longstanding Near Eastern tradition of a great ruler raised by peasants (see Sargon of Akkad, Moses, etc). A sort of middle ground can be seen in the story of Cyrus\\' conquest of Media. Herodotus is broadly in line with the Babylonian account of the same events, but is more detailed and likely embellished. The same basic pattern plays out with his history of the Medes as well. Early events are almost entirely legendary, his understanding of the fall of Assyria is clearly muddled, and his account of the Battle of the Eclipse is generally accepted. 3) I don\\'t entirely understand this question. Herodotus was either largely ignorant of Judaism or at least considered Judea too minor a province to merit specific attention (which wouldn\\'t have been inaccurate). Herodotus lumps Judea into the larger region of Palestine (Παλαιστίνη), which Herodotus used to describe the region south of Phoenicia and northwest of Arabia, including Judea as well as neighboring areas like Idumea, Samaria, Moab, and the former Philistine Pentapolis. In his description of Xerxes army he lumps all of these people together as the \"Syrians of Palestine.\" Herodotus\\' account of the conquest of Babylon mostly falls into the \"clearly hearsay\" category. His account of a skirmish and a brief siege is probably more realistic than Cyrus\\'s claim of a completely peaceful conquest in the Cyrus Cylinder, but there is absolutely no evidence that Cyrus rerouted the Euphrates and sacked the city. It\\'s doubtful that this would even have been possible. The more likely explanation is that Herodotus had to fabricate a satisfying explanation for how the most famous city of the ancient Near East was conquered in lieu of a detailed understanding of the Babylonian political situation, which modern historians use to explain Cyrus\\'s easy victory. Nothing in Herodotus\\' account conflicts with Biblical narrative of Cyrus ending the exile, which is also considered a relatively reliable account of the period (assuming a secular historian strips away the aspects of divine intervention).',\n",
       " '1. I would say so. Moreso than \"father of lies\" which is just going far overboard with criticism. There are some aspects of his narrative that absolutely demand heavy scrutiny. I for one do not believe in any sense that Queen Artemissia was in any way involved with the Battle of Salamis (Eva Green\\'s character, if you have seen the 300 sequel), and that she was falsely inserted into the narrative due to being a compatriate of Herodotus. However, he was the first to do this. An inquiry into the events of the past, for an audience of the future. The preceding source we have is a play by Aeschylus, which, whilst an important source, is very different to an istoria. One thing to always keep in mind, is that though he may be writing for posterity, he cannot really imagine his audience as you and me. The audience in his head are literate Greeks. Now if you\\'re from modern, rural England, for example, and you want to watch a travel documentary, are you going to watch a series about someone travelling round Kent, and experiencing what marvels that region has to offer? Or would you rather watch some guy travel to the middle of Asia, consume local delicacies like snake blood and yak milk, and get into sticky situations regarding almost bizarre foreign customs? It\\'ll be the latter. There are similarities among humans the world over, but since Herodotus was arguably writing a travel book, it is the oddities that are focused on. I don\\'t think his entire book, much like the Christian bible, can be boiled down to \"accurate\" or \"false\" as a single entity. It\\'s a fairly large volume really, and should always be read with its extensive editor\\'s/translator\\'s notes.',\n",
       " 'To understand the transition, we must first try to figure out why two-syllable given names were rare prior to and during Three Kingdoms. I will attempt to look at it more closely from right before Three Kingdoms, which is the two Han dynasties. According to a study ( 单双名问题考察 ), in Records of the Three Kingdoms 99% of names mentioned were of one syllable. In Book of the Later Han the Eastern Han dynasty, it\\'s at 98%. In Book of Han for the Western Han dynasty, it\\'s at 77%. While we need to take this with a pinch of salt as names cited in historic records were mostly famous people and those of higher status, which is not representative of the whole wider population , the dominance still clearly points to a preference of one-syllable names. There were 2 main reasons why one-syllable name was preferred. Naming taboo Known as 避讳, this has become very crucial and important since the rise of Confucianism. In summary, when one 避讳, one has to change his name to make sure that the character(s) used are not the same as that person they are trying to 避讳 (eg. the emperor) Comparatively, one-syllable names are easier to do so because well, others only have to change one word to 避讳. Hence two-syllable names are said to be \" 为其难讳也 \"《十三经注疏·春秋公羊传注疏 》, i.e. hard to 避讳. As such, one-syllable name was preferred. Wang Mang When he was in power, he proposed that \" 令中国不得有二名 \" 《汉书·匈奴传下》. I.e. China should not have (people with) two-syllable names. He supported his claim with \"讥二名，二名非礼也 \" from the same source as the above point 《十三经注疏·春秋公羊传注疏》, which is a Confucian classic. Technically, there were various interpretations of this quote, but Mang simply took the interpretation that fit his proposal more, which is that two-syllable names were indecent, impolite. He also acted on his proposal and ordered the change of his eldest grandson from a one-syllable name back to his original two-syllable name, as a shaming and punishment for his despicable attempt to take over the throne. This is cited here 宗本名会宗，以制作去二名，今复名会宗。贬厥爵，改厥号，赐諡为功崇缪伯，以诸伯之礼葬于故同谷城郡。《 汉书·王莽传下》 Because of this incident, no one (at least amongst the upper class) dared to use two-syllable names when Mang was in power/the emperor. This also has lasting influences into the Eastern Han dynasty that followed, as nobody wanted to be associated with a traitor / someone who was publicly shamed. This could also be why we see the proportion of one-syllable names rose from 77% to 98% in Eastern Han as per what I mentioned earlier. Now onto why a specific rise during Jin /4th Century The reign of Jin dynasty was one that\\'s short lived and turbulent. In the 4th Century, Invasion and rebellion of the Five Barbarians occurred. This influx and invasion of nomadic \\'barbarians\\' brought havoc and destruction to the middle kingdom, and along with that, displacement or destruction of the original Chinese culture with introduction of their own culture. This was cited to be unprecedented destruction of the traditional ritual and cultural system 宪章礼乐，寂灭无闻 《隋书·牛弘传》 This cultural \\'disaster\\' brought 2 changes. First, people were no longer so fixated on certain traditional aspects, in this case, the preference for one-syllable names. Second, the introduction of nomadic people and their culture also brought along many new two-syllable names, as many of these people chose to retain their original, two-syllable names. The combined effects of these 2 changes brought about more acceptance of two-syllable names and more appearance in historical records (as the nomadic people were very active in this period). Religious influences. During the Jin, a group of people known as the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove to be popular and highly-regarded for their somewhat eccentric lifestyle and writings. These people were Taoists and disliked the Sima Clan (ruling family of Jin) and their rules. They preached \"越名教而任自然\" , essentially promoting a lifestyle away from the hypocritical \\'etiquette\\' system of Confucianism, to simply be free and equal in all things in life. This somewhat Taoist concept, as well as the introduction of Buddhism , cause people to start using what is called \\'虚字\\' (virtual words) in their names to convey some sort of religious, spiritual meanings. Some of the more common ones are 之、道、昙、僧、灵 , all of them with some sort of religious implications. Wang clan of Langya Wang Xizhi and his sons are a good example, all of them used 之 These \\'virtual words\\' also has the benefit of not being restricted by the aforementioned naming taboo. 晋王羲之子知名者五人：曰玄之、凝之、徽之、操之、献之。徽之子桢之，献之嗣子静之。祖孙父子，皆以‘之’为名，不以为嫌也。宋王弘子僧达，孙僧亮、僧衍，从子僧详、僧绛、僧虔，从孙僧祐，叔侄皆以‘僧’为名，不以为嫌也。 《 史讳举例 》 As these words serve no practical function and are just religious \\'decorations\\' to one\\'s names, they are not controlled by the rules of naming taboo. As time past, people also began to realize that this additional \\'virtual word\\' can also be a way for them to express well-wishes and blessings. For example 初，豁闻苻坚国中有谣云：‘谁谓尔坚石打碎。’有子二十人，皆以‘石’为名以应之。唯石虔、石秀、石民、石生、石绥、石康知名《晋书·桓彝传附子豁传》 The Jin general Huan Huo after hearing the rumor that the enemy, Fu Jian kingdom can only be destroyed by stones, promptly named all of his sons with the \\'virtual word\\' 石 (stone) to fit this rumor and express his desire to defeat his enemy. From then on, people began to slowly adopt more words that are not so religious into their names to form two-syllable names with embedded meanings of well-wishes and ideals. Hence, due to the changes brought about by religious influences and cultural shifts, from here on, two-syllable names became popular. On a side note, as the population of China rose later on, there emerged more reasons and needs for two-syllable names , particularly during Tang and Song dynasties. But because they are not around the 4th Century period, they are not within the scope here. Sources 《单名与双名：汉晋南方人名的变迁及其意义》 魏斌 《单双名问题考察》张书岩 《唐人姓名研究》 闫廷亮',\n",
       " 'which divisions, unit, corps, etc. was in charge of running training ALL OF THEM, more or less. U.S. Army training was very decentralized. So in 1940, when the U.S. Army began preparing in a serious way for war, it started from a very small peacetime establishment. Consequently, the entire U.S. Army was one big training program from 1940-42 and even while small numbers of U.S. Army divisions were fighting between late \\'42 and D-Day in 1944, most divisions were not in combat and still completing their training program. Since the Army was focused on training, ultimately it\\'s General Headquarters (GHQ) which was later renamed to Army Ground Forces, was in command of the training program. As GHQ/AGF commander, Leslie J. McNair was the officer most responsible for the training and mobilization plans of the U.S. Army. He designed a training and mobilization scheme in which individual combat units were responsible for training their own personnel. The way this process worked is that enlistees or draftees were assigned directly to their division. Each new division started with a cadre, a group of more experienced officers and men who were responsible for training the new recruits, all the way from basic training up to battalion and division level maneuvers. However, once a division was making progress in becoming trained, it often became subject to personnel raids, especially for Cadre for new divisions and occasionally for trained men to send to divisions already in combat as replacements. Men were then promoted to fill the gaps and newer draftees were added to replace them and the training cycle would begin again to bring them up to speed. This process in it\\'s early phases, 1940-3, rather resembled cell division. Later in the war, when all the divisions were activated there were more specialized programs for training replacements, and the last divisions to see combat frequently trained very large numbers of men as replacements for the older divisions already in combat. As more and more divisions entered combat, they began to need replacements for casualties suffered. These men were sometimes trained under the Replacement and School Command setup in 1942. However this organization was initially not up to the task of training the replacements needed and they were often stripped out from newer combat units instead. Only later in the war did a well organized replacement training system with the infamous \"Repple Depots\", Replacement Depots begin to emerge.',\n",
       " 'This question piqued my interest, so I went to see if the official Czechoslovak Communist newspaper Rudé právo had anything to say about Jonestown. In short: Rudé právo wrote about both Jim Jones and his followers in mostly negative terms, continually referring to the members of the People\\'s Temple as \"religious fanatics.\" They did not describe them as possible comrades, but as misguided victims looking for an escape from a cruel capitalist system. The most specific reference I could find to the group\\'s political orientation was one line where Jones was described as having \"participated in the Maoist movement.\" (The Czechoslovak regime was no fan of Mao, naturally.) There was no coverage of the People\\'s Temple or Jonestown until after the massacre. On November 21, it published an article titled \"Mass suicide of religious fanatics\". It provided the basic facts of Congressman Ryan\\'s visit to Guyana and the subsequent mass murder/suicide, but also connected it to the murder of Sharon Tate, editorializing that young Americans were joining fanatical cults en masse as an escape from the alienating American way of life, characterized by the mindless pursuit of material gain. In articles over the following days, it emphasized the US government\\'s responsibility for Jonestown: one article explained that Walter Mondale and other leading US political figures had assisted the People\\'s Temple diplomatically in their relocation to South America, others said that the State Department had been informed of the conditions at Jonestown and preparations for the massacre and chose not to intervene, others speculated that the assassinations of George Moscone and Harvey Milk might be related to the People\\'s Temple and reported allegations, evidently being investigated by the FBI, that they had an assassination squad that planned to kill Jimmy Carter and kept millions of dollars in a Swiss bank account. On December 12, it published photographs from the massacre, describing the dead at Jonestown as \"victims of a social system characterized by racism and its extreme, the Ku Klux Klan, characterized by drug abuse, corruption and all-powerful gangsterism, a system of man\\'s hatred toward man,\" and seekers of economic, social, and racial justice who \"sought an impossible and utopian solution, and became victims of a murderer.\" This was accompanied by a picture of First Lady Rosalynn Carter with Jim Jones and a reproduction of a polite letter she sent him in 1977. These articles are absolutely typical of the way Rudé právo described the United States at this time -- as a place of extreme injustice, exploitation, corruption, crime, danger, and overall chaos. This simultaneously evokes very old European stereotypes about American society and provides a clear contrast with what the Czechoslovak regime presented itself as offering its citizens during the period of late socialism -- the opportunity for all to live a normal, peaceful, quiet, relatively comfortable life. However, in July 1981, Rudé právo reported allegations by Joe Holsinger that the CIA was responsible for the deaths at Jonestown. According to this article, the People\\'s Temple followers hadn\\'t just committed suicide or fallen victim to a crazed religious fanatic, they were subjected to experimentation through the MKULTRA program, which continued in secret. CIA agents at Jonestown were using various drugs and psychological tactics to brainwash the people there, but the experiment got out of control and the subjects had to be murdered. One month before, they had published speculations that both Jonestown and drug use in the United States were related to CIA experiments, and implied the US supported the mujahideen in Afghanistan to keep Americans addicted to heroin. The July article about Jonestown actually appeared on the front page, which no articles on Jonestown published in 1979 had, and it\\'s the last mention of the People\\'s Temple that I could find. It\\'s very interesting, since none of the articles written in 1979 imply that the victims of the Jonestown massacre were brainwashed -- Rudé právo writers didn\\'t need an explanation beyond the cruelty and alienation of capitalism for why this happened.',\n",
       " \"This is a really interesting question, and right off the bat I'll tell you the answer: we don't know. But take a look at the following link: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Langs_N.Amer.png The link above is a linguistic map of North America. Remember that Middle Mississippians were primarily centered on the mid-portion of Mississippi, but also had strong influence on the Southeast, the Ohio River region, and into the Great Plains to an extent. We also know that the center of their culture appears to be Cahokia, which itself was home to people from many cultures. It was a city of immigrants, and they undoubtedly would have brought with them their own native tongues. We also have evidence that seems to indicate that whatever groups were behind the rise of Cahokia were able to convince the small communities living in what would become Cahokia to essentially cast aside everything to live in a manner we today associate with Middle Mississippians. We can see this in the archaeological record as well, previous groupings of homes are essentially torn down and rearranged to fit into what would become the larger grid used to layout Cahokia. So what does this have to do with anything? The rapid rise of Middle Mississippians and the multicultural nature of places like Cahokia make it really hard to link to one language or even a language family. We do not know which historic cultures are the descendants of Middle Mississippians, and while some maintained similar cultural expressions they are far from a tight cluster. Instead it seems that historic evidence that appears similar to how we think they lived in Middle Mississippian communities is not a direct link so much as it a wider, regional expression of culture that can be traced back to their influence. Linguistically the issue is that with the arrival of Europeans many cultures were upended or even wiped out, leaving behind a patchwork of languages. Referring back to the map I shared, an argument can potentially be made for something similar to a Siouan-Catawban langauge, with Caddoan and Muskogeon languages being options as well. The issues are that there exist some serious gaps in our understanding of the languages of North America as well as no clear descendants of Middle Mississippians. Unfortunately pot sherds and mica tablets do not talk, and so far we have yet to find any form of a written language that could help to give a glimpse at how they spoke in Mississippian communities.\",\n",

       " \"I can't give you a fully fledged analyses, but as a history student I have only ever heard of one guy who claimed something like this, Alexander of Abonoteichos. Alexander acted during the time of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius (161-180), so more the a half century after the 'classic' era. Alexander established an Oracle (like the famous one in Delphi) in his home town Abonoteichos where he predicted the future and healed sick people. There he convinced the people of the area that Greek god Apollo was about to be born again, in the form of a snake called Glycon. He then build a snake with a human hand as some sort of sock-puppet and spoke through her, convincing the people of her girls Nature. Alexander profited from the whole operation through increasing amounts of fame, influence and money. Also not everybody beliefert him, he was able to continue his practices until his death of old age. So he didn't claim himself being a descendant of a god, but it's kinda similar. This being the only example I know of, does not mean it did not happen much more often.

       " \"Moby Dick is inspired by the case of the whaleship Essex, a Nantucket whaleship that was sunk by a whale in 1820. Of the twenty man crew, seven died at sea and were cannibalized by the survivors. Ahab is a loose interpretation of Captain George Pollard Jr., who would go on to be a night watchman on Nantucket after sinking a second ship (in a more conventional way!), but this is more an effect of Pollard's position, not his personality. The first mate, Owen Chase, published the remarkable account the following year (after having been lost at sea 89 days). Chase's Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-Ship Essex explores how the crew responded to the incident and the decisions made at sea. He describes the whale strike: I observed a very large spermaceti whale, as well as I could judge, about eighty-five feet in length; he broke water about twenty rods off our weather-bow, and was lying quietly, with his head in a direction for the ship. He spouted two or three times, and then disappeared. In less than two or three seconds he came up again, about the length of the ship off, and made directly for us, at the rate of about three knots. The ship was then going with about the same velocity. His appearance and attitude gave us at first no alarm; but while I stood watching his movements, and observing him but a ship’s length off, coming down for us with great celerity...he came down upon us with full speed, and struck the ship with his head, just forward of the fore-chains; he gave us such an appalling and tremendous jar, as nearly threw us all on our faces. The ship brought up as suddenly and violently as if she had struck a rock... I could distinctly see him smite his jaws together, as if distracted with rage and fury. He remained a short time in this situation, and then started off with great velocity, across the bows of the ship, to windward...He struck her to windward, directly under the cathead, and completely stove in her bows... Owen's account, unsurprisingly, paints his actions positively. Thomas Nickerson, who was just 14, wrote an account at the end of his life that examines the conflicts between Chase and Pollard: the former an overeager upstart who questioned Pollard's authority, the latter too meek to rule authoritatively (Greg Dening's Mr. Bligh's Bad Language is a wonderful case study of how difficult maintaining power properly is at sea). The crew had the option of sailing west, but chose to sail east due to fear of cannibals on the South Pacific islands (the irony not being lost in Melville's interpretation). The Essex was a remarkably alluring story - of nature's revenge, of mismanagement in crisis, of human ingenuity and accomplishment in the face of disaster - and was one of the most famous seafaring incidents of the century. The Essex's fame is in part due to the uniqueness of the whale attack, though. Right before Moby Dick was published, the Ann Alexander was similarly charged and sunk by a sperm whale in 1851; unlike the Essex, the crew were recovered just a few days later. There is certainly truth to whales attacking and sinking ships, but they are very rare. Nathaniel Philbrook's In the Heart of the Sea is a great read that dives into the Essex; at times it is probably too conjectural, but it's nonetheless worth reading. Nickerson and Chase's accounts are certainly worth reading as well, with similar caveats for framing and, for Nickerson, timing.\",\n",
       " 'Great questions! The short answers are: yes, there were Black owned and operated radio and television stations, though not in the early years of either and relatively few in number overall. In both cases, there was much more content produced by Black creators for Black audiences -- sometimes aired through mainstream networks, sometimes through separate/independent channels aimed at Black markets. On radio, I recommend William Barlow\\'s Voice Over: The Making of Black Radio Black culture (and blackface minstrelsy...) was a major current in American popular culture writ large at the dawn of commercial radio -- after all, we colloquially refer to the period as \"The Jazz Age.\" So it was common to hear Black cultural forms (music, comedy, etc.) on any radio station. \\'Mainstream\\' radio stations, however, generally programmed with an exclusively white audience in mind, and would regularly use white performers to cover these works. Some did carry explicitly \\'Negro\\' programming, though, by the late 1920s -- Jack Cooper\\'s \"The All Negro Hour\" is noteworthy here. Cooper was particularly ambitious -- while I don\\'t think he ever owned a broadcast station, he did control the entire production of his show (including, if I recall, ownership of the recording facilities). (I don\\'t think this is exactly what you meant by ownership/production, but as a bit of an aside: one significant turning point for Black artists in early-ish in radio history came about as a result of the ASCAP boycott their new rival, BMI, was more willing to break the color line. This brought significantly more Black artists on commercial radio and, importantly, meant they could earn royalties -- an ownership stake in the content.) I\\'ll say a little about Black television in a second, but the more significant impact of television on Black media of the mid-century was from its indirect effects on commercial radio. Radio broadcasters saw an impending collapse of their business model with the popular adoption of television, and found themselves scrambling to evolve. This led to two critical developments: first, radio stations in urban markets began to experiment with a \\'black appeal\\' format in the early 50s. Radio was largely decentralized and locally owned in the early- to mid-twentieth century, so a few of these stations were Black owned -- WERD in Atlanta was the first, in 1949 -- but most were not. Regardless of ownership, though, these were much more likely to be staffed and/or managed by Black operators, and offered programming aimed at black audiences. The second development was the adoption of almost exclusively musical formats. This was mostly done at first as a cost-saving measure (records were a lot cheaper than recording a radio drama), but it turned out to be the perfect format for car radios. And as it happened, cars were a domain where white suburban teenagers could experiment free of their parents\\' prying eyes. Between those two forces, these \\'black appeal\\' stations and their programming (along with much more frequently Black-owned record stores) were absolutely foundational to the early development of rock and roll -- they created the audience and the market. For more on this, I recommend Altschuler\\'s All Shook Up The barriers to entry for commercial television broadcasting meant that there was, to my knowledge, no Black owners of any stations or major production facilities during the first few decades of television. By the mid-1960s, however, media representation and ownership became major topics of concern for Black community leaders and activists of all stripes -- famously the Black Panthers published their own newspaper for this reason. There were also a number of efforts from Black creators at producing content for public/community access radio and television formats throughout this period: one well-documented example is Black Journal which began airing in 1968. (Devorah Heitner\\'s Black Power TV provides a deep dive on Black Journal and a local show called Inside Bedford-Stuyvesant.) As for broadcast facilities, the first Black-owned television station was WGPR-TV in Detroit, which came on air in 1975. This was significant, and the station largely used Black talent both behind and in front of the camera. But it was also short-lived: cable television was already on the rise, and BET would debut five years later. WGPR-TV continued through the 1980s and had a bit of a cult following (side note: one of their most popular programs was Arab Voice of Detroit, if you\\'re interested in other media by and for PoC), but their audience was always limited and they never expanded beyond the Detroit metro. WGPR-TV got picked up by one of the Big 3 networks in the 1990s. Not to end on a down note, but that also serves as a bit of a coda to this whole thing: deregulation and consolidation in the late 20th century swept up many of the independent Black studios and almost all (of the already few) Black-owned broadcast stations. Of course, Black representation also increased substantially in \\'mainstream\\' broadcast media over the same period -- though often in a \\'universalized\\' or less racially specific format (white washed, if you prefer) -- so make of that tradeoff what you will. Edit: Whoops! I said NOT to end on a down note. Obviously, some late twentieth century Black-owned broadcast endeavors were tremendously successful',\n",
       " 'Well, the first thing you need to understand is that it is not the case that we never picked up on railroads. America used to have the most advanced railroad network in the world, and when it comes to freight rail, we still do. What we have lost most of is passenger rail capacity, and the reasons this happened are varied, but generally boil down to \"We made a conscious decision not to invest in the future of passenger rail transportation\". To understand why this is, it is important to know how early American railroads were paid for. It was a mix of government contracts, and free real estate. Passenger rail generally isn\\'t profitable, even in Europe and Asia, and the two biggest examples of passenger rail systems that are profitable, the Paris to Lyon TGV and the Japanese Shinkansen, are higher priced express services that invest heavily in real estate ventures in their stations, and make more money from real estate than passenger services. This was also the case back in the early days of American rail, back before the \"frontier\" was closed, when the federal government was handing out free land like candy if people were willing to use it. If you built a rail line, you would get a lot of free land for doing so, and there are multiple ways to spin that land into a healthy profit. When I say government contracts, I mostly mean mail contracts. Passenger trains generally had a mail car because the Postal Service was paying the railroads to move the mail, and that money did a lot to subsidize passenger rail and make it profitable. There were also some cases, such as the Transcontinental Railroad, where the government really wanted a specific line built, and directly paid a railroad per mile for doing so, though this was not most rail lines. The important take away here is, passenger rail in and of itself isn\\'t really a money maker, and government investment, both in terms of giving out land and paying the railroads to do things, was critically important to making passenger rail actually work. And because of this, in 1873 a massive bubble in railroad investment burst, because a ton of people saw railroads as the up and coming technology and invested, especially with the government land grants sweetening the deal, and a ton of people built as much rail as they could thinking they\\'d rake in the profits, only to find rail operations weren\\'t so profitable and there were too many players, and a lot of mergers and market consolidation ended up happening as railroads failed. So, passenger rail wasn\\'t hugely profitable, and was dependent on government support, even before the automobile arose as competition. And when the automobile does enter the scene, well, the government is absolutely entranced, and moves to support this up and coming technology. In the 1920s and 1930s, we already see the beginnings of car centric urban planning and people thinking of the car as the future of transportation, but the Great Depression really slows down the adoption of the car, though municipal governments are already enacting zoning policies that heavily favor the car. One cannot ignore the importance of race in this conversation either, though, because these car centric zoning policies weren\\'t just implemented because people wanted cars and not public transit. People wanted to \"clean up the cities\" and \"live in healthier environments\", and these are really code terms for \"get white people away from racial minorities and into their own nice, safe neighborhoods\". The end effect is to cripple public transportation, but the intent is racial segregation, even (often especially) in jurisdictions outside of the Jim Crow South. So we have railroads that are dependent on government investment, and a government more interested in investing in the automobile. In takes time for the government to fully realize that desire, as World War 2 prevents further adoption of the automobile, but World War 2 isn\\'t great for passenger rail, either. During the war, the government asks people to ride intercity trains as little as possible to conserve fuel, and forces railroads to build more steam engines instead of diesel (diesel was needed oversees), engines that rapidly became obsolete post war outside of mountainous areas (steam engines could be better at hauling in steep grades compared to early diesel). In the 1920s and 1930s, we see the rise of the streamlined locomotive in the United States, with streamlined steam in the 1920s and diesel in the 1930s. This sees struggling railroads trying to gain passenger share with high speed, aerodynamic trains, beautiful styling, and celebrity-studded services. And it both works and doesn\\'t work. This is considered the golden age of American railroading, so it works in that people do indeed love these trains and want to ride them, but it doesn\\'t work in the vein that the railroads still weren\\'t turning a profit, and now weren\\'t really getting government support. And these trains aren\\'t really competing with the automobile. This is before the interstate highway system existed, so driving long distance from, say, New York to Chicago isn\\'t as simple as just taking the freeway, and domestic commercial aviation is a very small industry at this time, so if you own a car and want to go from Chicago to Los Angeles, taking a train makes a lot of sense compared to driving or flying. As soon as the interstate highway system comes into being, we rapidly see passenger rail collapse, because suddenly driving makes sense. Especially since the federal government was providing car loans to veterans post-war, and local governments were forcing sprawled out housing developments and mandating large parking facilities that take up valuable real estate and give it to cars. One can point to the government implementing speed limits for railroads that prevent them from being faster than driving as a crucial factor, but this speed limit was implemented specifically because cash strapped railroads couldn\\'t maintain their rails and the rails weren\\'t safe for higher speeds, and railroads would have had to limit speeds or kill passengers, anyway. Some railroads could afford the technology needed to run above this speed limit legally, but that didn\\'t address the underlying problems. Not to mention there were high taxes on railroads post-war, taxes which went to the interstate highway and car loans, which basically meant railroads were being forced to directly subsidize their main competitor. So by the late 60s, passenger rail is in complete crisis, so the government forms a national railroad, Amtrak. I\\'m going to skip over a lot, here, but the important thing to understand is, joining Amtrak is a voluntary decision, and how it works is, a railroad has to give up all passenger services to Amtrak (you can\\'t pick and choose). Any railroad at this time runs both passenger and freight, so Amtrak is getting the passenger services and rolling stock, but not the tracks or right of way. So suddenly passenger rail is operating on the same tracks as freight, but the tracks are owned by the freight railroad and the passenger trains run by an organization that isn\\'t the freight railroad. Naturally the freight railroad is going to prioritize their own services, and force Amtrak to get out of the way of freight trains. Meaning Amtrak is wracked with delays and can\\'t run on time, outside of the corridors like the Northeast Corridor where Amtrak does own the tracks. This is also why Amtrak doesn\\'t have high speed rail outside the Northeast Corridor, and isn\\'t allowed to electrify. The freight railroads own most track, and make the rules. And as said above, America has the best freight rail system in the world today. And, well, there you have the biggest factors. Why is Europe better? European governments are willing to subsidize rail. Same with China. It is really hard to get numbers out of China, because they don\\'t like to disclose this kind of financial information, but it is impossible that China isn\\'t massively subsidizing high speed rail. Given that most Chinese airspace is closed to civilian aviation, creating huge traffic jams in what airspace isn\\'t military only, it makes sense that China would want as many people on trains as possible. As for sources, I will post them, but I need a few hours. I need to go to the store before they close, and I\\'ll get to that after.',\n",
       " \"That was absolutely true. There were many men trapped, particularly in the Oklahoma, which capsized within 15 minutes of being hit for the first time. Exactly how many men can't be said for sure. Over 400 officers and sailors were listed as dead or missing in her wreck, and by the time salvage operations progressed far enough to find bodies, they'd been underwater for as long as a year. That makes cause of death an impossibility to judge; there just wasn't enough left to tell. Now for the good news. Rescue efforts on the capsized Oklahoma began even before the Japanese raid had ended. USS Maryland, moored inboard from Oklahoma and thus shielded by her, was almost totally undamaged. Her crew immediately set to work on locating trapped sailors via the banging coming from the inside of the ship. The truly difficult part came in getting to them without accidentally killing them. To do this they had to cut through the steel hull of a battleship using torches, impact hammers, and metal saws. Apart from the difficulty of doing that, there were the twin worries of air loss and fire. When you cut a hole in a capsized ship, you let trapped air out, raising the water levels and potentially drowning the very men you're trying to save. To complicate matters, fuel was stored in tanks along the bottom and sides of the hull, and one cut in a bad place could easily start a gigantic fire. With skill and luck, rescue crews made up of both civilians and military managed to pull 32 sailors out of the Oklahoma within 24 hours. Sadly, it's probable that others were not as lucky, but as mentioned before, it's impossible to know. We do know that on the West Virginia, three sailors survived for 16 days, trapped belowdecks with emergency rations and fresh water... we know this because they left hash marks on the wall of their room denoting the days. Sadly, they were found nearly six months after the attack, when salvage and recovery for that ship progressed far enough. recommended readings: At Dawn We Slept - Gordon Prange (old, but still worthwhile) Descent into Darkness - Edward C Raymer.

       " 'As mainstream spy fiction goes, The Americans is pretty good in terms of verisimilitude — no doubt helped by the fact that the series\\' creator, Joe Weisberg, was briefly a CIA officer. There are broadly two types of intelligence officer: the first are those who operate under \\'legal\\' cover, commonly as diplomats or embassy employees. These officers conceal their espionage work behind the facade of other, more mundane government work. The second are those who work under \\'illegal\\' cover (the US intelligence community uses the term \\'non-official cover\\'); they are outwardly not government employees, and thus do not have diplomatic protection — but they\\'re also less likely to attract the attention of foreign counterintelligence services. In the KGB, foreign operations were the purview of the First Chief Directorate, a vast service-within-a-service with myriad sub-departments — some responsible for specific geographical areas (eg. First Department, responsible for North America), others for specific types of intelligence (eg. Directorate T, responsible for scientific and technological intelligence.) In The Americans, Philip and Elizabeth Jennings are portrayed as working for Directorate S — which did indeed exist, and was responsible for managing the KGB\\'s \\'illegals\\'. Directorate S officers were unusual in that they typically posed as foreign nationals, using elaborately-constructed \\'legends\\' to conceal their Soviet ties. Directorate S was a particularly secretive department within a notoriously secret service, but we do now have significant information about its organisation and operations. In 1992, a KGB officer named Vasili Mitrokhin, who had spent more than a decade supervising the KGB\\'s archives, defected to the UK — bringing with him thousands of pages of copies and notes he had made on the archives, particularly those of Directorate S. Mitrokhin has subsequently worked with Christopher Andrew, one of the world\\'s pre-eminent intelligence historians, on two superb histories of the KGB\\'s foreign operations — The Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret History of the KGB and The World Was Going Our Way: The KGB and the Battle for the the Third World According to Andrew & Mitrokhin: The illegals retained a curious mystique within the KGB. Before being posted abroad, every illegal officer was required to swear a solemn, if somewhat melodramatic, oath: \"Deeply valuing the trust placed upon me by the Party and the fatherland, and imbued with a sense of intense gratitude for the decision to send me to the sharp edge of the struggle for the interest of my people... as a worthy son of the homeland, I would rather perish than betray the secrets entrusted to me or put into the hand of the adversary materials which could cause political harm to the interests of the State. With every heartbeat, with every day that passes, I swear to serve the Party, the homeland, and the Soviet people.\" (If that oath sounds faintly familiar to fans of The Americans, it\\'s because it\\'s recited verbatim in S01E12!) Early KGB \\'illegals\\' were commonly European communists, and were responsible for some of Soviet intelligence\\'s most outstanding successes; Arnold Deutsch, an Austrian working in the UK under academic cover in the 1930s, recruited and handled the Cambridge Five, arguably the best-placed agents the Soviets ever recruited in the west. Deutsch\\'s successor as the Cambridge ring\\'s controller, Theodore Maly, was a former priest originally from Romania. Soviet intelligence would spend decades attempting to replicate the success of the \\'Great Illegals\\' of the 1930s and 1940s, investing significant energy in recruiting and training these officers. Quoting from Jonathan Haslam\\'s Near and Distant Neighbours It took at least seven years to train an illegal from scratch so that he or she would pass unnoticed. Moreover, life under deep cover was very demanding. The illegal had “to act no differently from the inhabitants of the country where he lives,” Yuri Drozdov, former head of illegals, reminds us. “In illegal intelligence there is no privacy, almost everything will be painful and uncomfortable if one does not submit oneself to the demands of the service. Above all one must be completely open and account for everything one does, including one’s personal life.” The best-known of the KGB\\'s \\'illegals\\' was Rudolf Abel — real name William Fisher, born in Britain to Russian parents. In the late 1940s he was recruited to become an illegal in the MGB (predecessor to the KGB), and dispatched to the United States. Christopher Andrew\\'s account of Fisher\\'s infiltration illustrates the painstaking effort taken to conceal his true identity: His legend was unusually complicated. Fisher assumed one identity during his journey to the United States in 1948 and another shortly after his arrival. The first identity was that of Andrei Yurgesovich Kayotis, a Lithuanian born in 1895 who had emigrated to the United States and become an American citizen. In November 1947 Kayotis crossed the Atlantic to visit relatives in Europe. While he was in Denmark, the Soviet embassy issued a travel document enabling him to visit Russia and retained his passport for use by Fisher. In October 1948 Fisher traveled to Warsaw on a Soviet passport, then traveled on Kayotis’s passport via Czechoslovakia and Switzerland to Paris, where he purchased a transatlantic ticket on the SS Scythia. On November 6 he set sail from Le Havre to Quebec, traveled on to Montreal and—still using Kayotis’s passport—crossed into the United States on November 17. The legacy of the \\'illegals\\' has continued even after the end of the Cold War: Directorate S continues to exist as part of SVR, Russia\\'s present-day foreign intelligence service, formed from the First Chief Directorate after the dissolution of the KGB. In 2010, in a case that was the primary inspiration for The Americans, the FBI arrested ten SVR illegals in the United States — eight of them married couples.',\n",
       " 'I don\\'t believe the balls were to be used during actual raids, more for training; in the novel it\\'s a story related to Edith Pretty: \"The cabbie told me that on the previous evening there had been an air-raid drill near to his home in Battersea. A warden had driven round the streets, throwing out different-coloured tennis balls from his car. Yellow and green balls denoted gas; red denoted high explosives, while those with red stripes represented incendiary bombs.\" During a raid most people were expected to take shelter, so wouldn\\'t be looking out for balls, but there was a warning for gas - wardens carried wooden rattles to alert people to don their gas masks, fear of aerial gas attack being widespread in the interwar years but thankfully not realised (see a previous question for further details of fears and preparations for gas attack). The scene in The Dig may well be fictitious, though, I\\'ve never encountered similar descriptions in any accounts of pre-war Air Raid Precaution preparations. There were various training efforts - from Richard Overy\\'s The Bombing War, for example: \"In the summer of 1939 the Hull ARP organization ran regular training demonstrations of bombs and their effects in local parks; after detonating a miniature but very noisy high-explosive bomb, the training focused on gas bombs. Persistent gases (mustard gas and lewisite) were identified by smell; non-persistent gases were released in small quantities and the trainees warned to stand upwind while they observed its passage.\" Using different coloured balls rather than actual bombs has a ring of plausibility to it, it\\'s not entirely impossible that an individual warden may have run such a exercise somewhere, but it wasn\\'t a widespread thing as far as I can make out.',\n",

       " 'Short answer- if they refused to do something a guard wanted, they (almost definitely) got shot. Which is pretty much what you can assume happened in any case in which a Jewish concentration camp inmate didn\\'t do what was asked of them by a Nazi guard, and sometimes even if they DID. They could be shot with impunity. But shaving was generally something that was often done to prisoners in general, not just beards and not just for humiliation purposes, once they arrived and were processed at concentration camps. You may be thinking of in the time period BEFORE concentration camps, in which, indeed, shaving a rabbi\\'s (or any bearded Jewish man\\'s) beard was seen as a way to humiliate both him personally and the Jewish people in general. (That said, not all camps required inmates to shave- transit and labor camps were less likely to require it, and several memoirs I\\'ve seen include descriptions of bearded men.) Humiliation in general was an extremely common tactic by Nazis once they had arrived in a place and gained control over the local Jewish population, and while any Jew could wind up the target of this degrading treatment, often communal leaders, rabbis, upper-class Jews, and identifiable Jews in general were singled out publicly. Beard-shaving was only one of many such methods. For example, following the Anschluss, many of these sorts of figures were ordered to clean the streets of Vienna (a city with a 1/6 Jewish population) with their bare hands, with Rabbi Dr Taglicht, rabbi of one of the largest synagogues in Vienna, ordered to do so while wearing his tallis (prayer shawl); other Jews were ordered to clean bathrooms while wearing tefillin (phylacteries), something which is not only degrading but a violation of Jewish law. Men and women, particularly the elderly, were forced to do mindless yet harsh physical activity for SS guards\\' amusement, often leading to fatal heart attacks. Suicide rates among Jews skyrocketed. Many of these humiliated Jews were fortunate enough to be able to take advantage of opportunities to leave Austria to other countries, knowing from this humiliation that there was no future for them there. Many, many others weren\\'t so lucky. Once the Nazis invaded Poland and WWII began, the opportunities to leave dwindled to none but the humiliations continued. As ghettos were formed, humiliation of communal leaders and rabbis remained part of the Nazi stock in trade. There is at least one well known picture of a Nazi soldier forcibly removing the beard of an elderly Jew, and memoirs include many more descriptions of such events- and even worse, descriptions of elderly men who had their beards ripped off their faces, leaving them bloody. While removing beards was often seen as a way of humiliating these men, in other cases leaving rabbis\\' beards as they forced them to do degrading things was its own method of humiliation- one memoir I looked at while researching this question, for example, described two rabbis with matted beards and sidelocks being forced to entertain the Nazis (and, purportedly, the Jewish laborers at the Janowska labor camp) by singing and dancing. A responsum by Rabbi Ephraim Oshry gives a lot of insight into a typical situation and the implications for Jewish law- he was a young rabbi in the Kovno (Lithuania) Ghetto, which was a largely Orthodox ghetto in a town that had been the site of a famous yeshiva, who answered questions of Jewish law which were often heartbreaking (and about whom I wrote here His questions and answers were buried in the ghetto and he retrieved and published them after the war. I\\'ll quote this responsum in full here: Question: In our suffering under the hands of the accursed Germans who daily sought to cause us physical and mental anguish by their decrees of all kinds, one of the charges they laid against us was that Jews are filthy and carry all kinds of infectious diseases. They were especially furious with any Jew who wore a beard- which most Orthodox Jews did. When the accursed evildoers saw a bearded Jew, they immediately subjected him to ridicule and harassment, with death as a possible result. Intimidated, all the bearded ghetto dwellers removed their beards- even the rabbis and Torah sages; they realized it was absolutely impossible to leave their beards intact no matter how much they suffered internally at having to give up their emulation of the \"divine image.\" The Jewish leaders were compelled to remove their beards for another reason: A special goal of the Germans was the destruction of the Jewish leadership. A beard was seen by the Germans as identifying a rabbi, and the Rabbiner were singled out to be hounded mercilessly and killed outright. The rabbis were consequently constrained to remove their beards in order to protect their lives. Only two people in the ghetto retained their beards. One was the rabbi of Kovno, Rabbi Avraham DovBer Kahana-Shapira, who did not remove his beard because he was known to the Germans and stood to gain nothing by removing his beard. He therefore guarded the honor of Jewry by leaving his beard intact. The second individual was one of the most important householders in Kovno, a chasid of Chabad, Rav Feivel Zussman, who took the risk involved and did not remove his beard. He managed to retain his Jewish pride and glory for a number of years- until the Kinderakxion of 3 and 4 Nissan 5704- March 27 and 28, 1944. On that day the Germans searched every single attic and basement, cave and tunnel, in order to find the unfortunate children whom they dragged out to be annihilated. G-d! Avenge their sacred, pure blood! To facilitate transportation of ghetto laborers to the airfield outside Kovno, the Germans set up a camp for slave laborers outside Aleksot, a suburb of Kovno nearest the airfield. One of the Jews confined to this camp asked me what to do about his beard since in the camp there was no implement for removing his beard other than a razor blade. His question was whether he might be permitted to remove his beard with the razor because of the danger to his life. Response: I ruled that he might shave with the razor since there is no disagreement among the authorities that it is permissible to remove one\\'s beard with a razor to save one\\'s life. There was not even a non-Jew available in the prisoner-of-war camp to shave this man so as to circumvent his being shaved by a Jew, whether himself or another. But even if there had been a non-Jew in the camp, it would have made no difference because the accursed Germans forbade non-Jews to help Jews in any way. 1/2',\n",

       " 'OK, sorry for responding your first attempt (since it is not always so easy to offer a satisfactory answer to your \\'why X didn\\'t Y\\' type question). I\\'m not sure whether my following tentative answer can satisfy your curiosity, but anyway I can summarize some essential historiographical discussions concerning the origin and identify formation of the Rurikid dynasty (ruling elite of Kievan Rus\\') from a comparative point of view below. 1: Possible Problematic Premise: Did Norman Conquest belong to the typical pattern of Norse-Viking settlement movement in the so-called Viking Age? Tl; dr: Norman conquest, allegedly accompanying with the drastic linguistic as well as cultural change in 11th century England, was not a typical \\'Viking conquest\\'. I assume I can understand why you tried to compare the formation (aggregation, possibly by military expedition or tribute taking) of the Rus\\' state with the Norman conquest, since the traditional (and notorious) historiographical debate on the origin of Kievan Rus\\' is called \\'Norman controversy\\'. The concept/ word \\'Normans\\' has not a single meaning, however, and as I argued in Should the Norman Conquest be understood as another “Viking” incursion into England, or something different? and Did Normandy in William\\'s time and before retain cultural links with Norway? the Normans in Normandy had already lost much of their cultural ties with Scandinavia and assimilated with the local population by 1066. Thus, many people (including myself) suppose that the Normans in 1066 was enough \\'Vikings\\' in general sense. The Norman\\'s relationship with the conquered local population (English) after the revolts in 1070s was different from other \\'Viking\\' conquest since the late 9th century CE: almost total displacement of the English as a ruling local elite, as attested in Domesday Book (Thomas 2008), though the explanation by /u/BRIStoneman in How Anglo-saxon is the British nobility? is much more nuanced. The pattern of settlement as well as the assimilation with the local population of the Norse people during the Viking Age differed from one place to another, so it is not so always easy to present the coherent picture. Not to mention it would be much difficult to compare the Norman invasion of England with the Rus\\' settlement in Volga-Dnieper waterways. 2:Hybrid Identity Formation of the Kievan Rus\\' elites (Rurikid) As Downham illustrates, by the middle of the 20th century, and still in some popular history, Viking expansion had often been treated as a variant of national colonies of the Vikings, such as \"Norwegian Vikings\\' expansion\" into the North Atlantic and \"the settlement of Swedes\" into Russia. Some vehement criticism found in Russian scholars on the Norman controversy occurred in this context. Now fortunately (?), we don\\'t have to decide which \\'racial\\' label, either Slavic or Scandinavian, we should applied to the 10th century Rus\\' people: Recent research has increasingly focused on the rather poly-ethnic-cultural origins of the new \\'Christian\\' ruling elite group of Rus\\' in the end of the 1st millennium (Duczko 2004; Tolochko 2008). In other words, they suppose the Kievan Rus\\' around 1000 was de facto ruling group with the newly unified identity, originally based on diverse ethnic-cultural elements centered in Kiev and Russia, the crossroad of various peoples and trading activity. Not only local Slavic and trading-mercenary Scandinavian, but also some Byzantine and even steppe (Khazar) traits was merged in this new group. The following are some examples of such ex-poly-ethnic cultural elements found in the new Rus\\' in late 10th and early 11th century: Scandinavian: the label of the group, Rus\\' Slavic: Personal name within the ruling family, such as Sviatoslav, Vladimir, and also, Iaroslav. This switch from Old Norse to Slavic in proper names occurred early around the middle of the 10th century. Byzantine: Christianity and male dressing style, modeled on skaramangion Steppe: Bident (forked spear) and Trident motif, found on some coins issued by the ruler of Kievan Rus\\', like Vladimir (see this link Sviatoslav is also said to have adapted some way of life from the steppe people. From this point of view, the characteristics of the Rurikid had always been hybrid, as also attested in the famous Russian Primary Chronicle (Cf. Rukavishnikov 2003), rather than sole Scandinavian almost from the beginning, at least since the middle of the 10th century during the reign of Sviatoslav (d. 971). Even compared with another contemporary Rus\\' group in the 10th century Russia like those who were active in Volga-Bulgar region, the Rurikid could be regarded as \\'less Scandinavian\\', as a recent textbook on the Vikings points out (Nordeide and Edwards 2019).

       " 'Any of the books by Svetlana Alexeivich are fantastic. Her books are oral histories that examine major events in Soviet history, such as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and Chernobyl, through interviews and first hand accounts of the people who lived through them. Here’s a couple of her books: “Zinky boys: Stories from the Afghanistan war” Zinky boys refers to the Zink coffins in which Soviet casualties were sent back from Afghanistan. Alexeivich Interviews dozens of people who were connected to the war in some capacity: enlisted men, officers, part officials, journalists, nurses, civilian contractors, family members, etc. and gets their takes on the war, both at home and on the front, and the many ways in which the war affected peoples day to day lives before, during, and after the war. “Chernobyl” This book was partially used as a basis for the HBO series, so you may be familiar with some of it. It follows the same general format as Zinky Boys. “Secondhand time: The last of the soviets” Secondhand Time is probably the most comprehensive book of hers, covering the collapse of the Soviet Union and including material from the late 1980s to the 2010s. She interviews hundreds of people, in interviews spanning from a few sentences picked up at a protest to chapter long interviews taken over the course of months. She talks to people from all across Soviet society, from workers to politicians, the old and the young, from Siberia to Ukraine. How has life changed? How do people reconcile their past with the uncertainty of the future? What does it mean to be Soviet? Or Russian, or Ukrainian, or Lithuanian? It’s an incredible book, and i don’t think one reddit comment can do it justice. If you read any of her books, start with this one. Just a warning, as fantastic as her books are, they’re also, by nature of their subject matter, incredibly depressing. I often found it hard to read more than a chapter at a time because they made me feel empty, or want to cry, or both.',\n",

There are documented accounts from the mid-19th century throughout Chinese population centres in SE Asia, including Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. Society houses (along with Native Place Associations 同鄉會) are still to be found in many of these places. They were also to be found in places like San Francisco, Honolulu, Vancouver and elsewhere in the western hemisphere. Anywhere you\\'d encounter native-place associations you\\'d also find Hongmen/Tiandihui or similar organisations. In many cases it was the secret societies and the various native-place associations that formed the backbone not only of trade but also intelligence networks throughout Southeast Asia at the time, but also well into the US and Canada. The various non-secret-society association, in particular in the US the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, functioned as basically embassies in lieu of a direct Qing presence, just to give an idea of the importance of societies in general. The \"secret societies\" often were ultimately just variants on a theme, and much of the secrecy was theatre anyway. But they were not easily separable from the non-\"secret\" societies that were incredibly important to nearly anyone who was part of the various diaspora communities.',\n",
       " 'There\\'s always more to be said, but in the meantime you may find some answers about America\\'s decision to initially pursue a sustained aerial bombing campaign in Vietnam and the transition to primarily a ground war strategy here by u/enygma9753. The US view was that they were only there to \"assist\" South Vietnam in repelling a communist insurgency, as part of the West\\'s attempt to contain the spread of communism in southeast Asia. South Vietnam was created as a democratic nation in the aftermath of the First Indochina War between France and communist insurgents, where France lost its colonial foothold in the region. On paper, the U.S. allying with South Vietnam seemed to be the prudent and logical choice. The leadership of South Vietnam was pro-West, anti-communist and formed from the ruling class of Catholic elites who remained. Its leaders were however extremely corrupt, increasingly undemocratic and oppressive to the non-Catholic majority in South Vietnam. Domestically, it became harder as the war wore on for the Johnson and Nixon administrations to continue to justify their propping up of such a corrupt regime. It was seen as a necessary evil in the greater context of the Cold War and the belief that Vietnam falling to communism would cause a chain reaction or domino effect in the region, as other nations (in theory) could fall under Soviet or Chinese influence. The US trained the South Vietnamese army in the hopes that they would take up more of the fighting gradually. This process of \"Vietnamization\" accelerated under Nixon. South Vietnamese forces, while well-trained, were heavily dependent on US air power. Once the US withdrew its forces from the region by 1973, South Vietnam found itself overwhelmed and unable to stop the North Vietnamese army and Viet Cong incursions. Saigon fell to North Vietnamese forces in April 1975.',\n",

       " 'I replied a few months ago about this : A little more elaboration: Generally, the colours available to the lower/working class were dyes obtainable locally from plants without a lot of additional preparation, along with the colours generally found in sheep (wool being the predominant fibre for outer clothing for most people.) So these would include the wide variety of plants that produce yellows and oranges (such as weld, dyer\\'s broom, etc.), and browns (walnut being a fairly well-known one). Blue was produced from woad and can be processed using urine, which is, of course, available everywhere. Weld and woad can be combined in a two-step process to produce green. Red was a little trickier; madder (produced from a root) is fairly common (basic madder red is often known as Turkey red) but intense shades took more processing. I also mention in the reply above that dyebaths were often used for several rounds of dyeing, with the most costly articles dyed in the first round and less costly ones dyed in subsequent \"dips\" (known as exhaust baths), leading to the phenomenon of more muted shades being associated with lower-class items. One of the reasons reds and purples are associated with the upper classes and royalty is that the dyestuffs which produce the most intense, light-fast results were extremely costly. These include murex (Tyrian or Imperial purple--actually, more of a reddish wine colour, extracted from a type of mollusk), cochineal (ground-up insects), brazilwood, and, by the 16th century, logwood (blues, purples, reds, and eventually, black). There is also alkanet, which is widely available but not water soluble, so it needs special preparation before being used, and produces lavenders and purples that are not quite as light fast as some of these other dyes. Madder can also be used in more complex dyebaths with mordants and with tweaks to pH to produce very deep shades of red, including crimson. True black was a difficult shade to obtain, although deep browns and greys were more common. One of the most common processes involved a multi-step process involving dyeing first with woad, and then overdying with madder. I mentioned logwood above--this is a New World dyestuff and is responsible for the black dyes that became associated with Spanish clothing first, and produced something approaching a \"true black\" that was colourfast and didn\\'t degrade the fabric as some other iron-based dyes that could produce black colours. By the 16th century anyone with any pretense of status was seeking out black clothing, with it becoming ubiquitous for both the upper and merchant classes by the 17th century. City-dwelling merchants and craftspeople (I like this term better than \"middle class\") would have access to commercially-available cloth (as well as tailors), and tended to buy the most costly fabric they could afford (which is in fact the origins of \"sumptuary laws\" restricting certain fibres and colours to certain classes; these were usually observed more in the breach, with being able to pay the fines being a source of pride). Those of the labouring classes that lived in the countryside might also have had some access to commercially-produced cloth, but also homespun-and-dyed cloth. For obvious reasons, therefore, the dye processes would need to be simple and straightforward using locally-available dyestuffs, with the very poorest likely forgoing dyeing altogether.',\n",
       " \"This depends a great deal on the time period and especially the specific site under discussion. The vast majority of texts from the Ur III period (ca. 2100-2000 BCE) are administrative and economic texts, for instance, whereas texts from the Neo-Assyrian period are more varied and include treaties, personal letters, literary texts, court records, omen texts, historical annals, and so on. Similarly, the distribution of genres varies enormously between sites. Copies of nearly all of the known Sumerian literary texts have been found in the city of Nippur in southern Iraq, whereas the contemporary city of Ebla in Syria has primarily yielded administrative and economic texts. It should be emphasized that the tablets discovered at each site are often not representative of the site as a whole but rather reflect the dates and functions of the buildings excavated thus far by archaeologists. In other words, you're going to find different genres of texts in an Old Babylonian house than in a Neo-Assyrian temple. A mere 3% of Babylon has been excavated so far, and many Mesopotamian sites have received markedly less attention (if any at all!), so there is still a lot to be found. Marc Van de Mieroop has a good chart with a breakdown of the relative popularity of text genres by time period in Cuneiform Texts and the Writing of History.

       " 'There were definitely political and economic aspects to antislavery politics. I would go so far as to say the majority of opposition to slavery (or at least slavery\\'s expansion) was political and economic in nature. Bona fide abolitionists--properly defined in the 19th century as people who wanted not only the end of slavery, but enfranchisement of former slaves, were a small minority of Northerners (and were often disliked even by their Northern brethren). If you were to poll Northern residents about the morality of slavery, most would probably say it was \"wrong,\" but they could shrug it off easily enough. Almost from the beginning of the Constitution, there was considerable political resentment at the South\\'s outsized influence due to the 3/5 clause concerning representation. It was so contentious that it featured prominently in some Antifederalist literature. This problem was amplified by the Senate, since all States received 2 Senators regardless of size, and as western States grew, Northern population considerably outstripped Southern population by the 1830s, yet the South\\'s voice in the Senate was equal to that of the rest of the country. To add to that, the political class of the South was connected to slavery in a much more intimate way than Northern politicians were connected to the growing industries and financial interests in the North. Then as now, money talked in politics, but in the South the planter class tended to be the political class, such that almost all Southern Senators, governors, and other high office holders were themselves slaveholders, many with enormous estates and a vested financial interest in the slave system. Thus a considerable number of Northerners came to resent and fear what was termed \"The Slave Power\" (or sometimes the Slave Power Conspiracy). The Mexican War provides a good case study of this. Although many Northerners shared a desire for expansionism (and often shared racist rationales of Southern expansionists), Northern Whigs were the least likely members of Congress to vote in favor of the Mexican War, castigating it as the effort of an aggressive Democratic Party seeking to serve the interests of its aristocratic, Southern masters. Abraham Lincoln, in his only term in the House, took to the floor to condemn President Polk and the war faction largely for this reason. The thinking went that most of the new lands captured within Mexico would be opened to slavery, and provide the South with even more political clout. Pennsylvania Democrat David Wilmot attempted to push through a provision that would have outlawed slavery in ceded territories but it was easily defeated in the Senate. This gets us to the core of antislavery economics--The Free Soil Movement that blossomed after the Mexican War A considerable number of Northern workers and farmers feared that if slavery were to expand into western territories unchecked, it would crowd them out. Small farmers believed (rightly) they could not compete with the economic power of plantation holders, and pro-slavery interests bought up many of the richest lands near the Mississippi and Missouri rivers in Missouri, and were making inroads along the Kansas River in Kansas as well. Free laborers also disdained the presence of slavery since it in essence drove the wage floor down to zero (a number of these \"Free Soil\" men had no great love for slaves, either, despising them alongside their masters). The precedents of the Kansas-Nebraska Act and the Dred Scott Case were not lost on Northern politicians, either, since it was now theoretically possible for industrialists to purchase slaves in Kentucky or Missouri, drive them across the border to the North, and set up a factory staffed by slave laborers, as Lincoln alluded to in the Senate campaign of 1858. Even where farming was not a major concern, free laborers feared the possibility that in western, mountainous states, mining operations would be conducted by slaves if they did not block the ambitions of the slaveholding class. Summary: Northerners resented the outsized role that slavery gave the South in terms of representation. Farmers feared being crowded out by plantation holders and dominated by a slaveholding aristocracy. Free laborers disdained the further curtailing of their rights and economic fortunes through competition with slave labor.

The naming, to some, may seem paradoxical or odd, as the Danish economy and position in the world was taking hit after hit: one of the greatest national treasures (The Golden Horns) was lost, Copenhagen was burnt by the British who did not approve of the concept of neutrality, the fleet was stolen, Norway was lost (to name some highlights); although there was a \"victory\" against the powerhouse that was Prussia (who soundly beat Denmark in round two in 1864). But despite these things, literature and arts were flourishing, and the focus changed to how nice and lovely a place Denmark was.

       " 'My daughter and several of my students have done undergrad dissertations over the past few years, so hopefully I can offer some guidance. It\\'d be helpful to start with if we could know more about the parameters, but the ones I\\'ve been involved with at least observing and offering guidance on have tended to require a dissertation of about 12,000 words that\\'s based chiefly on primary sources. The idea is that this is researched, typically, during a summer and written up over the course of a term that is supposed to be devoted to this purpose – you may be facing something different. But in this sort of case, typically the research portion of the work is supposed to occupy about 6-8 weeks at most and the secondary reading/writing process about another 8 weeks. This is not as much time as it seems to be. You ought to have had a significant amount of guidance before you even started the project from an academic whose main job it is to advise on choosing a practical amount of work, and a manageable topic. You seem not to have had that, but, essentially, the problem you are confronting is that you have chosen a topic that is more suitable to the sort of time available for a PhD thesis than an undergrad thesis, and even then would need be honed and focused quite a bit to make it fit. There\\'s fundamentally no way any undergrad thesis can address a topic so gargantuan as \"Thatcher\\'s policy towards the EU, 1979-1991\". You need to stop right now and consider a much more limited topic. I\\'d definitely want to start by consulting whatever undergrad handbook/guidance you may have been given about this part of your degree by your university. I think, to begin with, consider exactly what type of dissertation you are interested in. You speak of wanting to write about policy, but you\\'ve started with a deep dive into budgets and figures. To even understand what those figures are telling you, you need to take a step back and start by looking at some policy discussions. So my broad advice would be as follows: 1. Don\\'t start by going straight to the documents. You have to be able to contextualise them and at the same time you need some guidance to what\\'s available, so start with some targeted secondary reading. Read the relevant parts of Moore\\'s recent bio of Thatcher and at least a couple of specific academic studies of Britain\\'s relation with the EU in the period you are interested in. Pay special attention to the footnotes that tell you where the info in the books you\\'re reading has been drawn from. You ideally want to start by identifying a couple of key policy documents, or Thatcher speeches, that set out what her ideas and her aims were, and be reasonably confident you understand how she got to that point ... what known problems, or issues, and what known advice or arguments, she\\'d engaged with in formulating the policy she tried to put into place. And you\\'ll then need to follow through on how she went about implementing that policy, what difficulties she face, how all that influenced the way in which the policy was actually implemented, and what the differences between where she started, and where she finished, actually were, and why those changes occurred, and what sort of difference it made that they did. 2. Use all this to reduce your focus to a topic that is a manageable but also b is somewhere you can make something of an original contribution. Your suggestion of the budget rebate seems a reasonable one at first glance with respect to a but you also need to have something specific to say about it – something new. Ideally, you need to address a previously unconsidered aspect of the problem, or come up with a fresh interpretation that resolves some issue that has been discussed and disputed by other historians who have a broader focus. 3. Especially at the moment, with the problems of getting access to archives, make absolutely sure that the vast majority of what you need, if not everything you need, is going to be available to you digitally. 4. You are going about the thesis entirely wrong if you are in any way considering it as a narrative. It needs to be an argument, and it needs to be as focused on analysis, evaluation and interpretation as you can make it. It should have as little narrative to it as you can possibly manage. 5. Once you\\'ve completed a few days of secondary source reading, you ought to be in a better position to know what\\'s most interesting about the broad topic you have chosen, where the gaps in our knowledge are, and what sort of focus you might be interested in. Then narrow from there to a topic that is manageable in the time you actually have available. I\\'m sorry to hear all this is stressing you out so much and if it would help, we can talk a bit more about this on PM.',\n",
       " 'Your first question should be: was Homer a single person? This is a very thorny question on its own, since the Homeric epics were originally orally transmitted and everything about them from their date to their authorship is highly debated. For more information on the Homeric Question, here\\'s an older answer from u/telekinetic about the historical accuracy of Homer\\'s works: The tradition of Homer being blind is just one of many famous examples of blind bards (and seers, too) from the ancient world. For example, in The Odyssey, Odysseus meets the blind singer Demodocus on the island of the Phaeaecians, who sings of Odysseus\\' doings in the Trojan War and ends up causing Odysseus to reveal his true identity to the local king. Some see Demodocus as a self-referential character, representing the poet within the story. Later on in the story, we meet Tiresias, the blind prophet in the Underworld who tells Odysseus how his return home will unfold. In a literary sense, both of these characters are able to sense beyond what is directly visible and reveal the truth to those around them. The tradition extends beyond Homer as well. If you have jstor access, here\\'s an older article by Robert Dyer ( discussing an ancient Greek hymn that, in antiquity, was attributed to Homer on the basis of references to the author\\'s blindness, but that modern scholars attribute to another famous blind bard, Cynaethus of Chios. From this, we can see that later Greeks and Romans thought of Homer as a blind man, but we also see that there were multiple poets whose blindness was part of their artistic identity in early Greece. One practical reason for this might be that storytelling was a skilled and respectable occupation open to visually impaired people in the ancient world. But the idea of great poets being blind took on a greater significance than simple practicality. The blind bard became, in the words of scholar Angelica Duran, \"an ambivalent figure of alterity, bodily impairment, and creative exultation,\" (Duran 2013, 142). The trope well outlasted the Greek and Roman worlds. The 17th century poet Milton, for example, was said to see losing his eyesight as a sort of confirmation of his greatness as a poet. Here is bibliographic info for the two articles cited here, as well as a third article that discusses how the blind bard phenomenon extends from Homer into Turkish folk literature. There is a lot more out there on these topics--this is just a little taste scraped off the surface. DYER, ROBERT. “The Blind Bard of Chios (Hymn. Hom.

       " 'Greetings! This is an interesting question you have put forward, and it actually makes a fairly good point (at least on the surface) about the historical ties (or lack thereof) between Great Britain and France. There are however, also deeper reasons and causes as to why the British ended up signing the Entente Cordiale with France in 1904 (which by the way, was NOT the military alliance that some tertiary sources claim it to be, that would come in later revisions to the Dual Entente Alliance). Let\\'s begin. The German Question Before the 20th century had even dawned on Europe, the Palace of Westminster and the House of Hohenzollern had cordial and even warm relations between them. Germany\\'s Kaiser Wilhelm II often made trips to Great Britain, where he reviewed the Royal Navy and British Army, whilst also calling for a certain \"Kultur\" (culture; close tie) to develop between these two great powers. The British meanwhile, viewed Germany as a potential ally (though by no means took steps to ensure this) should Russia attempt to expand into the Balkans once more. Remember, at this stage of the late 1800s the main British concern was with their Empire, and particularly the security of both the Suez Canal and the British Raj. In the case of the former, the \"Sublime Porte\" (the Ottoman Empire) served as a useful (if at times troublesome and unstable) \"obstacle\" which the Russians had tried (and failed, though at heavy Anglo-French-Ottoman cost) to surmount in the Crimean War of 1854-56. The latter however, the \"jewel in the crown of the empire\", was also threatened by Russian expansion into Central Asia (Persia in particular, with an eye for the overland trade routes into the Indian subcontinent). As Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Prime Minister Lord Palmerston put it in 1835: \"Sooner or later, the Cossack and the Sepoy Indian soldier serving under Britain, the man from the Baltic and he from the British islands will meet in the centre of Asia. It should be our business to make sure that the meeting is as far off from our Indian possessions as may be convenient.\"^ Of course, when Prussia became Germany and quickly became a significant power in Central Europe, Russia remained a threat, constantly eyeing the Balkans (which by the late 1800s, had by some extent gained independence from their former status as Ottoman provinces). This was the atmosphere in which Germany appeared to be a reasonable option to ally with, as the French were still viewed suspiciously after the previous \"Great War\" (yes, the Napoleonic Wars were called that by the British until the First world War). However, the British were also aware that they were not particularly well viewed in Berlin either. The \"Iron Chancellor\" of Germany Otto von Bismarck often used William Gladstone\\'s Britain as \"an example of the democratic depths to which Germany might sink if they relaxed their vigilance\". The German industry and economy was also a rising threat to British commercial interests, though I highly recommend going into the specifics of this further yourself if interested. Then came a new Kaiser, Wilhelm II, and in 1890 Bismarck himself was no longer a key diplomat that either side could rely upon (having been dismissed that year by the far more aggressive-minded Wilhelm II). 1897 - Turning Point In the critical year of 1897, the Germans began to depart from their previous position as the orchestrator of the \"Concert of Europe\", and were far more imperialist in their foreign policies. Under Wilhelm II, the Germans began building their own empire abroad in Africa, the Pacific, and strengthening their economic power at home (by 1914, the furnaces and mines of Germany had already outproduced the British in steel and coal, an impressive feat). This was all done under the so-called mantra of, Weltpolitik (world politics), in which the militaristic Prussian state led Germany in becoming a Weltmacht, (world power). This was all brought to the forefront of European politicians with the following line delivered by Secretary of State of Foreign Affairs Bernhard von Bulow in December of 1897 to the German Reichstag (essentially their parliament). \"Mit einem Worte: wir wollen niemand in den Schatten stellen, aber wir verlangen auch unseren Platz an der Sonne.\" (in one word: We wish to throw no one into the shade, but we also demand our own place in the sun.).^ In this light, the British began to view the Germans with increasing suspicion. It did not help that shortly after such aggressive expansion and imperialist policies, Wilhelm II started a naval arms race with the British, something which puzzled and troubled Whitehall. After all, why did the Germans - who already possessed (at least from the British point of view) the most powerful army in the world - require an ocean-going navy? To be fair, the French were not particularly open to Britain either at this time. They were still concerned with the occupation of Egypt since the British had moved troops into the former Ottoman province in 1882. By 1904 however, that issue had mostly been settled by the French accepting that Britain would remain in Egypt for quite some time, though this new \"neighbour in North Africa\" would not threaten their own colonial holdings in French Algiers and Morocco. In 1892, the French and Russians concluded their own alliance, the Franco-Russian Alliance (I discuss this in more depth, as well as why the Germans did not ally with the Russians either, in this thread This left Britain practically isolated in terms of allies, as the Germans had already united with Austria-Hungary and Italy in the Triple Alliance. So in 1904, the British government decided that putting aside their historical rivalry and antagonism of France was the better option, and thus was born l\\'entente cordiale, with Russia joining in 1907 to form the Triple Entente, after her humiliation in the Russo-Japanese War of 1905 convinced both St. Petersburg and London that an alliance would be best to counter German-Habsburg ambitions. Conclusion So to answer OP\\'s question: the Anglo-German Alliance, though once contemplated seriously as an option for both powers, was never formally signed or negotiated due to concerns that Wilhelmine Germany, under the rhetoric of Weltpolitik, would collide with Britain and threaten the security of her empire to a larger extent (at least in the 1890s and 1900s) than either France or Russia could. Hope this helped with your question, and feel free too ask any follow-ups on related matters of international relations before World War 1.',\n",
       " \"An overtaking of the French threat with the German certainly is one of the main reasons behind Anglo-French rapprochement in the late 19th century which /u/Starwarsnerd222 has covered really well, but there were other dynamics at work too. &nbsp; Colonial Origins The British Empire in the late 19th century felt under pressure from just about everywhere — there were economic concerns at home, continued debate over home rule for Ireland, perceived French threats to Egypt and the Far East, and Russian pressure on the Northwest Frontier in Afghanistan to name just a few of the governments worries — and there simply was not either the resources or political will to deal with all of them. The British very much wanted to avoid becoming involved in a major war with another European power which could hardly afford, but also needed to ensure the protection of its colonies. Throughout the 1890s this led to mixed approaches to foriegn policy, in some cases negotiation— such as over Siam in 1896 — and in others a brinkmanship approach — such as during the Fashoda Crisis of 1898. Both policies seemed viable and there was substantial domestic debate over the best course of action. However, following the humiliating and ruinously expensive Second Boer War and with the perceived need to concentrate more on home defence with potential threats from both France and Germany nearby the isolationist urge to enforce British policy rather than negotiate it was increasingly discredited. Accordingly, a diplomatic agreement that could offer long term security for Britain’s colonies became increasingly attractive. Infact, the actual text of the Entente Cordiale which would be the basis for later cooperation, is largely spent adjudicating colonial disputes. Meanwhile on the other side of the Channel, the main problem for French foreign policy from the formation of Germany in 1871 right the way till 1940 was that of security and as a rule she was generally eager to seek out allies to help ensure it. In the case of the late 19th century the French foreign minister at the time very much favored building a relationship with Great Britain as a safeguard against German aggression and pushed heavily for peaceful solutions to colonial troubles and the general easing of tensions described above. So, a situation developed where Britain needed to reduce the chance of conflict along her Imperial borders and France was willing to make concessions to do so in return for improved relations. &nbsp; Russia and the Rise of Military Partnership In understanding how a limited treaty mostly concerning colonial matters into a guarantee of security we need to look at Russia. The 1904-5 Russo-Japanese War profoundly weakened the perception of Russia's capability and thereby also weakened her role in the Franco-Russian alliance as a counterweight to Germany For a decade, until 1904-5, the Franco-Russian alliance, alongside the German-led Triple Alliance, had been the key variable in the calculations of the chancelleries of Europe. The alliance acted as a kind of vice on Germany, restricting the latter's diplomatic freedom of manoeuvre in Europe...In 1905 the Franco-Russian Dual Alliance was effectively disabled: the vice had cracked open. - T. G. Otte, ‘“Almost a Law of Nature”? Sir Edward Grey, the Foreign Office, and the Balance of Power in Europe, 1905-12’, Diplomacy & Statecraft, 14.2 , p. 82. The same year Germany sparked the First Moroccan Crisis as part of the Weltpoltik discussed elsewhere. Without the assurance of Russian support the British worried the French would seek a settlement with the Germans which would greatly endanger British interests, so Britain felt compelled to support France. Lord Grey, the foreign minister, made hinted to the French that, while he could not promise anything more than neutrality in the event of a war public opinion might force Britain’s hand and authorized informal planning talks with the French military attache. Though this didn’t result in any firm commitments it did represent a fundamental shift in British policy going forward. The new common thinking in British foreign policy can be summarized fairly easily: If, however, the entente were allowed to collapse, Britain would be internationally isolated, and thus vulnerable to pressure by other powers. Sir Charles Hardinge, the permanent undersecretary, endorsed Grey's argument: 'If France is left in the lurch an agreement or an alliance between France, Germany and Russia in the near future is certain. This ... is the Kaiser's ideal, France and Russia becoming satellites within the German system.' If,however, the entente remained intact, then Britain's position as the linchpin of European politics would also be secure - T. G. Otte, ‘“Almost a Law of Nature”?

DISCLAIMER: I am not saying this is the only reason Britain entered WWI, that is a much bigger topic than can be discussed here &nbsp; Conclusion While concern over the rise of Germany certainly helped drive Britain and France together the need to settle colonial questions also played a large role and was, perhaps, the only purpose of the improved relationship in 1904. However, the removal of Russia as a force able to check German ambitions drove Britain to step into the gap and tie herself to French Security. &nbsp; Follow Up Answer - Monarchy, Democracy and Republics I can also shed some light on your follow up question on why a conservative monarchy and a revolutionary republic might work together. In the period being discussed the United Kingdom was a constitutional monarchy and while the sovereign had more power, both official and simply by way of influence, than today their role was much closer to our modern understanding of the royalty than the power their ancestors wielded in earlier centuries. Britain saw itself as a democracy and saw the German Empire very much as a militaristic and totalitarian state. Indeed, Prussianism virtually became a synonym for such things. By contrast, the French Republic was a liberal democracy similar to the UK.

       " 'They did indeed! Unfortunately, we only know a few examples. The Seleucid king Antiochus I had elephants named Patroclus and Ajax (after, of course, the heroes of the Iliad). Unfortunately - at least if we can believe Pliny - Ajax came to a sad end: \"When Antiochus was sounding the ford of a river, an elephant named Ajax, which on other occasions had always led the rest, refused to enter the stream...But another elephant called Patroclus hazarded the stream, and as a reward, the king presented it with some silver pendants, a kind of ornament with which these animals are particularly delighted...Upon this, the elephant that had been degraded refused to take its food, and so preferred death to ignominy.\" (Natural History, 8.12) Among the elephants of King Pyrrhus was an animal named Nikon (\"Victor\"), who became famous for his loyalty. In the midst of a furious street battle, when his driver was wounded and fell from his seat, Nikon scooped the man up with his trunk, laid him across his tusks, and charged to safety, trampling all in his path (Plutarch, Pyrrhus 33.4-5). Probably the most famous of all classical war elephants, however, was Surus (\"The Syrian\"), Hannibal\\'s lead elephant. (Incidentally, I have an older answer on Hannibal\\'s elephants that might interest you.) This remarkable animal was Hannibal\\'s mount for years, and carried him as he suffered from the fever that blinded one of his eyes (Livy 22.2). You might be interested in my old video on classical war elephants, which provides more detail on their training and uses in combat.',\n",

       " \"I will leave the discussion of the relative significance of the Emperor's research and discoveries to actual marine biologists. But to answer the first part of the question, yes, Hirohito did publish his research both during his life, and some was published posthumously. In terms of recognition for his contributions to science, Hirohito granted an elected Fellowship of the Royal Society in 1971. Much of his research was centered around observations of different species of Hydrozoa published under the aegis of the Laboratory on Imperial grounds in which Hirohito had researched biology since he was a young man in the company of the lab's director and biologist Dr. Hirotaro Hattori. Much of his life's research including the samples he collected and analyzed as well as his original observations now comprise the Showa Memorial Institute (Showa being Hirohito's posthumous name) as part of Japan's National Museum of Nature and Science. My primary source for this was the biographical memoir/obituary for Hirohito published in the memoirs of the Royal Society written by noted botanist Edred John Henry Corner which I would recommend reading for a far more in-depth account of Hirohito's life in science as told by a peer from his field.

       " 'Aquatic biologist here (I do both marine and freshwater work). I never interacted directly with the Emperor Showa, but have one degree of academic separation from him, so I can make a few comments. Maybe someone who actually collaborated with him can weigh in later, although I think most of them have retired and may not be active on Reddit. He was a legitimate biologist, and did taxonomic work both on slime molds (which are terrestrial) and hydrozoans (think, jellyfish), and also published several florulas (accounts of the plants present in a particular region) for imperial properties. His interest was genuine, so this was more than just an idle pass-time for him; I think it is legitimate to say that he would have been a professional naturalist and systematist had he not had the inconvenient circumstances of being a god-emperor by birth. Now, the real question from OP was whether or not he made scientifically important discoveries. I want to give a little pushback on the premise of the question, because it can be very difficult to assess any individual’s impact. We have a kind of a cult of the lone genius scientist, and while there are certainly people who make outsized contributions, there is also a lot of journeyman science which isn’t super exciting in and of itself but is incredibly valuable long-term and should not be dismissed as idle entertainment or ‘stamp collecting’. A lot of taxonomic work is in this category. So, there has certainly never been his equal in the taxonomy of slime molds of the Imperial Palace of Japan. Is this your priority for discovery? Maybe not, but as we experience a climate change/mass extinction event of a scale that has been matched only a handful of times in the history of the planet, having baseline, detailed floristic information on particular locations makes it possible to assess the impact of climate change in a way that would otherwise not be possible. Consequently, his work has the potential to be really useful in the future, if someone follows up on it. I should also note that his work on slime molds substantially helped the development of Dictyostelium as a model system, which may well be his most important contribution to date. His marine work was largely on hydrozoans; he did careful taxonomic work and collected extensively in Sagami Bay. This is important for the same reason I gave above, and more specifically because it documents the biota of Sagami Bay, so is a valuable tool for resource management. Again, not super sexy, but important. I tried a little to figure out what his impact factor or H-index would be, but because he published under a few different names and because many of his publications were in the Japanese-language scientific press, I wasn’t able to come up with anything that I would regard as a reliable metric. I think it is safe to say, however, that he was much more than a hobbyist, and did careful and well-informed research within his discipline. His publications are taken seriously, and his work will probably be referred to for its scientific content for years to come. Regarding what name he used to publish, some of his publications just say “The Emperor Hirohito,” but he also used a pseudonym, H. Hattori, e.g., Hattori H 1964 Myxomycetes of the Nasu District 1st and 2nd edn (Tokyo: Science Council of Japan) Unfortunately most of the publications I can find are behind firewalls, but here is a memorial essay that talks a little about his accomplishments',\n",
       " \"Unfortunately not. Nakamura, who was indeed from Taiwan, and was a member of the aboriginal ethnic minority on the island whom the Japanese considered likely to be loyal to them, and opposed to the Chinese, was only occasionally forthcoming about his experiences, and he died only five years after emerging from the jungle. He was not well-educated, was an enlisted man, and had not actively sought to fight on after 1945, being concerned merely with his personal survival – while Onoda was an officer, n implacable resister, and hence a major celebrity at the time of his return to Japan, all of which perhaps explains why he so quickly produced his book. He served mainly on the Indonesian island of Morotai. I covered Nakamura's story (along with those of other Japanese holdouts) in some detail in a long essay that you can read here if you're interested in the subject as a whole. He is most interesting on the ways in which the Taiwanese members of his unit interacted with the Japanese. There are a lot of unexplained features relating to his long stay on Morotai – he did not spend the whole of the period alone, and the extent to which he was known to, and associated with, the indigenous islanders remains a bit of a puzzle, too. But if you are solely interested in Nakamura, this is what I had to say about him. Sources are at the foot of the original essay: Nakamura had grown up in Formosa (Taiwan) – then a Japanese possession that had been seized from China at the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95. Born in 1923, he was a member of the indigenous aboriginal peoples who by then comprised only a small minority of the island’s population. His real name, it appears, was Attun Palalin, but he adopted a Japanese one when he was conscripted (or volunteered; there seems to be no consensus here) and joined the war effort in 1943. After completing basic training, he was sent with his unit to the Indonesian island of Morotai a few months before it was attacked by the advancing Americans. Nakamura, then, was not Japanese, and he and his comrades occupied an at best marginal position in the Imperial Army’s order of battle. One of his motives for joining up in the first place – to fight in a war that only about 8,500 Taiwanese took a direct part in – may have been to elevate his status; indigenous men who joined the Imperial forces ranked above the local Chinese in the eyes of the island’s administrators. But it was a decision that also placed him in a position of considerable danger. Taiwan’s “special volunteer soldiers” were earmarked by their Japanese superiors to spearhead dangerous missions, and expended as cannon fodder in some of the bloodiest battles of the war. As Trefalt points out, Nakamura’s very survival “thus inescapably brought into the public sphere the legacies of Japanese imperialism.” The wartime choices forced on Nakamura’s unit were similar to those made by many other IJA troops confronting Allied landings on small islands. Forced to make the best of limited supplies, faced by overwhelming numbers, and lacking proper air support, they either sacrificed themselves in hopeless attempts at defence, or retreated into the interior. Morotai – an island of about 700 square miles, five times the size of Onoda’s Lubang – was large enough to make the latter option a realistic one, and Nakamura was fortunate that his unit was ordered to disperse and commence a guerilla campaign soon after the invasion happened. By the time the war actually ended, 11 months later, he was part of a dwindling group of soldiers that seems to have repeatedly dispersed and coalesced, breaking into ever smaller parties to hunt for food deep in the jungle, and regularly losing members to starvation and disease. According to the survivors of one of these small parties – nine men who were discovered and repatriated in 1956 – Nakamura possessed a high degree of self-sufficiency. He went off to live on his own in the jungle between 1946 and 1947, returned to the main group in 1950, and then disappeared again a few years later. It was generally supposed by the other troops that Nakamura had died somewhere in the jungle. In fact he survived and lived on alone, catching fish in the rivers, maintaining his rifle (but not using it to hunt for fear of being heard and found by local people), and eventually settling down in a remote cleft in Morotai’s southern mountains. There he gradually hacked out a clearing in the rainforest in which he could cultivate red peppers, bananas, taro and paw-paw. It is difficult to know quite how alone Nakamura was during these years. Some local testimony suggests that he continued to roam in search of food to supplement his diet, and was spotted in the jungle from time to time – a distant figure, all but naked on a hillside. Planes from an Indonesian air base on Morotai also overflew the jungle on occasion, and, over the years, their pilots logged evidence of human activity in some oddly remote areas. But knowledge of the possible existence of Japanese stragglers on the island remained confined to the base until the worldwide publicity that accompanied Onoda’s surrender in 1974 jogged some memories, and word of the pilots’ sightings at last reached the members of a Bureau of Repatriate Welfare bone-collecting mission that called at Morotai late in the same year. Word was passed to the Japanese embassy in Jakarta, and thence to Tokyo, which formally requested the help of the Indonesian government. It proved to be not too difficult to pinpoint Nakamura’s position from the air, but actually reaching his clearing on foot was a different proposition. It took the men of an Indonesian army unit three days to trek through the jungle from the nearest road, and – confronted by an unknown adversary who was quite possibly armed – they chose to adopt some unorthodox tactics when approaching him. The 11 soldiers who reached what would be dubbed “Nakamura City” on the morning of 18 December 1974 had made careful preparations for their encounter with the lonely soldier. They had memorised the words of the Japanese national anthem – which they sang in unison as they emerged from the jungle – and, in addition, had equipped themselves with a photo of a geisha. (They were not the only ones to assume that a man who had spent years alone in the jungle would be interested in women; Norio Suzuki had gone to Lubang equipped with a small stock of softcore pornography, which he attempted to share with Onoda – an offer that his quarry brusquely rejected.) As things turned out, however, there was no need for touches such as these. Nakamura – who was “painfully thin and plainly terrified” – offered no resistance, though, like Yokoi, he seems to have remained convinced for several days that he faced execution on his extraction from the jungle. Nakamura was taken to Jakarta and hospitalised. Indonesians, meanwhile, woke to newspaper reports that made much of the ingenuity he had displayed in surviving for so long. He had built himself a sturdy shack, and carved a rough map of his surroundings on a stone; he had attempted to tame a wild boar and a moleyu bird for company. According to the people of Dehegila, the jungle village closest to his base, he had even made friends with a local hunter, who occasionally brought him gifts of salt and sugar. In time, the villagers would erect a statue to commemorate Nakamura’s life on Morotai, remembering him as “the good Japanese,” who, during his first weeks in the jungle, had rescued a local girl when she was attacked by other members of his unit. For much of the rest of the world, however, Japan’s final straggler was something of a disappointment. Nakamura’s robust self-sufficiency was admirable in its own way, but it paled in contrast to Onoda’s nearly 30 years of active service, and he possessed nothing of the Japanese lieutenant’s flair for the dramatic, or his ease in front of the world’s press. It was even difficult to decide who, precisely, Nakamura was. By the time that he walked out of the jungle, history had rendered him effectively stateless. The Japanese empire that he had served was long defunct. Taiwan had become the seat of a Chinese nationalist government. And though he himself expressed a wish to be “repatriated” to Japan, he had never been there, and – it emerged – had no right to live there, either. Of all the stragglers who staggered from bolt-holes across the Pacific in the years 1945-1974, then, Teruo Nakamura was the most marginal and the hardest to categorise. But if Hiroo Onoda was interesting largely for his dogged adherence to a state, a mindset and a way of life that had vanished in the 1940s, Nakamura stands as a sort of mirror image of him. His story is worth telling less for what he did during his long years in the jungle than for what his emergence meant for 1970s Japan.\",\n",
       " 'Hi, Difficult question. Which type of castle? around centuries the concept has changed. So, you can find an isolated castle or a fortified city. I suppose that you mean the first, the simple castle. I suppose that owner nobleman sells the castle to another nobleman. The possession of castle can also implicate (not always) the administration of justice (until modern age) and rents for the cultivation of land. Consider that in late middle ages feudalism was not so stronger like in the “full” period and feudal lord lose power in front of the burghers, because the society goes to a monetary society (before was also in more part agriculture. Few money and barter). In addition, in many parts of Europe around XVI-XVII century a new noblesse was born. Not a feudal and warrior noblesse like middle ages but a category related with administration of the state, very rich and can buy castles, lands, propriety and noblesse patents. This happens because with the military revolution in Renaissance feudal lords also lose power in front of the state, represented in the figure of “prince”. In this military revolution the army (that is more largely and include poor men, not only military noblesse with armour and horse) is raised and controlled by the prince with is money, and there is no need that military noblesse raises his host. Resume: I suppose that the castle’s market reflects the evolution of the society and economy. With a more economic society and the flourish of commerce and later industrialisation medieval warrior noblesse lost his power because they don’t have money (they don’t work, only take the rents for the cultivation of land). With this mentality it’s difficult to maintain a castle and pay taxes. So, after centuries they are economically ruined.',\n",
       " 'Maya cities would certainly be surrounded by maize fields. Their absence from a reconstruction of a city probably has more to do with avoiding extraneous detail than any larger statement about Maya social organisation. As for the actual techniques used, well the Maya had a lot of them. Much like many other American civilisations, the Maya practiced polyculture, the particular Mesoamerican variant known today as the milpa. In areas with less population density the Maya used slash-and-burn agriculture, also known as swidden. This form of agriculture can be productive. However, due to soil exhaustion, the land has to be rotated through fallow after a few years, and consequently it needs a lot of space. So, not ideal for large cities. Fortunately, the Maya had a lot of other techniques they could use. These included terraces, irrigation canals, raised fields, and bajos, or man-made swamps that could be harvested for fertiliser. In addition, they had several other types of farming, such as silviculture (tree agriculture) which helped them to maximise space. In fact, silviculture was so prominent among the Classic Maya that it is possible to identify where Maya sites used to be simply by looking at the tree species. If you find a lot of fruit and nut trees, there is a good chance a Maya settlement is close by.

       " 'Greetings! How fortunate that this question is one that I\\'ve been studying and reading about as befitting for my area of research (and flair). It is somewhat interesting, especially when one considers it (as no doubt OP has in the preamble of their question), why the Germans and Russians did not form an alliance in the waning years of the 1800s or even the early years of the 1900s. The answer however, is actually tad more complicated and requires us to get acquainted with some historical context (of course it does). Let\\'s begin. For a time, there was indeed a Russo-German Alliance, or, to be more specific, the Dreikaiserbund (League of the Three Emperors) not only between Russia and Germany, but also with Austria-Hungary. This formal alliance came into being in 1881, and it was the brainchild of that master of realpolitik, Otto von Bismarck. Bismarck knew all too well that if he wished to maintain Germany\\'s position in Central Europe and keep the balance of peace (which was always sketchy during that time period, especially with constant flare-ups over the Balkans), he needed to secure the goodwill of Tsar Alexander III. The Tsar for his part, trusted Bismarck, for the Iron Chancellor had no reason to go against Russian claims of influence in the Baltic. To him, the Balkans were a constant thorn in the side of European peace, and he personally did not wish to drag Germany into a scuffle with Russia over this matter. In fact, Alexander III and his advisers believed that Germany could actually be relied upon to oppose Austro-Hungarian expansionism in the Balkans, for the Habsburg monarchy was often the archrival \"Great Power\" to the Romanov dynasty when it came to Eastern Europe. Bismarck made constant reassurances to Alexander III that despite the existence of the Triple Alliance (between Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy), Russia would not be the target or an obstacle in any of their foreign policies. He did so by continually renewing the Dreikaiserbund, with Article 2 of the Reinsurance Treaty of 1887 going so far as to state that: Germany recognizes the rights historically acquired by Russia in the Balkan Peninsula, and particularly the legitimacy of her preponderant and decisive influence in Bulgaria and in Eastern Rumelia. The two Courts engage to admit no modification of the territorial status quo of the said peninsula without a previous agreement between them, and to oppose, as occasion arises, every attempt to disturb this status quo or to modify it without their consent.^ These are very powerful words, but already by 1885 cracks were already forming between these two countries. In that year, Bulgaria had broken loose of the Tsar\\'s control, asserting independence and coming into a bloody war with Serbia. Austria-Hungary intervened to protect Serbia, demanding that Bulgaria step down or face a new enemy. That Germany did not take steps to halt Austro-Hungarian manoeuvres (which Alexander III likely saw as \"excuses\" for greater Habsburg control of the Balkans) fomented the seeds of mistrust which would later flower at the end of the 1880s. In March of 1888, Kaiser Wilhelm I, whom Tsar Alexander III had seen as an equal in the great dynastic houses of Europe, passed away. His successor, Wilhelm II, was not accorded the same respect. Bismarck was also nearing the end of his tenure, being dismissed in 1890. That removal of the one key linchpin in the Russo-German friendship spelled doom for relations between the two countries, and drew Russia closer to France\\'s orbit. Interestingly, it was also Great Britain which drew Russia closer to France, and particularly the fear of a rapprochement (a cooling in relations) between the two. France, for its part, was becoming more stable and more militarily capable, signs which Alexander III viewed as ideal conditions to begin exploring the possibility of an alliance with this other European power. Further still, the new German Chancellor Leo von Caprivi refused to renew the Reinsurance Treaty when the time came in 1890, signalling Germany\\'s move towards imperialism and Russian antagonism. All the while Kaiser Wilhelm II began talks and visits to practically all of Russia\\'s major rivals: the Ottoman Empire and its sultan, the British Empire and its queen, as well as the Italians and their king. To Alexander III, these were clear signs that Germany was favouring its Triple Alliance far more than Bismarck would have preferred it to, and now that the old statesman was gone, there would be little to stop the Germans from turning their sights on Eastern expansion. As the 1890s progressed, the French were also far more willing than the Germans to provide credit and capital for the modernization of Russia\\'s industry and army, two things which Alexander III believed he desperately needed if a war was forthcoming. In Germany meanwhile, the Kaiser was now supporting a new imperialist outlook on the world, in the foreign policy of Weltpolitik (world politics), which advocated for Germany\\'s rise not just as a continental hegemon of Europe, but also as a Weltmacht (world power). Historian Michael Howard on this pride in the imperialist system: It the German Empire had every reason to be ambitious. It constituted a nation over sixty million strong with a superb heritage of music, poetry, and philosophy, and whose scientists, technologists, and scholars (not to mention soldiers) were the envy of the world... The Germans prided themselves on a uniquely superior culture that held the balance between the despotic barbarism of their eastern neighbours and the decadent democracy of the West.\"^ This was all brought to the forefront of European politicians with the following line delivered by Secretary of State of Foreign Affairs Bernhard von Bulow in December of 1897 to the German Reichstag (essentially their parliament). \"Mit einem Worte: wir wollen niemand in den Schatten stellen, aber wir verlangen auch unseren Platz an der Sonne.\" (in one word: We wish to throw no one into the shade, but we also demand our own place in the sun.).^ With Germany no longer being so cordial to Russia, it seemed that a Franco-Russian Alliance was now the best (and perhaps only) option for the Tsar. Such an alliance was formed in 1892, to later to be joined by Britain (who was also gradually growing weary of Germany\\'s naval projects and colony-hunting). Hope this response helps, and incase you\\'re curious about it, here\\'s a shameless plug to another response I made on the decline of Austro-Hungarian-Russian relations in the 1800s (as unlike Germany, this was a far more rapid and astounding break of relations).

       " 'To understand this, we need to understand the difference between the claim that Bengal had a prosperous manufacturing sector, and the claim that they were \"showing signs of industrialisation,\" or that Bengal \"was going to industrialise.\" The first is an uncontroversial claim that Bengal had a substantial manufacturing sector. Artisanal cottons and silks were produced in large volumes, and were famously traded internationally as one of the great luxury goods. There was also a substantial shipbuilding industry, as well as gunpowder manufacture. In some ways, this mix of industries is not so dissimilar to the Netherlands, or to England itself, in the 17th century, or indeed the urban economies of the mid-Song dynasty in China at its peak. And it meant that the urban areas of Bengal were relatively prosperous, at least until the disasters of the mid-18th century, culminating in the EIC takeover. By the standards of the early modern period, this was a major centre of manufacturing and trade. But then, so was the Netherlands, and a hundred years after the beginning of the industrial revolution, they had fallen well behind Britain, Germany, and France. Pre-modern prosperity does not necessarily imply imminent industrialisation. What is unclear is how Bengali artisanal manufacturing would lead to industrialisation in the sense of a one-way transformation of the economy away from subsistence and into persistent growth driven by technological change. Textiles manufacturing and (wooden) shipbuilding are skilled crafts, but they do not lead to the replacement of human and animal power with machine power fuelled by combustion, which was the genuinely revolutionary part of the industrial revolution. Had Britain only invented spinning jennies and flying shuttles and so on, it might have led to an export boom in textiles, but it wouldn\\'t have led to a fundamental lifting of pre-modern constraints. The real transformation was the application of fossil fuels (coal, most prominently), the invention of the steam engine, blast furnaces for producing iron and eventually steel, and the beginnings of mass production rather than artisanal production. The origins of this change in Britain are still debated, but the two prevailing theories are Allen\\'s factor prices argument: that labour was expensive and capital was cheap, which incentivised the invention, and more importantly adoption, of machinery, and Mokyr\\'s culture of growth argument, that the seeds of technological change are found in the slow but profound diffusion of scientific ideas, and the social structures necessary to apply those ideas to the problems of production. Bengali skilled artisans were skilled and well-compensated, but wages for ordinary workers were generally quite low, especially outside the cities, and the cost of capital was quite high. There was little incentive to innovate labour-saving methods that involved complex machinery, as workers were relatively cheap, and machines were expensive. The culture of science and technology arguments are more ambiguous. I would be interested to read a good work on the state of the Bengali culture of science and technology during the Mughal period, and I am sympathetic to the argument that existing arguments about \"why not India\" from the European side have been more dismissive than detailed. But I am unaware of any argument that Bengal was integrated into a flourishing web of scientific research and dissemination of knowledge in the way Britain clearly was by the 17th century. Bengali artisans certainly possessed plenty of knowledge of both the technical and artistic parts of their trades, to the point where their methods and aesthetics were widely copied. But the overall mechanisation was at a sophisticated but still pre-industrial revolution level even in textiles. There doesn\\'t seem to be much evidence of emerging development in other areas. We do not know all the contributing components as to why these things occurred in Britain, but we have some fair guesses; very few of these likely prerequisites can be found in Bengal, despite its prosperous artisanal manufacturing sector. Bengal has exploitable coal deposits, but they were not used until the colonial period. Perhaps they were not necessary, but neither could they play any immediate part in a supposed incipient industrial revolution (but for colonial rule). A Bengali industrial revolution would have required much more than just higher incomes and innovations in the handicrafts sector. It would have required steam engines, blast furnaces, railroads, and factories. And to create those things, it likely would have required agricultural innovations to sustain ever-increasing urbanisation; the educational, scientific and technological resources to generate a constant flow of improvements and inventions both at the practical and theoretical level; a state able to impose both internal and external stability and yet mostly refrain from excessive appropriation or taxation of any early economic successes. (Or perhaps, in deference to the colonial plunder argument, to do the excessive appropriation and taxation halfway around the world instead of at home. I don\\'t think this was the critical factor, but if one thinks it was, then it is not very clear how Bengal would have replicated it.)',\n",
       " 'Greetings! Unfortunately you have hit on a rather obscure question here, and one whose historiography is either mostly in German, Dutch, far too old to find online, or a combination of the three. Let\\'s see what light I can shed however, based on the limited English and somewhat more up-to-date publications on the matter. The first reason is pretty simple: the Netherlands was the country chosen for Wilhelm II for lack of a better choice. Switzerland in the south was deemed too international and too diplomatic in its political atmosphere. Not to mention the small fact that getting the Kaiser there would mean either crossing enemy lines in war (not something you want to do with a head of state), or traversing German districts which were heavily influenced by left-wing rebels (or so at least, it was reported). Belgium was out of the question, because it was still possible that Allied troops would push further and threaten the Kaiser with capture (or worse) before the war ended. Denmark and the Scandinavian countries would necessitate long voyages (and in the case of Norway, a dangerous naval trip through the British blockade, which would almost certainly catch the Kaiser\\'s entourage). Holland at least, still had a monarch in the figure of Queen Wilhelmina, who was also (helpfully) a distant relation of Wilhelm II by way of the House of Orange (the Dutch royal family tree which had German relatives in the house of Hohenzollern). From the German army headquarters in Spa (Belgium), to the Dutch border, a distance of about thirty to forty miles was all that the Kaiser had to negotiate, much if not all of it controlled by disciplined German troops already. As for why the Netherlands allowed Wilhelm to stay in-exile there, the reasons are a mix of royal ties between Queen Wilhelmina and Wilhelm II, as well as \"the Dutch tradition of hospitality and asylum\", though the civilians did not share this opinion of the abdicated Kaiser. When the royal procession stopped at Eijsden station on the way to exile, the Kaiser endured about an hour\\'s worth of shouts from Belgian refugees and locals. Common phrases heard (as recored by eyewitnesses) were: (and I apologise for such foul language, but all in the name of historical narrative) schweinhund (bastard), mörder (killer), and the somewhat satirical Kaiser, wohin? Nach Paris? (Kaiser where? To Paris? - likely a jab at Wilhelm\\'s dream of marching through Paris in 1914). Upon arriving at Maarn station in the province of Utrecht, the Kaiser was received by Godard Bentick, Graaf van Aldenburg-Bentick (member of a distinguished Anglo-German-Dutch family), who housed him at the estate in Amerongen for three days. Such was the atmosphere and rationale (as far as my source-work and research, limited by lack of current focus on the matter in academic circles) for the Kaiser\\'s choice of exile. Hope this somewhat helps, and sorry for the lack of further detail! Sources Howard, Michael. The First World War: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press, 2007.

       " \"I think you should compare the Vietnam war not with the US civil war but with the US independence wars (or any other country's independence war). Prior to US intervention, Vietnamese were fighting an indepenence war against France. Making a broad list of events: Indochina (French colony in today's Vietnam) at the beginning of the XX century was experiencing troubles and revolution movements as any other colony was at that time. In 1940 the Japanese Empire took many cities and positions in the country, showing the inability of France to defend the country (via diplomacy or arms). Irregular local forces were formed to fight the japanese invaders In 1944, while the local forces were still fighting the japanese in the north of the country, the french started taking territory back. When the japanese were finally defeated, these local forces turned to fight the french again. In 1954 the french are finally defeated and Ho chi minh is declared president. It was planned to have elections in the country, but as Ho chi minh was the likely winner, the CIA backed a military coup in the south. (The exterior policy of the US seems to be: you are free to choose as long as you choose what I want). So, going back to the US example, let's make the following made up scenario: The US fights the english and somehow win without the help from the french. Right after the war is over there are going to be elections and Washington is likely to be the winner (with around an 80% of the votes). So then comes France and as they don't like it, so they support a coup that prevents the national elections and splits the country. I guess that most of americans would endure hardships and war to follow their national hero against a new colonizer. Something like this happened in Vietnam.\",\n",
       " \"My specific area of expertise is that of the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy, so I will focus on them. I'm afraid I can't offer more general comment as to how Brandenburg-Prussia or another Imperial Estate would have administered its territories outside of the Empire, but hopefully another flair with a wider array of experience than me can come along to try and examine it. Now, of course, questions involving the HRE involve a time period of nearly a thousand years, and of course, things will be different if we're discussing the Holy Roman Empire of the Ottonians in the 10th century, or the Habsburgs in the 16th. Again, my experience is limited, so I will primarily be talking about how the Austrian Habsburgs organised their realm in the early modern period, primarily looking at the latter half of the 17th century, after the conclusion of the Thirty Years War. Looking at a map of the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy we can see that the core territories of the monarchy within the empire are the Archduchy of Austria itself and the Kingdom of Bohemia (each of which in turn consisted of a large number of constituent territories). Perhaps the key distinction between territories within and without the Empire was the combination of loyalty to the Emperor, as well as a certain number of rights and privileges accorded to Princes of the Empire under the imperial constitution that would not be granted to non-Imperial estates. I've gone into more detail on the differences between imperial and non-Imperial territories here At the highest levels, the Habsburgs effectively maintained two distinct organs for diplomacy, one for policy within the Empire and another for diplomacy without. Outside the boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire, the Habsburgs also claimed the title of King of Hungary, though prior to the Great Turkish War, Habsburg rule was limited to the relatively narrow stretch of land termed Royal Hungary. Yet, how did we arrive at this situation? Unsurprisingly for the House of Habsburg, their claims to the Kingdom of Hungary rested on diplomacy. In 1526, Hungary and Bohemia were both ruled by King Louis II of Hungary, a member of the House of Jagiellon. An important thing to remember is that, much like the HRE as a whole, both the Kingdom of Hungary and the Kingdom of Bohemia were elective monarchies. Kingship did not automatically pass to the eldest son, but rather, on the death of a King, the assembled nobles of the Kingdom would elect a new King. Normally, of course, this would be the son of the current King, but--much like in the Holy Roman Empire--the politicking to ensure the election of the desired candidate provided the nobility a powerful balance against the authority of the monarch. This was a fiercely guarded privilege and the claims of Bohemian nobility to elect their own ruler was a key step that led to the outbreak of the Thirty Years War, but I'm going off on a bit of a tangent. Back to King Louis II and 1526. In 1526, King Louis II was killed in the Battle of Mohacs, waged against the Ottoman Empire. Louis II died childless, and had no clear heir. To add to the confusion, the defeat at Mohacs had seen the main Hungarian army completely destroyed, and the Ottomans soon marched on the capital of Buda. Prior to the conflict, there had been a serious divide in the Hungarian nobility, between a pro-Habsburg part centred around many of the senior nobility and clergy, and an anti-Habsburg part focused around lesser nobility and Protestants. These two groups would go on to elect two different Kings of Hungary. The high nobility would give the crown to Ferdinand of Austria (younger brother of Charles V and future Holy Roman Emperor), while the lesser nobility would do the same for the Voivode of Transylvania, John Zapolya. Eventually, Hungary would be partitioned in three, with the Habsburgs taking a strip of land along their own frontiers that would come to be known as Royal Hungary, the Ottomans occupied central Hungary, while the rival Kings of Hungary would ultimately consolidate their power base into a new Principality of Transylvania. As far as administration, Habsburg rule over Hungary and Croatia was indeed quite different from their own rule over their own Austrian or even Bohemian territories, but as much of this was due to the decentralised nature of early modern administration as a whole. It's important to remember that most early modern polities were not unified states, despite how they appear on the map. Many are what we would call composite monarchies, with a variety of different territories (each which their own sets of traditions and laws) united under the rule of a single monarch. This distinction is highly important when we consider Habsburg rule over non-Imperial territories, as--in Hungary--the Habsburgs did not rule as Holy Roman Emperor, but rather as King of Hungary. As to the administration of these realms, rule of an early modern polity is far different from what we might imagine today. There was no central bureaucracy responsible for promulgating and enforcing decisions made by the head of state. Rather, enforcement of royal (or even Imperial) decrees was heavily reliant on cooperation with local nobles and other such individuals (usually called the Provincial Estates) who would actually be able to do whatever it was the Emperor in Vienna had asked of them. Thus, Habsburg rule was a constant balancing act between the Provincial Estates and the Emperor as to how much would be done. To give an example, while it might be quite easy to convince the Provincial Estates to vote for taxes meant to raise an army to defend their lands, it would be much harder to convince them to do the same for an aggressive campaign that might not involve them. This was as true for territories outside the Empire as it was within. So, to summarise, it was hardly surprising to see a non-Imperial territory be ruled by a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire. However, the importance of the composite monarchy and the difficulties in realm wide administration cannot be overstated. Hopefully, this has helped to answer your question. Please feel free to ask any follow ups.\",\n",
       " 'I can\\'t speak on Lenin\\'s specific decisions, but it was quite common for the Bolsheviks to adopt new pen names: Joseph Stalin was born Jughashvili (or Dzhugashvili if you transliterate from Russian), Leon Trotsky was born Lev Bronstein, Vyacheslav Molotov was born Skryabin, and there were likely more that I\\'m forgetting. Now the one thing you may notice about the individuals I mentioned is that most of them had quite prominent non-Russian names (Jughashvili is Georgian, while Bronstein was Jewish). This was one of the main reasons they adopted new names, though the need to conceal their identity from the authorities was also a major one: Stalin, for example, had multiple pen names before settling on his most famous one. As to how they adopted these names, it stemmed from a variety of sources. The most common theory for Lenin is that it derived from the Lena River, which is out in Siberia near where he was exiled for a time. Stalin\\'s comes from the Russian word for steel (Сталь, stal\\'), modified to mean \"man of steel\". Trotsky claims his name came from a cellmate in jail; the name itself means someone from the city of Troki (Trakai in Lithuania). Molotov\\'s name comes from the Russian word for hammer (молот), and so on. Now as to why they didn\\'t simply go back to being Ulyanov, Jughashvili, Bronstein and so on? That is difficult to say, but considering they had been using these names for years by 1922, decades even, and had risen to fame both within the Party and to the public, it would seem redundant to do so. To the wider world V.I. Ulyanov was Lenin, and while people knew his \"real\" name (and indeed correspondence between Bolsheviks used it on occasion), it wouldn\\'t make any difference to go back to it. I\\'d even go so far as to say this was doubly true for Stalin and Trotsky: they had distinctively non-Russian names, and while there was a lot of non-Russians in the USSR and within the Party (as they clearly demonstrate), it made things easier for everyone to have Russian names. I\\'d even further note that for someone like Stalin (who I\\'ll admit I\\'m far more familiar with), he was no longer Jughashvili by that point, a Georgian socialist, but instead was now Stalin, an international Bolshevik. His old identity and name was no longer him, and while he was never denied his Georgian heritage, he saw himself as someone beyond that. Whether that is true for Lenin and Trotsky, and others, I can\\'t say though, but I think it can give some insight into how they felt.',\n",
       " 'On the surface, not very. As you said, in the wake of the Conquest of 1066, the English nobility was almost wholly replaced by a new Norman - or Frankish - elite, and of course William and his sons displaced the English line of succession which should have seen the throne go to the young Eadgar Ætheling. This straightforward \\'fact\\' belies a more nuanced situation however: The Normans were nothing if not adept at integration. Of the English nobles killed at Hastings, many left behind widows, sisters and daughters, or had female relatives with local ties. While the pacification of England takes almost two decades and sees a number of attempts by Edgar Ætheling to reclaim his throne, the wake of the Conquest is also defined by the creation of a distinctive Anglo-Norman or Cambro-Norman identity among the new ruling elite. A number of leading literary figures of the Twelfth Century in particular come to represent this new hybrid identity, which is in turn reflected in their work. A particularly prominent example is leading 12th Century historian and scholar, author of the Gesta regum Anglorum, William of Malmesbury, born c.1095 to an English mother and Norman father. Likewise, his rough contemporary Orderic Vitalis (b.1075), author of the Historia Ecclesiastica, was the son of a French priest and his English wife. Tutored by English monks, Orderic remarks that he never learned any French until late in his career when he found himself posted to France, and despite his parentage, felt out of place there. Leading 12th-13th Century Cambro-Norman historian, polemicist, and hater of all things Irish, Gerald de Barri was the nephew of Robert FitzStephen, a leader of the 12th Century invasion of Ireland. A powerful Marcher family, they were the son and grandson of Nest ferch Rhys, daughter of the last king of Deheubarth, Rhys ap Tewdwr. Gerald\\'s grandfather was Nest\\'s first husband, Gerald de Windsor, who was himself the son of Walter FitzOther (from the Tuscan Gherardinis) and probably the North Welsh princess Gladys ap Conwyn, daughter of Rywallon ap Conwym, but also possibly an English woman called Beatrice. Similarly, Osbern FitzRichard, a major landholder in post-Conquest Worcestershire, Warwickshire, Nottinghamshire, and Bedfordshire, was married to another Nest, the daughter of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, King of Wales, and Ealdgyth, daughter of Ealdorman Ælfgar of Mercia and widow of Harold Godwinson. Their daughter was in turn married to Bernard de Neufmarché, a leading figure of the Norman conquest of Wales. While Eadgar Ætheling never reclaimed the throne of England, his sister Margaret married Malcolm III of Scotland in 1070, and their daughter Matilda married Henry I of England, son of William the Conqueror, in 1100. Henry I was of course the father of Matilda, Empress of Germany and Queen of England, and grandfather of Henry II. Within a generation of the Conquest of 1066, therefore, the English throne had returned to the Cerdicing bloodline, even if it did not necessarily outwardly resemble it. The current queen, Elizabeth II, is descended from the Hannoverian line which came to England in 1714. That line is descended from Elizabeth Stuart, daughter of James I/VI, who married Frederick V of Hannover. From James VI, however, there is a direct line of succession via Robert de Brus all the way back to Margaret and Malcolm III, and therefore right the way back to the 9th Century Ecgberht of Wessex, grandfather of Alfred the Great. Of course, how \"Anglo-Saxon\" that makes her after so many generations is up for debate.',\n",
       " \"It is true that there is almost no consensus even among the researchers on the single cause-effect on the beginning of the Viking Age, but at least I also argue against the classic over-population hypothesis. As I discussed in Did the Nordic countries use to have a comparatively larger population back at the time of the vikings? If not how were they so often able to raid Britain? the estimated population of Viking Age Scandinavia was less than half of the maximum estimated population of pre-modern Scandinavia just before the Black Death. This estimation is mainly based on the estimation of how much arable land was utilized, roughly calculated by place name evidence of the provenance of individual farms. In short, there was still some land to spare, but some Scandinavians chose to went out of their homeland in Viking Age Scandinavia. As for the agricultural technology, there was no clear revolutionary rupture in Scandinavia between the Viking Age and the Middle Ages, so the Vikings could utilize these lands to cultivate if they would really wanted to do so. It is also worth noting that the climate of Viking Age Scandinavia that belonged to 'medieval warmer period' is generally regarded rather as favorable than that of the High Middle Ages, especially after the middle of the 13th century, in the beginning of the Little Ice Age. The maximum number of the peasant navy levy in medieval Norwegian law (336 ships for the whole Norway) that I alluded in the linked answer also suggests that the number of ships of the raiders mentioned in the account of the victims in the British Isles as well as in the Continent is also probably exaggerated, at least to some extent, as I and others explained before in How large would Viking raiding parties be? In fact, the identification of 'large-scale' barbarian migration as 'driven by the over-population' has been a long-aged literary cliche, dating back further to (Late) Antiquity (Wolfram 1994). A Christian chronicler, Dudo of St. Quentin, borrowed this cliche to glorify the 'exodus' of the ancestor of the Normans in Normandy, then this explanation became widely known as a possible cause of the Viking immigrants in general, especially in modern times. As a variant of this tradition, some scholars even now proposes that the gender imbalance among the Scandinavians (i.e. over-population of young, male), due to the practice of gendered infanticide (selective female infant killing), could be a contributing factor of the Viking Ages (Barrett 2008), but I suppose this alternative does not sound so convicting since the practice of infanticide did certainly not begin suddenly in the 7th or 8th century Scandinavia.

       " 'In the Soviet Union, the party remade the army. In China, the army remade the party, then the party declared independence. During its earliest years, the Chinese Communist Party had a structure and leadership that resembled that of other Communist parties around the world: led by intellectuals, following the Leninist line, under Soviet military and political advisorship. When Chiang Kai Shek made war upon the Communists in 1927, they resisted using Soviet military doctrine, with disastrous results. In 1935, the \"military clique\" of the party, led by Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Peng Dehuai, and Lin Biao ousted the old leadership and their Soviet advisors, then rewrote Chinese Communism in their image. Their main ideological vehicle was the writings of Chairman Mao, which were in practice drawn from the \"table talk\" of this small group of generals. Unsurprisingly, the overwhelming majority of Mao\\'s writings focus on military topics, and those that address economics do so only in brief, and by drawing on his experience running wartime \"base areas\". None of the leaders of the military faction were genuine Communists in the early 1920s. Zhu was a warlord, Peng was a senior officer in a warlord\\'s army, Lin Biao was personally instructed by Chiang Kai Shek, and Mao was an entrepreneur whose bookstore franchise had just opened its 14th location. Before joining the Communist Party, Mao had campaigned for Hunan\\'s secession from China. Nor were any of the leaders well acquainted with Marxist theory - they would only become so under intellectuals\\' tutelage in the 1930s. The primary focus of the new ruling clique was the survival of the party form a military perspective, and all their ideological thought attempted to adapt what they knew of Communist theory to the realities of conducting war against a numerically and materially superior enemy. The militarists\\' control of the \"Party Center\" remained uncontested until the end of the Chinese Civil War. After taking control of the country, however, they were presented with immense administrative challenges which could not be solved using Maoist scripture alone. Mobilizing the countryside to produce crude weapons was a much simpler business than governing hundreds of millions of people and handling all aspects of their lives. To respond to these complexities, New China was forced to copy some of the methods of Old China. The newly formed PRC\\'s administration started to mirror that of the late Qing\\'s almost immediately: there were almost the same number of counties, in almost the same places. The PRC restored the village headman system, Qing-era ethnic management principles, and the Qing-era waterwork construction method. A major conflict soon emerged between those who wanted to govern China based on precedent, and those who wanted to build a new country with the PLA as their model. The latter camp were behind the notorious Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution, but also presided over successes like the literacy program. In general, during Mao\\'s lifetime, the militarist camp was dominant, but their power began to wane due to infighting in the early 1970s, coming to an end after Mao\\'s death. The victor in the post-Mao struggle for control of the Party Center, Deng Xiaoping, reversed many of the gains the militarists had made in the past 30 years towards reshaping the government in their image, and rebuilt many traditional institutions. As a former general, he carried enough respect within the PLA to avoid a coup. His successor, Jiang Zemin, had no such credentials, and was forced to reach an understanding with the military to prevent them from becoming a threat to his rule. It is not known whether this understanding was negotiated with or imposed upon the PLA, nor the exact contents, but what is clear is that the army\\'s culture and its role in politics changed dramatically during Jiang\\'s reign. The army effectively lived within a \\'walled garden\\': the party showered the brass with luxuries and allowed them to take bribes, but they no longer interfered in politics. Jiang also stripped them of most of their companies. As a result of this process, the \"state within a state\" was born. While initially the PRC could be characterized as an \"army with a country\", the dynamic between civil and military officials shifted during the late 1970s and resolved decisively in the early 1990s. As for the characterization of the PLA in web novels - obviously it can\\'t be entirely correct, but the image of generals living in luxury and having some measure of protection from officials has been true since the early Jiang years.

       " 'I have an older answer that addresses this topic: We tend to imagine the fall of the Roman Empire in terms of sound and fury: barbarian hordes crashing through city gates, temples collapsing in showers of sparks, drawn swords and ribbons of blood. For most people, however, the collapse of the Empire was marked not by a sudden or sharp transition, but by the slow unraveling of familiar things. Our literary sources, such as they are, present the viewpoint and concerns of the elite. Saints\\' lives, despite their tantalizing glimpses of a wider and less mannered world, are only partial exceptions. Archaeological evidence helps, though the portrait it paints is pointilistic - an abandoned village here, hasty burials there, a decided shortage of fine pottery there, etc. This patchy evidence, however, suffices to confirm what we would expect: the fall of the Roman Empire was experienced very differently by various groups of Roman citizens. In part, of course, it depended on where you lived, and on the historical circumstances that led to your particular bit of the Empire falling out of imperial control. Southern Gaul, for example, had a much easier transition out of the Empire than northern Gaul did. To an even greater degree, however, the way you experienced and understood the end of the Empire depended on how you lived - on whether you were rich or poor, urban or rural. If you were a literate member of the urban elite, you had a clear idea of what it meant to be a Roman citizen. After traveling across the Empire, the fourth-century author and official Ausonius, a native of Bordeaux, ranked its cities in a poem (uncreatively) titled The Order of Famous Cities. At the top of the list, of course, was Rome \"first among cities, the home of the gods.\" Later in the poem, describing his native place, he tellingly comments \"I love Bordeaux, but I venerate Rome.\" For a man like Ausonius, acutely aware both of the legal benefits of Roman citizenship (as a member of the \"better sort,\" he was entitled to special protections under the law) and of the Roman literary and cultural heritage, the Roman Empire had clear and deep significance. But for the vast rural majority of the Empire\\'s population, being Roman had a very different quality. Despite elite jibes that peasants didn\\'t even know they were part of the Empire (the fourth-century philosopher-turned-bishop Synesius of Cyrene once joked that the peasants of Libya thought Agamemnon was the current Roman emperor), it can safely be assumed that even the most remote farmers knew something about the Empire in which they lived. The taxmen made sure of that, as (to a greater or lesser extent) did the priests of their local churches. The rural majority\\'s understanding of the Empire, however, was not founded on high politics or literary heritage, but a vague sense that, somewhere very far away, there was an emperor, who battled barbarians and heretics. The products of Empire (as described in the excellent surveys of the archaeological evidence provided by /u/Tiako had penetrated almost every corner of the provinces. Few peasants, however, would have had any sense of the vast trade networks that made this possible. The collapse of the Empire, in short, would be experienced and interpreted very differently by a member of the urban elite than it would by a farmer in the hinterland. Your question asks about the average Roman citizen - but as I hope to have shown, there was no such thing. So let\\'s take two examples - a Gallic noble, and a frontier monk - and see how they understood the disappearance of Roman rule. Sidonius Apollinaris, a native of Lyon, is probably the best-known member of the final generation of western Roman aristocrats. Having served as prefect of Rome under one of the last emperors, he returned to his native Gaul and became bishop of Clermont. As bishop, he attempted to keep his city in the Empire, and outside the rapidly-expanding barbarian kingdoms of the Goths and Burgundians. But in 475, the year before Odoacer dispensed with the last western emperor, Clermont (despite Sidonius\\' opposition) opened its gates to the Goths. In a letter to a friend, Sidonius complained bitterly: \"The state of our unhappy region is miserable indeed....Our enslavement was made the price of security for a third party; the enslavement, ah! the shame of it!...We.... who by old tradition claimed brotherhood with Latium the region around Rome and descent like the Romans from the sons of Troy...have been betrayed...Our ancestors will cease to glory in the name of Rome if they have no longer descendants to bear their memory.\" (Ep. 7.7) For this aristocrat, leaving the Empire was the end of a world. On, then, to the frontier monk, St. Severinus of Noricum. Severinus had established himself at Batavis, a frontier post devastated by frequent barbarian incursions. Probably in the same year that Sidonius watched the Goths enter Clermont, Severinus witnessed the end of Roman rule in Noricum: \"So long as the Roman dominion lasted, soldiers were maintained in many towns at the public expense to guard the boundary wall. When this custom ceased, the squadrons of soldiers and the boundary wall were blotted out together. The troop at Batavis, however, held out. Some soldiers of this troop had gone to Italy to fetch the final pay to their comrades, and no one knew that the barbarians had slain them on the way. One day, as Saint Severinus was reading in his cell, he suddenly closed the book and began to sigh greatly and to weep. He ordered the bystanders to run out with haste to the river, which he declared was in that hour besprinkled with human blood; and straightway word was brought that the bodies of the soldiers mentioned above had been brought to land by the current of the river.\" (Eugippius, Life of Severinus, 20) As remarkable as this dramatic incident, however, is the total lack of commentary on the disappearance of Roman rule. The saint wept for the dead soldiers; but the fact that Batavis was now outside the Empire was apparently just taken as a fact. Severinus and his flock had more pressing matters (famine, barbarian raids, etc.) to worry about. Most citizens of the Roman Empire probably only discovered that the Empire had vanished when a different set of taxmen appeared, or their priest mentioned distant disasters in his sermons, or barbarians suddenly appeared and evicted them from their land. For most Romans, life had always been hard. Now it simply became harder, and stranger.',\n",
       " \"First off, u/toldinstone(/user/toldinstone)'s answer is excellent. I will try to add to it. Would an “average” resident of the Empire (there was no such thing, but let’s just assume as a thought experiment) have perceived an ongoing decline? Probably not as such. On the one hand, the chnages that were happening were probably too gradual to be noticed in the course of daily existence; on the other hand, the events that were noticeable – catastrophes like major military defeats or occupations or barbarians setting up new kingdoms – may not have been felt as part of an ongoing process of “The Decline and Fall of Rome” (TM), so much as isolated events. Even such events that were locally catastrophic may not have attracted much notice in other provinces (for the breakdown of communication and a growth of parochialism were also concomitant of decline). But if we slightly rephrase your question and ask instead, Would someone have noticed a decline if we could magically transport them from the year 400 or so to 500, or even from 400 to 600, then the answer is almost certainly yes, and to our hypothetical “average” resident of the Empire it may indeed have seemed that a world-shattering catastrophe had taken place. The barbarians that had always been raiding across the Rhine and the Danube had overrun the border and set up their own kingdoms within the Empire, and effectively replaced the Roman government. Cities had shrunk or vanished entirely, because the wide-flung interdependent economic systems that supported them had been shattered, and there was no more any infrastructure to maintain dense populations. Communities across the Empire were smaller and poorer; buildings, including the churches that were often the center of community life, were also smaller and more rudely built. Literacy rates (never high in the ancient world, by modern standards) had declined precipitously. Running water and plumbing became rare. It's also fair to say that not all of the changes were perceived as bad; some Roman citizens seem to have thought that living as a Frank or a Goth was better than living as a Roman serf, especially in Gaul. A caveat: note that all of this, including the whole question of the “decline,” presupposes that we’re talking about the Empire in the West. The Empire in the East, which we normally call Byzantine for no particularly good reason, went on its merry way with relative continuity. There were changes, certainly, but nothing like what we see in the West. Yet another caveat: Many of these changes that we associate with “The Decline and Fall of Rome” (TM), such as a decrease of economic sophistication, growing parochialism, a decline of literacy, etc, were parts of trends that had started well before and continued long after, and were not at all the immediately result of Rome being sacked by the Goths (which in itself had relatively little effect). Italy in particular, strangely, seems have to entered a period of sharp economic decline quite early. Everything about this topic is enormously controversial. Traditionally, and still today popularly, people imagined a precipitous decline and fall where Roman civilization collapsed into barbarism (the East was and is generally ignored). Recently, historians have reacted against this perception, and emphasized continuity rather than change, and that any changes that did happen were gradual and not necessarily always for the worse. For a while, it was difficult for any respectable scholar even to suggest that there might have been a decline (and using the phrase “dark ages” is still heavily stigmatized). That seems to have balanced out a bit, and various historians have been expressing more nuanced views both of what changed and of what stayed the same, and emphasizing that different areas and different populations experienced both continuity and change very differently. Sources and recommended reading: Wickham, The Inheritance of Rome (a generally optimistic work, stressing continuity and contextualizing what change did occur); Ward-Perkins, The Fall of Rome (a generally pessimistic work, stressing change and decline). These are two great books that go great together, and I suspect that the authors would mostly agree with one another's points and differ mainly in what they emphasize. Also worth mentioning is Heather, Empires and Barbarians, though its focus is mostly a bit later.\",\n",
       " 'I can\\'t tell you much about the sea-faring ability of the Almoravids and other Islamic powers that held Morocco prior to the 15th century, though do I get the impression that they were pretty solidly land powers. What I can tell you is that the winds and currents off the Moroccan coast make visiting the Canaries rather more difficult than you might expect. The entrance to the Mediterranean is about at the latitude that the easterly equatorial winds meet the westerly upper latitude winds, such that they tend to form a variety of loops in the Atlantic. The Atlas mountains on the African coast direct the winds offshore to basically follow it southwest, and the currents do about the same. At about the Canaries, the winds start to catch more of the equatorial \"trade winds\", and head out into the Atlantic. These blow all the way to Brazil and the Caribbean... which is exactly what later Iberian sailors would do to get to the Americas. But getting on a fast track to Brazil isn\\'t what you want to do if you\\'re not really prepared for it. There is a decent way back to shore, though: if you manage to make your way more to the west, you can catch an eddy in the winds that goes out to sea and starts to loop back around, through the Azores and back to Iberia and the entrance to the Mediterranean. Take a look at to see what those winds are doing today. They\\'re fairly permanent, so it\\'s likely you\\'ll see what I describe above on any given day. This particular route the Portugese called (once the discovered it) the \"volta do mar\", or \"turn of the sea\". It ended up being a middle step to eventual Atlantic crossings, but that\\'s a different story. But while it works, it\\'s not something you want to do unless you\\'re prepared for some significant blue-water sailing. If you don\\'t know this technique, and/or are not prepared to do it, the Canaries are a bit of a trap; easy to get to, but hard to return from by sail. The other option, of course, is to just ignore the wind and row back. This is likely what the Romans did when they visited the Canaries. Galleys would still have been available in the medieval Mediterranean, and indeed were the principal warship of the time, but were a rather expensive proposition. (And they did rely mostly on wind for long-distance propulsion, making a return under oars a tiring, though possible, affair.) If the masters of the Moroccan coast indeed had such vessels (and probably they did; I just don\\'t know to what degree), they may have considered it a poor idea to conquer a few useless islands at such a high cost. It was, ironically, much cheaper for the Castillians, and later the Portugese, to visit with sailing ships, once the techniques for return were established, and it was a handy stop for them on the way to very profitable trade centers in sub-Saharan Africa.',\n",
       " 'No, they are not, but the answer requires some qualification. Ancient Greek myths are set sometime \"long, long ago\". The ancient poet Hesiod, in his Works and Days, came up with a system of different Ages (really: \"generations of men\"): the Golden Age, followed by the Silver Age, the Bronze Age, the Age of Heroes (or Heroic Age), and finally the Iron Age. The Iron Age was the time when Hesiod himself lived, so contemporary ancient Greece (in his case, around 700 BC). (The Roman poet Ovid would merge the Age of Heroes with the Bronze Age, reducing the number of ages to four.) In any event, the Age of Heroes had ended some time earlier -- the ancient Greeks used genealogies to fill in the blanks between their own age and the earlier period of the heroes. A later poem called the Ehoiai or Catalogue of Women, wrongly attributed to Hesiod, is a good example of a genealogical poem. It lists the ancestry of e.g. Perseus and Herakles. High-ranking Greeks of the historic era could often trace their families lineages along such semi-mythical lineages back into the distant past. Exact dates were murky, but that didn\\'t preclude some ancient commentators from calculating when e.g. the Trojan War had happened. The Age of Heroes is when all of the major events from Greek heroic saga are set: this is the time period during Perseus fought Medusa, Herakles performed his Labours, Theseus slew the Minotaur, there were two successive sieges of the Greek city of Thebes, and so on. The Age of Heroes ended shortly after the Trojan War. Modern scholars for a long time believed that Greek myths were just that -- stories. But then archaeological discoveries at the end of the nineteenth century revealed that the Aegean had been the home of earlier civilizations set in what archaeologists refer to as the \"Bronze Age\", including one that Heinrich Schliemann dubbed \"Mycenaean\". The response was -- eventually -- to equate the archaeological Bronze Age with the Heroic Age (or Ovidian Bronze Age) and all of a sudden we seemed to have had an actual setting for the stories of the ancient Greeks. As time went on, it became obvious that there were important differences between the archaeologically attested Bronze Age and what could be found in Greek myths, most notably the Homeric epics. Initial enthusiasm for equating the \"real\" Bronze Age with the mythical Age of Heroes ebbed away and made way for healthy scepticism. I know of few experts who would today defend the idea that the Aegean Bronze Age relates one-to-one with the world of the ancient Greek heroes. (It remains common in popular media, much to my chagrin; see also the AMA about the game A Total War Saga: Troy that /u/Iphikrates and yours truly took part in.) See also this thread in which some of my comments deal with the date at which point Homer\\'s epics were written down (among other things). This thread also contains many replies of mine that deal with Mycenaean Greece and the relationship between Homer and history. If you want a concise version, you can also read my article on the relationship between Homer and history on the Bad Ancient website. So is there no link at all between Mycenaean Greece and the later Greek myths? The latter are known to us only from the historic period onwards: again, Homer and Hesiod are usually believed to be the earliest poets whose works have survived, and they are dated to ca. 700 BC. There is also the so-called Nestor\\'s cup from Pithekoussai (near modern Naples) which refers to Nestor and it dates to the eighth century BC, indicating that at least some of the stories and/or characters familiar to us existed back then. By far the earliest mythological thing recognizable to us is a Centaur recovered from the site of Lefkandi and dated to ca. 950 BC, which may -- based on a wound to the knee -- may be identified as the Centaur Chiron, who, according to later Greek myth, taught a number of heroes, including Achilles and Jason. But nothing recognizable stretches back to the Bronze Age, though we do encounter familiar names of gods in the Mycenaean Linear B tablets (e.g. Zeus, as per my reply here At this point, I would recommend you check out John Boardman\\'s book The Archaeology of Nostalgia: How the Greek Re-Created Their Mythical Past . In this book, Boardman shows how the Greeks continuously (re)created their past using stuff that they could not otherwise explain. For example, Mycenaean remains -- such as the imposing walls around Mycenae itself, built in the thirteenth century BC -- were explained in mythological terms (as the work of Cyclopes directed by Perseus). In other words, the Greeks did encounter relics from a more remote time, but they had no clue what they actually were, and instead fitted them into an image of the past that they created according to their own needs. Of course, none of this has stopped some people from trying to \"historicize\" or \"rationalize\" ancient Greek myths (e.g. the Minoan palace at Knossos has a labyrinthine layout and therefore must be the inspiration for the story of Theseus and the Labyrinth), but that way madness lies. I hope this answers your question to your satisfaction: feel free to post follow-up questions, of course.',\n",
       " 'You will usually eat at home. If you are the master (i.e., the master craftsman, owner and manager of the business), you own the building. If you are an apprentice, or an employed journeyman, you not only work in the master\\'s workshop, you live in the master\\'s home. A common house plan was for the workshop to be on the ground floor, the master\\'s family\\'s living quarters on the floor above (the 1st floor, for those who count ground-1st-2nd), and the apprentices (and journeymen, if any) on the top floor above that (the 2nd floor). There might be a cellar for storage. Details beyond this would depend somewhat on the trade. One common pattern was for the front part of the ground floor (fronting the street) to be the workshop and the retail space, with a hall to the rear. This hall would be where lunch would be eaten, the master and his family, the apprentices, and the employees eating together. If there is a courtyard, and the weather is suitable, you might eat in the courtyard. If more separation is wanted between the workshop and the retail space, then there might be separate rooms for workshop and retail, with the retail space on the street frontage. Alternatively, a semi-permanent retail booth might be built in the street in front of the building (and such booths might be built in front of pure residences, or workshops that don\\'t require such a booth, to be rented to retailers). Some trades need more space, and were often segregated, clustered together in districts. Butchers, blacksmiths, tanners, and other trades generating lots of noise, smoke, or stench would typically be segregated. Butchers, for example, would often have large yards behind the house, used for keeping livestock prior to slaughter, and slaughtering and the first stages of butchering would take place in the yard. Butchers often had a retail booth in the street in front of the house. Thus, the standard lunch for a skilled craftsman was a substantial home-cooked lunch (typically the biggest meal of the day). Just lock the front door or booth, retire to the hall behind the workshop, and eat (and maybe nap), and then start work again in the afternoon. There were variation on this pattern. Workers who worked alone (and often lived alone) might rent a small workshop. This might have simple living quarters above, or living quarters could be rented nearby. Often without significant cooking facilities in either their small workshop or smaller living space, and without family to cook for them while they work in the morning, these craftsmen might choose to eat out, to buy their lunch. Traders selling from booths in the market might also buy their lunch, and unskilled labourers, too. Their other choice would be to lock up their market booth for lunch, and go home and eat. Their choice would depend on whether they lived alone, or with their family or employer. This pattern of lunch being the main meal, and being eaten at home, continued in many places in Europe well into the Industrial Age. Separate work and living places only became the normal situation with industrialisation, and it took time for dining habits to catch up with the new work and living habits. Intermediate between the ancient pattern of workers eating a main-meal lunch at home and the modern pattern of workers bringing a small-meal lunch with them, or buying lunch, was a substantial home-cooked lunch being delivered to the worker. In some places, a delivered home-cooked meal is still common, e.g., in Mumbai, where they are often delivered by professional tiffin-carriers: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mumbai_Dabbawala_or_Tiffin_Wallahs-_200,000_Tiffin_Boxes_Delivered_Per_Day.jpg References and further reading: Residential and workplace patterns: Langton, J. , \"Residential Patterns in Pre-Industrial Cities: Some Case Studies from Seventeenth-Century Britain\", Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers 65, 1-27. https://doi.org/10.2307/621607 https://www.jstor.org/stable/621607 Sjoberg, G. , \"The Preindustrial City\", American Journal of Sociology 60, 438-445. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2772531 Medieval house/workshop plans: W.

       " 'While you remember correctly that large numbers of Jews, or more accurately the Judahites (the people of the kingdom of Judah) were conquered and deported by Babylon, and that they were allowed to return by the Persians, there is one major misconception: The Jews were not enslaved by the Babylonians. The Babylonians had slavery, but it was never the sort of mass chattel slavery more familiar modern colonial history or the Roman Empire. The bulk of labor in the ancient Near East was performed by nominally free peasants. Instead, the Biblical history of the Babylonian Captivity is related to a process of mass deportation, but not enslavement. This was a system pioneered by the Assyrians in which a large swath of people from a particularly obstinate or rebellious city or small territory would be forcibly moved somewhere else, under the basic premise that they would be productive but not rebellious elsewhere in the Empire. In some concept, another deported population would then be sent to take their place, but it\\'s unclear how exactly this worked, and whether or not it ever happened to Judah is likewise up for debate. The Assyrian version of the same practice also appears in the Bible. When Assyria conquered the northern kingdom of Israel (as it is known in the Bible) or Samaria (as it is known in contemporary sources), they too deported a large swath of the Hebrew population. This is the origin of the so-called \"Ten Lost Tribes of Israel,\" referring to the ten Israelite tribes that the Bible describes inhabiting the northern kingdom. They are lost because neither the Bible nor the Assyrian records help us identify where they were resettled and they were never re-identified by later ancient Jews. The Achaemenids mostly seem to have abandoned this practice, though examples of it still appear to have occurred in the Persian period. For example, the population of Miletus, the Greek city which lead the Ionian Revolt, was deported to a town in southwestern Iran, and Greeks from Cyrenaica were sent to Bactria after the Achaemenid satrap of Egypt conquered Lybia. More importantly, Cyrus the Great intentionally portrayed himself as beneficent and divinely ordained during his conquest of Babylon. The city of Babylon itself also apparently faced minimal repercussions for its resistance, and the Cyrus Cylinder implies that the city fell peacefully, though other sources cast that claim into doubt. Depending on how you interpret the Cyrus Cylinder, it may be taken as evidence that Cyrus ended the exile of all peoples deported by the Babylonians and allowed them to go home as a way of fostering support among his new subjects. Sending people to their parents\\' and grandparents\\' homelands would also, ironically, have the same effect as the original deportations. Achaemenid attitudes toward slavery are also often misrepresented to imply that Cyrus was somehow an abolitionist. This is not true. The Persians both practiced and permitted slavery in their territory, which I discuss more in this thread',\n",

       " \"Rather than being allowed to marry Napoleon, Marie Louise was offered as a potential bride for Napoleon by the Emperor of Austria, Francis I (the former Holy Roman Emperor and nephew of Marie Antoinette). I usually argue for looking more at personal motivations and the reality of religious faith in history, but in this case it's all about the realpolitik outweighing moral concerns. When it comes to international royal marriages, most concerns about religion and the like could be waived. Napoleon was trying to build his own dynasty and his own familial network of power across Europe, using, at first, his own siblings, giving them royal titles and/or marrying them into royalty - but a second generation was needed to cement their status. He had considered divorcing Josephine a few times, because he needed children, which the couple were not producing, but - despite his and her infidelities - he loved her and didn't want to break from her. Still, in 1809 he told her that they were through, and she collapsed in tears and had to be carried to her room. While the pope would probably have not dissolved their marriage, what was left of the clergy in Paris granted him an annulment the next year. This is not a divorce, although historical annulments are often popularly thought of as divorces: an annulment means that the marriage retroactively never happened, and there is no barrier to remarrying and no cultural stigma attached to the couple. In their case, it was argued that the lack of witnesses to their wedding made it not legal. To show Napoleon's status as emperor and make him seem as much like a legitimate French monarch as possible, he needed (and wanted) the kind of wife that an ancien régime French king would have - a foreign princess from another great power. There were two main options: Marie Louise of Habsburg-Lorraine, daughter of Francis I; and Grand Duchess Anna Pavlovna, sister of the Tsar and granddaughter of Catherine the Great. Napoleon leaned more toward the Russian princess, who could have solidifed an alliance between the two countries, but their mother - who had the final say over her marriage - hated him; when the offer of marriage was sent, the empress dowager asked for some time to think about it and Tsar Alexander stalled, which the French took as a refusal. So Napoleon withdrew his offer and turned to the Austrian court instead, which had already been well prepared and promptly accepted. The Austrians had actually reached out to Napoleon in 1809 to make the offer first! From their perspective, their country was in a very weakened state in comparison to years past, and this marriage would make sure that France stayed on their side in the future. A queen/empress was also expected to act as an unofficial diplomat, and an Empress Marie Louise would have been able to advance Austrian interests even beyond the kind of cordial relations expected following such a marital alliance. (Marie Louise herself was not in favor of the match, as she had grown up hating and fearing Napoleon, and in 1810 was in love with another man of lower rank.) This did not work out, part of the parallels between the Marie Louise/Napoleon and Marie Antoinette/Louis marriages, and the separation from Russia would also prove to be disastrous in the long term, but it's easy to see how this would have been seen as beneficial in the moment.\",\n",
       " 'Greetings! In addition to u/EdHistory101\\'s excellent link to their previous insightful comment on the matter, I can try and point out some general tips and tricks to help get another fledgling historian (or at the very least a passionate student of history) started on their journey through the past. Who knows? Maybe that 12-year old will find themselves asking (or even responding to!) questions on AskHistorians sometime in the not-so-distant future. Let\\'s begin. Firstly, try at least initially to stay away from historiography. The one thing that I find kills any interest for history (even if its interest which has been studied and developed over months) is tossing someone headfirst into the deep end of scholarly publications. They\\'ll get to that realm in time, so I\\'d recommend ensuring that they have a good grasp of the facts as well as a general overview of the topic at hand. Then, and with some guidance, start introducing the \"bigger problems\" of that topic (i.e the idea of \"responsibility\" for war or \"what this person did for a group\"). In my experience teaching students of about 15-16 years of age, once they\\'ve gotten comfortable with re-framing information in light of a certain \"question\", they have a much better time understanding the arguments of historians and discussing it with other people (in this instance, OP perhaps). In summation: make sure the young\\'un understands the who, what, where, when, and (basic) why before getting into the how, whodunnit, and so what. Secondly, choose a good starting point. Building onto the comment of EdHistory101, \"anchoring\" the learning back to a person, place, or even personal connection is a great way to start off their learning. Does this person have a particular interest in a notable scientists, inventor, or state leader in history (the three most common \"history starter archetypes\" I\\'ve encountered)? Are they more familiar with the history of their own family with regards to where they came from? Attempting to teach them the massive influence of the Industrial Revolution on our way of life might be easier, you\\'ll find, if you can pick out the role of an inventor they appear to be specifically drawn to, or if you can relate it to a familial sub-topic (i.e how their ancestors migrated to seek work in the cities, or what kind of changes they might have seen in the workplace). Start with the specific, then zoom out to the big picture, but keep track of where that specific person, sub-topic, or ancestor was during this time. Thirdly and finally (at least from me), always include them into the process. You may know their interests well enough, but once the learning starts, that interest can disappear or fade at the turn of a page (or the scroll of a website, or the credits of a documentary). Keep asking them questions about how they found the information, and whether or not they understood it to the extent that they\\'re willing to continue looking into the topic. It\\'s alright if this person loses interest in an area or two. I recall myself being absolutely invested in studying Ancient Rome and Mesopotamia at the age of 12, but losing complete interest once I found out that the Industrial Revolution and the 19th century was far more to my tastes. Hope this trio of tips helps a bit, and let me know if you have any follow-up questions or pm me for particular sources/areas of entry!',\n",
       " 'The replacement of the state of Joseon (조선/朝鮮) by the Daehan Jeguk (대한제국/大韓帝國), undertaken by King Gojong (고종/高宗) in 1897 (who latterly became the Gwangmu (광무/光武) Emperor), was a moment of great symbolic significance at the time, but which has naturally been much overshadowed by the occupation of Korea by Japan in 1904 and its outright annexation six years later. Unfortunately, the question of how China and Japan responded is not a particularly complex one to answer in and of itself, so I will mostly be providing the earlier background, but I hope that provides useful context as to why the responses were as they were. To fully understand why the Joseon king saw fit to elevate his status in 1897, and the seeming lack of a significant response from China and Japan, we need to consider Korea’s foreign relations more broadly. For most of the Early Modern period, the principal polities operating in Korea’s vicinity were of course China and Japan, but by the latter half of the nineteenth century, Korea had also seen the arrival and intrusion of a number of European powers, most significantly Russia, but also Britain, France, the United States, and Germany. I have used ‘China’ and ‘Japan’ somewhat generically so far, but from here on out I will be more specific. The Qing should not be seen as a direct continuation of the Ming. Korea did not simply peaceably transfer allegiances when the Qing marched into Beijing in 1644. Rather, Korea was militarily forced into submission to the Qing regime following two wars in 1627 and 1636/7. A recognition, though increasingly muted, of Qing military superiority lay behind future relations. Moreover, the foreign, Manchu origin of the Qing monarchs and much of their ruling caste, the Banners, meant that the Koreans largely viewed the Qing as an illegitimate barbarian dynasty, and moved to consolidate their own status as the last bastion of Confucian civilisation following the fall of the Ming. As a recent book by Yuancong Wang has argued, this process of othering can also be applied in the other direction, as the Qing constructed Joseon as an ‘outer’, even ‘barbarian’ state, whose submission legitimised Qing authority. Yet at the same time, the ritual relationship between the Qing and Joseon states became significantly more formalised and entrenched, and was taken to far greater lengths than had been the case even between Joseon and the Ming. Elaboration of style compensated for general lack of substance when it came to the two states’ relations. In addition to the more abstract nature of Qing-Korean relations, there was also the very nitty-gritty matter of the Qing-Korean border. While the Yalu and Tumen Rivers, which flow out of Mount Baekdu (a.k.a. Shanghai Mountain, or Golmin Šanggiyan Alin in Manchu) were set as the natural boundary between the two states, these are fordable at many points, and being relatively remote and forested, the use of boats or rafts as a means of crossing was not difficult. This is significant not because of immigration, but rather because of the natural resources in the region, particularly furs, pearls, and especially the medicinal root ginseng, commodities which could be harvested on a small scale with limited effort by small groups or even individuals. Over the course of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, the Qing and Koreans had eventually come to an agreement to disallow settlement within a certain distance of the rivers, so as to prevent or at least limit the scale of cross-border harvesting and smuggling. Commerce and resources also played into Joseon’s relations with the changing regimes on Japan, which had of course been somewhat strained, to say the least, by the invasions of Korea orchestrated by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1592 and 1597. However, relations were normalised in 1609 when Joseon resumed commercial contact with the Sō clan, the rulers of Tshushima Island, who had been the primary intermediaries between Korea and Japan before the Toyotomi. It is important to note that it was primarily the Sō clan whom Joseon dealt with, not the Tokugawa Shogunate directly. This system of indirect relations, where both sides mainly made contact at a designated entrepôt, has obvious parallels with the Dutch port at Dejima or the Canton System used by the Qing to regulate trade with European powers. While older scholarship has argued that the watershed moment for Korea came with the Treaty of Ganghwa with Japan in 1876, a recent book by Seonmin Kim on the shifting Qing-Korean border offers an interesting alternate approach to relations between the two states, and one which suggests an earlier turning point. Namely, the collapse of the Manchurian ginseng industry, which culminated in the dissolution of the Qing monopoly on the root in 1853. The collapse of the monopoly was big news. At its height in 1760, the Qing issued permits for 36,000 taels of ginseng, worth nearly 1.5 million taels of silver. By 1852, fewer than 300 permits were issued, and the monopoly was abolished outright the next year. This had huge implications for Manchurian provincial revenues, which could not be compensated for from China because Chinese revenues were now being poured into the civil war against the Taiping. With no money to fund controls on internal migration, and the need to reestablish some kind of Manchurian economy, the Qing began to allow Han Chinese colonisation in the Yalu river valley, and establishing civilian administrators. In so doing, the space between Qing and Joseon transitioned from a deliberately emptied, loosely-managed borderland to a fixed border, as the Qing settled up to the limits of their own territory and imposed administrative controls (to a degree). The actual fixing of the border and the full establishment of Joseon institutions to deal with the new situation would not be fully underway until the 1880s, well after the intrusion of non-Qing powers in Korea, but it can certainly be said that the processes that led to a firmer delineation of Qing and Joseon sovereignty had already been underway by the 1850s, well before Korea’s encounter with maritime imperialism. While Joseon had had occasional encounters with foreign shipping before 1876, its rulers and officials generally preferred to avoid contact, referring would-be emissaries to their suzerain, the Qing, on the basis that they were a vassal state and not entitled to engage in their own diplomatic relations, up to at least 1871. This ought, however, to be read as a convenient excuse rather than a statement of fact: as we have seen, Joseon had its own relations with Japan via the Sō on Tsushima. Moreover, the Qing were rather bewildered by this turn of events and responded to foreign queries about Korea by replying that Korea’s affairs were largely its own. What led to the end of this system of deliberate avoidance of contact was the Meiji Restoration in Japan. In 1871, the old clan dominions were abolished, including that of the Sō on Tsushima, cutting the main link between Joseon and Japan. While Joseon may not have considered the reopening of relations a pressing need, the new Meiji state in Japan saw an opportunity to extend its authority, and in 1875 began a series of military provocations intended to force Joseon to the negotiating table, culminating in a shootout between a Japanese gunboat and the Korean garrison on Ganghwa Island on 20 September, followed by the dispatch of a Japanese flotilla to Busan. Under pressure from the Qing minister Li Hongzhang to accept a diplomatic solution, Joseon signed the Treaty of Ganghwa with Japan in 1876, opening three treaty ports to Japanese merchants and granting Japanese subjects similar privileges as Western ones were in China and Japan. Thanks to the Treaty of Ganghwa, Japan gained more or less exclusive privileges in Korea for the next six years, but circumstances changed as other powers sought similar inroads. The Qing served as the primary facilitator, partly to further its own ends directly, but also in part to counterbalance Japan. Beginning in 1882, Li Hongzhang served as a proxy to negotiate treaties on behalf of Joseon with the United States, Britain, and Germany, while Joseon’s own negotiators went on to sign treaties with Russia, Italy, France, and Austria-Hungary. However, the Qing sought to enrich themselves specifically, and sought the greatest concessions. Citing its suzerainty over Korea, the Qing demanded greater privileges than afforded any other power, as well as greater honours for its own officials (namely the right to be brought to court in Korea in a sedan chair). While the first treaty, with the United States, took place earlier in the year, Qing influence would further increase in the wake of a failed coup against King Gojong that was suppressed by Qing troops, who would be stationed in Korea for the next three years and cement the influence of the Manchu government over the Joseon state. However, Japan did not take kindly to growing Qing influence, nor, necessarily, did King Gojong. In 1885, the Tianjin Convention between the Qing and Japan led to the withdrawal of Qing troops and an agreement not to dispatch troops to Korea except bilaterally, but the Qing then posted Yuan Shikai as their permanent official in Korea, which arguably increased the degree of theoretical Qing influence by creating a permanent civilian post rather than a nominally temporary military garrison force. Yet with the Qing army gone, Gojong thought he could seek an alternative source of support, and made two attempts to conclude a secret alliance with Russia, first in 1885 and then in 1886, but both attempts were foiled due to being leaked. The maritime foreign powers, principally Britain and the United States, opted to recognise the legitimacy of Qing suzerainty, leaving Korea short on options other than to continue to operate under Qing dominance for the foreseeable future.',\n",
       " 'The US-based Church of Scientology was actively involved in supporting apartheid in South Africa during the mid-20th century. The Johannesburg mission was founded in 1954 by a white South African couple after their extended trip with founder L. Ron Hubbard in England. Hubbard had many connections to white South Africans from the early days of his Dianetics project, a pseudoscientific self-help programme which would later evolve into the Church of Scientology. John McMaster, a white South African from Durban, was one of the first people to be declared \"Clear\" after being personally audited by Hubbard. (Auditing is Scientology\\'s version of psychotherapy, and being declared \"clear\" is a major milestone in spiritual development for a Scientologist.) Hubbard had long harboured racist ideals, and these made their way into Scientology. Dianetics, the landmark book Hubbard published in 1950, included Hubbard\\'s opinion that \"the Zulu is only outside the bars of a madhouse because there are no madhouses provided by his tribe\". In the 1956 Fundamentals of Thought, another foundational text for Scientologists, Hubbard wrote, \"the African tribesman, with his complete contempt for truth and his emphasis on brutality and savagery for others but not himself, is a no-civilisation\". His South African Scientologist followers such as John McMaster shared these views, and Scientology spread quickly throughout South Africa and Rhodesia in the 1960s. McMaster told his fellow Scientologists that Black Africans were too stupid to have their thoughts register on the E-Meter, Scientology\\'s tool for measuring mental turbulence. The day of the Sharpeville massacre, when 69 Black South African protesters were murdered, Hubbard sent a dispatch to South African Scientologists. It specifically instructed Scientologists on how to interrogate protestors to weed out \"subversives\", with questions like, \"Were you persuaded to make trouble, and was the person who persuaded you a native?\" The instructions implied that it might be necessary to use force on the subjects, suggesting that Hubbard may have intended them to be used by the South African police as well. Scientologists from the Johannesburg org attempted to demonstrate to the South African police how to use E-meters to interrogate protestors, though it\\'s unclear whether the police ever made use of these techniques. Hubbard appears to have been convinced that the protests were engineered by Soviet spies, so part of his support of strict measures against anti-apartheid protestors was inspired by a paranoid fear of communism, which was a dominant theme of his life and ideology. Within the United States, Hubbard included support of apartheid in his popular public lectures following the massacre. In one lecture given in Washington D.C., titled \"A Talk on South Africa\", Hubbard expressed clear anti-Black sentiments. Here are some excerpts (you can listen to the entire lecture here I’m not against the black man. As a matter of fact, I’m probably more friendly towards the black man than any person in this audience. ... Right now you tell me, well, the government of South Africa does not permit the black man a vote. He doesn’t even know what a vote is! ... Blacks kill off the Blacks. And all you’ve got to do is pull a stable government off the top of them and they promptly start killing each other off. ... You can’t understand anything about the Bantu by understanding anything about the American black man. The American black man in the first place has been mixed with Indian and white blood over a period of a couple of centuries or less, but has actually been in close proximity to the white man and white land civilization for a century or two, you see. ... I’d say they’ve got about 50 years to go before they get the South African Bantu up to the same status and level of civilization of the American Black. ... The Bantu doesn’t register the same on an E-meter as a White, and I have had to start a whole program of research in addition to everything else I’ve been doing, trying to find out how to read a Bantu on an E-meter. Because he doesn’t operate like an American Negro or like a European. ... I’m not actually trying to sell you the South African government. I could easily do so because I consider these men very able from what I have seen. They’re nice guys. I know them personally. Hubbard came to South Africa himself in 1960 and stayed there for several months. Scientology still operates the house he purchased there as a tourist attraction He pursued a personal relationship with the pro-apartheid South African Prime Minister Henrik Verwoerd. In particular, he promised Verwoerd that he would try to influence UK newspapers to be more favourable to the apartheid regime, since Scientology at the time also had a very strong presence in England. In a letter to Verwoerd, he also praised the government\\'s forced relocation of Black South Africans, which had caused international outrage and led to the severing of diplomatic ties with the UK: Having viewed slum clearance projects in most major cities of the world may I state that you have conceived and created in the Johannesburg townships what is probably the most impressive and adequate resettlement activity in existence. Any criticism of it could only be engaged upon by scoundrels or madmen and I know now your enemies to be both. While Verwoerd\\'s interest in Hubbard\\'s repeated offers of assistance appears to have been limited, the South African government did initially take a dismissive attitude towards growing resistance against Scientology from the Psychological Society of South Africa. Scientology demonizes psychiatrists and psychologists as the great enemies of humanity and have a long track record of characterizing mental health treatment as a deadly conspiracy, so the resistance to Scientologists was based more on this than on Scientology\\'s pro-apartheid stance. Nevertheless, the government appears to have been resistant to crack down on Scientology\\'s recruitment in schools due to Scientology\\'s open support of its apartheid policy - though eventually, as press for Scientology worsened in Africa throughout the 1960s, the government\\'s attitude towards Scientology cooled. Meanwhile, Hubbard travelled to Rhodesia to attempt to support the minority-white government\\'s rule and to expand Scientology there. (1/2)',\n",
       " 'This is a good question, and I think the first one is to sort out what we are talking about when we say \"Buddhism\". The territory of Shapur\\'s empire stretched to the Indus river, and included the territory annexed from the Kushan kingdom. Now, the Kushans seem to have practiced a syncretic form of Buddhism that mixed influences from Hellenic, Iranian, Indian and even Mesopotamian religion. Buddhism, which has a long tradition of syncretism, as practiced generally differs a lot from the more philosophical \"textbook Buddhism\" most people are familiar with. Mani is said to have spent time with learned men (I believe the term used is \"Brahmins\") in the far East of the Empire, and so he certainly had access to Buddhist thought one way or another. When it comes to what Manichaeism seems to have borrowed from it, what is usually pointed to are confluences with Gnostic Christianity: the flesh is corrupt, worldly pleasure is to be eschewed in favour of asceticism, and from this there is a general misogynistic streak portraying women as wicked temptresses. These can also be viewed as points of contrast with Zoroastrianism - there, the flesh is _corruptible_ but not inherently corrupt, pleasure is viewed as a good, and while there is misogyny it is not as deeply rooted and more of a patronizing and paternalistic kind, viewing women as weak and susceptible to corruption, rather than as corrupters of men. Where Manichaeism does borrow clearly from Zoroastrianism, this is more in cosmology and also not always easy to divide from the \"Gnostic\" influences - good and evil as polar opposites, a world divided into three stages (beginning, middle, end), etc. It\\'s not really widely agreed upon how much Mani was really drawing in Zoroastrian ideas, versus casting his notions in Zoroastrian terms, because a lot of his usage of Zoroastrian terminology seems pretty superficial. He uses \"Az\", or \"the Serpent\", as the name for the primal temptress, and Gehmurd (Zoroastrian Gayomard/Gava Meretan) as the name of the first husband, and these do not really match up with their usage in Zoroastrianism for the world-destroying serpent of the apocalypse Azdahag, and the primal, perfect man (the first husband is an entirely different figure in Zoroastrian cosmogony). So, I think the overall takeaway is that while Mani was obviously influenced by his patronage from a Persian king, he seems to have mainly drawn on influences to the extent where they helped shore up ideas he was already familiar with from early Christian sects. Although, influences back and forth between early Christianity, Hellenic mysticism, and Persian religion is pretty muddled and confusing, so it\\'s not always really possible to sort out what comes from where.',\n",
       " 'Max Hastings is a well-respected writer of military history. Inferno: The World At War, 1939–1945 and Retribution: The Battle for Japan, 1944–45 are listed on this sub\\'s Booklist under World War II and Catastrophe: Europe Goes to War 1914 under World War 1. Vietnam: An Epic Tragedy is a lengthy one volume that digs into a war that is difficult to contain in one volume. His ultimate prerogative in this book is to emphasize that the tragedy of the Vietnam War was based on the fact that no side or combatant deserved to win. He\\'s critical of both North Vietnam and the United States. For some reviewers of his book, he wasn\\'t critical of the US enough, however Hastings takes the position that all sides were bad and wrong on their policy in regard to Vietnam. But Hastings is careful to not completely blame the United States. For him, North Vietnam was an aggressor and a brutal regime that acted strategically and with coordination. North Vietnam wasn\\'t just villagers trying to stop imperialists, but were competent Communist foes aiming to assert itself over the rest of the country. Through this, he contextualizes the rationale of the United States involvement. He argues that the United States was deliberate if imperfect and brutal in their own measure. The United States acted with some diplomatic and, in some cases, military support from other countries who agreed with the US\\'s strategic position (the Domino Theory and Containment) at least in principle. He argues that the United States\\'s decisions weren\\'t as unilateral as it seems in retrospect, or as blundered in military actions. These ideas are controversial. A particular group with criticism of the book are Vietnam veterans themselves. Hastings writes in a language that sometimes chastises veterans and, most controversially among this group, dismisses the effects of Agent Orange. This review by The VVA Online shares this positon Hastings cites one study that Agent Orange and defoliants weren\\'t as severe. \"The defoliant was indisputably a loathsome instrument; yet that does not make it necessary to accept the more extreme claims about is effects on human beings exposed to it.” The VA has conceded that if someone has a related illness or negative health effect associated with Agent Orange and served in Vietnam during this time they can receive specific benefits. Hastings suggests that veteran exposure didn\\'t necessarily cause some of these health effects. A veteran who has diabetes, for instance, probably got this from their diet and not Agent Orange exposure - to paraphrase an example of Hastings\\'s in the book. The reason veterans receive these benefits is because the VA assumes that if you were around Vietnam, you were likely exposed Additionally, a 1994 NAS report Veterans and Agent Orange stated \"The committee found sufficient evidence of an association with herbicides and/or TCDD for three cancers: soft tissue sarcoma, non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma, and Hodgkin\\'s disease.\" None of this is to say that Hastings\\'s book isn\\'t a worthwhile read.

       " 'There are a lot of factors at play here. Your mine in 50 CE may be a small undertaking by you and a few friends, individual entrepreneurs. Or it may be a larger affair, with slaves possibly providing or augmenting the labor, and the experiences of the workforce even at that time could vary depending on the circumstance. For the mines in nineteenth-century Britain, change was afoot, and every decade brought innovations and differences in the approach. Because not every mine integrated change in different ways and at different times, we almost need to ask your time traveler about which mine he is approaching to seeks employment. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, your Roman-era miner might encounter a locally owned and operated excavation with friends and family providing the labor. By 1850, the mine was more likely run by a larger business concern and the miners were facing increasingly harsh conditions. Their mine would likely have been far deeper than was experienced in the Roman period and the workforce would likely be larger. Depending on the depth and prosperity of the mine, miners would have either descended by ladder or a hoisted rope (much like the Romans) or by a steam-operated hoist - which the Roman miner would have found shocking. The steam engine would likely be pumping water out of the depth - which would also be a curiosity for your Roman-era worker. In both cases, wooden supports would have been minimized because the wood costs money. Traditional mining in both period tried to rely on natural, native rock for mine supports, leaving \"eyes\" in the mine (natural pillars of rock left untouched). Safety costs but so does a collapsed mine, so there was always an attempt to balance need and cost, and danger was ubiquitous. In the Midlands (but not everywhere in Britain), your miner might encounter woman and children working underground. That would probably be a surprise for the Roman-era miner. Women were traditionally regarded as bad luck in a mine, but industrialization was forcing the abandonment of that folk belief.',\n",
       " 'Greetings! Welcome to AskHistorians, and I do believe that you have asked a proper question as per the guidelines of this sub (those can be reviewed here so you are up-to-speed on them). This is a most interesting question and it does speak volumes about why the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations do not appear to be in mainstream, public, historical narratives of 1939. But in truth, in historical academia the failure of this proposed pact has been written about and analysed many times over, as it is definitely important to the overall narrative of the Second World War to understand why the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was successful and this Anglo-French-Soviet pact was not. As a side-note, you might find this thread I weighed in on about why the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact worked useful as another source for this question. Let\\'s begin. Setting the Scene In August 1939, the Moscow Mission by Britain and France failed spectacularly; with negotiations on a proposed Anglo-Franco-Soviet Alliance getting nowhere. The problems were apparent from the outset. Here\\'s historian Michael Jabara Carley on the matter: \"The talks seemed of so little import that Halifax British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had \\'scarcely perused\\' British instructions. Concerns about Soviet impatience if the British dragged out the talks were shrugged off. And the British delegation was instructed to avoid discussion of Soviet aid to Poland and Romania; the Soviet Union would have to negotiate directly with the Polish and Romanian governments\". The key problem was that France and Britain were both unwilling to accept Moscow\\'s demands for an \"ironclad military alliance\". Stalin wanted a conditional collective security agreement, in which the Anglo-French government could support the Soviet Union in the eventuality of German invasion (a most astute prediction). After the failures of these talks with the Western Allies, it appeared as though Stalin\\'s best option (ironically) lay in making a deal with Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany. In addition to the greater likelihood that Hitler\\'s diplomats would actually take negotiations seriously, the Soviet leader believed that neutralising the German threat directly would not only secure his country\\'s precarious military isolation, but also give the Red Army precious time to recover after the disastrous \"Great Purges\" which had decimated its senior command. The rest as you likely know, is history. That at least, is the basic overview of events and motives surrounding the \"Western Betrayal\" of the Soviets in 1939 (if we can even term it that). Dissecting the Question So, on to the deeper question at hand: why had Chamberlain (Prime Minister and architect of appeasement) and Churchill (who was by 1939 First Lord of the Admiralty) failed to press onwards with this Anglo-French-Soviet Pact? The answer is far more complex than a single response could ever hope to flesh out, but I will attempt to give an overview of the main points here. Firstly, there was the ideological fear. The British government, ever since the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, had feared the Communist giant which had overthrown their Tsarist ally in the First World War. To many, Churchill and Chamberlain among them, the Bolsheviks were the equivalent of the devil, and Hitler\\'s regime was no worse (and even at times perceived as better) than Stalin\\'s one. Even Chamberlain\\'s ministers and advisers were hostile towards the Soviets, despite the interesting fact that much of their citizens actually preferred allying with the Soviets against Germany than attempting to appease them once more (though this opinion may have been more to do with pre-empting a disastrous war than actual support for the USSR). Jabara Carley on this conundrum: \"Halifax, a young anti-bolshevik \\'die-hard\\' in the early 1920s, was said to regard the USSR as \\'the anti-Christ\\'. Strang, head of the Central department, thought that Chamberlain opposed a Soviet alliance because it would signal the end of appeasement; he said \\'all at No. 10 are anti-Soviet\\'. Halifax explained to the French that \\'half the British population\\' held the Soviet Union responsible as much as the Nazis for \\'all the troubles of the last 10 years\\' The French were also weary of the Communists in Moscow, though they had by 1939 grown accustomed to dealing with left-wing parties in their own assemblies (and Prime Minister Edourad Daladier had silenced that internal threat by August 1939). In fact, the French seemed to be more concerned with ensuring that if an alliance could not be agreed upon, then it was the Soviets who should receive the blame for the failure, rather than the Western democracies. However, the French also (and perhaps mistakenly) decided to \"go with Britain\" on many of the points when negotiating the Soviets. They entrusted the Foreign Office to do much of the correspondence between the Allies and Moscow, whilst giving their support if certain conditions which the French believed ideal (such as not having to commit to a military alliance just yet), and generally waiting for the British to act on their behalf. This stagnation and delaying was most upsetting to Stalin and Molotov, who were also trying to see whether the Germans or the Anglo-French were the better party to be doing business with. Secondly, there was the condition of military intervention. The British and French were reluctant to commit their militaries in support of the Soviets, as that would clearly upset the Anti-Bolsheviks which occupied both governments, not too mention drag down public support for what would inevitably be a coming war. This point is actually interesting in itself, as Chamberlain also remarked that if it came to war with Germany, it would be the Soviets who could do the brunt of the fighting, as the British army consisted of only four divisions which could be spared for a European Expeditionary Force (he famously described this as \"two now then two later\".) The French also understood this benefit of an alliance, but their country had just suffered (and was still recovering) from the all-too traumatic and evident memory of the War to End All Wars. In order to address this problem, Chamberlain and his cabinet decided that Anglo-French military would only come if: \"Indirect aggression\" threatened either of the three powers, and the definition of that term was so ambiguous that the Foreign Office told Reginald Drax (the head of the Moscow Mission in August 1939) that negotiations should deliberately be slowed down to ensure Soviet acceptance of the British definition. The League of Nations had failed in intervening in German aggression (an eventuality which was practically guaranteed, since Germany had already left the League and therefore was not entitled at all to abide by its word). These conditions would take more time than was ideal to negotiate and agree upon, which to Chamberlain and his cabinet was perfectly fine, as they (wrongly) believed that the longer the Soviets were kept busy negotiating with them, they would not dare begin negotiations with Germany, and Hitler would not begin his expansion drive again for fear of adding more weight to an Anglo-French-Soviet alliance. Thirdly, we have the question of Romania and Poland. The Soviets wanted the British and French to negotiate with the Polish and Romanian governments as well, on the condition that Red Army troops be allowed to pass through their territory in order to combat the German threat. Neither the Romanians nor the Poles wanted this (after all, that same Red Army had invaded Poland in 1920, and the Romanians were also not particularly fond of their Communist neighbours). There was also the question of the Baltic nations, whose compliance Stalin and Molotov also wanted to secure, lest they become allies (willing or otherwise) of the Germans instead (and frankly, Poland and Romania were already difficult enough for the Anglo-French diplomats to collaborate with, the Baltic nations were a nightmare). As Jabara notes (perhaps somewhat logically though with a touch of exaggeration): \"They preferred would a year of Nazi occupation to a day of Soviet - which was what worried the Soviet government.\"',\n",
       " 'The central and northern parts of the Iberian Peninsula took the Romans centuries to conquer. Once the entire peninsula had been subdued, however, Lusitania - the province that includes the modern nation of Portugal - was neither notably rebellious nor especially ungovernable. I was unable to locate the source of your quote. I saw it attributed to the Republican general Galba (notorious for his slaughter of unarmed Lusitanians in the second century BCE) and to Caesar (notorious for being Caesar). But I never saw a specific source quoted, and failed to find it in what I assumed to be the logical places. According to this article (see pp. 391-2), the quote\\'s roots are medieval, not ancient. Although the phrase seems to be a later invention, it has some historical basis. After taking the southern coast of the Iberian Peninsula from the Carthaginians, the Romans worked for nearly two centuries to conquer the rest. Most of the Iberian Peninsula was characterized by networks of small settlements and a basically pastoral economy. The Romans could destroy a Hellenistic kingdom by taking its capital and/or destroying the king\\'s army. But in Iberia, they had fight a seemingly endless series of small actions, and victory meant only the acquisition of a chiefdom. The Romans were also repeatedly distracted from their conquests - above all by wars in the East - and tended to send armies and plan campaigns on a scale calculated to win a triumph for the governor, not permanent annexation. The political origins of the modern nation of Portugal are, of course, medieval. The region - and later province - that the Romans called Lusitania was neither culturally unified nor politically distinct. But the Romans did associate Lusitania with Viriathus the most formidable Iberian general they ever faced. The region was also closely linked with the rogue general Sertorius Lusitania, finally, was less thickly settled than regions farther south and east, and may have seemed correspondingly more \"barbaric\" to Roman eyes. In the imperial era, as mentioned earlier, the province of Lusitania was not particularly given to rebellion. The rebellious part of Spain in the imperial era was the far north, where the only Spanish legions were stationed. Lusitania was, if anything, quietly prosperous. Though never a notably wealthy province, it was fully integrated into the imperial economy. Emerita Augusta (now Merida, Spain), was an impressive place; the modern city, in fact, still features the longest extant Roman bridge As far as I can tell, in short, Portugal\\'s reputation for being ungovernable owes more to modern nationalism than ancient intractability.',\n",
       " 'I have read many times that the early medieval spatha was made of poor quality iron that couldn’t keep an edge European swords from the late Roman period through to the end of the early Medieval period vary a lot in the iron/steel they\\'re made from and their hardness. Some swords are all-iron (i.e., carbon content is below 0.3%, so the blade can\\'t be hardened by quenching). Most are steel-iron composites, often decoratively pattern-welded, often with hardenable steel edges; some, but not all of these hardenable swords have been quench hardened. The smallest group are all-steel, and against some quench-hardened and sometimes not. Carbon contents of the edges of the hardenable swords are usually from about 0.4% to about 0.6%. Hardnesses vary from about 180VPH (unhardenable iron) to about 700VPH (about 60HRC); about 300-350VPH (30-36HRC) is common. The hardest of these blades are harder than many (or even most) swords made today, or in the last few centuries, and would have excellent edge retention. The average sword was much softer, and would be considered sub-standard in modern times (where sword hardnesses of about 45-55HRC are usual, with some up to about 60HRC). The softest ones would have relatively poor edge retention - they would not stay sharp for long in use. However, not staying sharp for long when in use is a quite different thing from not being able to be sharp. A wrought iron or mild steel blade, low carbon and not hardenable by quenching, can be sharpened to a fine edge, and will cut. It will quickly become blunt, but not many cuts need to be made by a sword before an opponent is killed or at least badly wounded. For an example of an unhardened mild steel blade in action, see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVSopH2RU1s Such a blade can stay sharp enough for long enough to be useful. that it was more for bludgeoning than for cutting. There is no need of going to the expense of a sword for bludgeoning - it is simpler and cheaper to use a mace or a club. Swords were generally sharp (with the exception of purely thrusting swords, and modern military issue swords which were often only sharpened when at war (so that training would be safer, and in some cases so that the blunt swords could be used as less-than-lethal weapons for crown control)). it is rare for early iron/steel swords to be found in good enough condition for the sharpness of the edge to be judged, but when they are, they appear to have been quite sharp. Where the effect of swords is described in literature, they appear to be sharp. For example, when Beowulf fights Grendel\\'s mother, he is surprised when his sword, Hrunting, fails to cut her: For mighty stroke he swung his blade, and the blow withheld not. Then sang on her head that seemly blade its war-song wild. But the warrior found the light-of-battle was loath to bite, to harm the heart: its hard edge failed the noble at need, yet had known of old strife hand to hand, and had helmets cloven, doomed men\\'s fighting-gear. First time, this, for the gleaming blade that its glory fell. No failure of the sword, per se, but Grendel\\'s mother\\'s mighty magic! He then picks up an ancient sword (possibly even an old Celtic or Roman period sword, and therefore less likely to have a hardened edge), and uses it: \\'Mid the battle-gear saw he a blade triumphant, old-sword of Eotens, with edge of proof, warriors\\' heirloom, weapon unmatched, -- save only \\'twas more than other men to bandy-of-battle could bear at all -- as the giants had wrought it, ready and keen. Seized then its chain-hilt the Scyldings\\' chieftain, bold and battle-grim, brandished the sword, reckless of life, and so wrathfully smote that it gripped her neck and grasped her hard, her bone-rings breaking: the blade pierced through that fated-one\\'s flesh: to floor she sank. Bloody the blade: he was blithe of his deed. A later tale, Kormac\\'s Saga, describes Cormac\\'s unlucky loss in a duel to first blood: Bersi struck the first blow, and cleft Cormac\\'s shield; Cormac struck at Bersi to the like peril. Each of them cut up and spoilt three shields of the other\\'s. Then it was Cormac\\'s turn. He struck at Bersi, who parried with Whitting. Skofnung cut the point off Whitting in front of the ridge. The sword-point flew upon Cormac\\'s hand, and he was wounded in the thumb. The joint was cleft, and blood dropped upon the hide. Cormac breaks the tip off his opponent\\'s sword (damaging his own borrowed sword in the process), and the sword-tip hits and cuts his thumb. After having been used to destroy three shields, Bersi\\'s sword-point was still sharp enough to wound through incidental contact with little force behind it. There are two additional reasons to think that these swords were, typically, sharp. First, clothes were commonly worn in Europe. To wound the person wearing the clothes, it is important that one\\'s sword can cut through cloth. This needs a sharp sword. Second, swords from the Roman period and early Medieval swords often have snug hilts with guard and pommel that will sit close against the top and bottom of the hand. Hilts like these encourage the sword to be held at close to right angles with the forearm (in what is often called \"hammer grip\", with a straight or almost straight wrist). This grip works well for fighting with a shield, allowing effective slicing draw cuts. Draw cuts are often praised as the most effective sword cuts (e.g., by 19th century European writers on military swordsmanship British, and writers comparing British swordsmanship with Indian swordsmanship (and we can note that the talwar (or tulwar), a common Indian sword, has a similar draw-cut-friendly snug and supportive hilt)). However, they are poor for bludgeoning, since the slicing movement reduces the bludgeoning effect. These swords work well with draw-cuts, and therefore probably had sharp edges.

Railworks were at the time the main way for armies to mobilize, and it can't be overstated just how nervous every major power was about mobilization: the speed that their armies could do it, the ability to support it through logistics, etc. The Troisvierges line especially runs from the Rhineland, into France, and was considered a major artery that could be used to move men and supplies through that particular part of the front. Luxembourg being a tiny independent, ostensibly neutral duchy only had an army of around 400 serving men at arms, so they had no realistic way of keeping German military occupation from becoming a reality for them. I prefaced my answer with all of this because I too, sadly, couldn't find any concrete answer to your question specifically (how the train arrived, was it German or was it apart of a general Luxembourg surrender, etc). However what I could find all points to this being a German operation to seize that specific line (although their date is July 31st) in preparation for the invasion, to which Luxembourg responded by officially accepting military occupation by at most August 2nd (the exact day for this is also not exact across sources). So in short, all signs seem to point to the fact that it was a German train, probably a normal one (either due to no expected resistance, or to make it less obvious) and Germany would have no problem using their own trains on the tracks throughout France and Luxembourg as they were all adopters of Standard Gauge tracks, which is how that line from the Rhineland into France could be made in the first place. Hope that sort of helps!\",\n",
       " 'To make mud bricks, use soil or subsoil with 15-30% clay, and 50% or more sand, and add chopped straw or chaff. The traditional Egyptian practice was to mix Nile mud and desert sand to get the ideal consistency. Mix with water, and put the mix into your forms/molds, and leave it to dry. Usual Egyptian practice is to dry them for 3 days, and then turn them over, and dry them for another 3. The bricks can be used then, but it\\'s better to dry them for longer - to dry longer, they\\'re turned onto their side, for better airflow when drying. Done! Too little clay, and the brick will be crumbly. Too much sand, and the brick will be crumbly. Too much clay, and the brick will shrink to much when drying and probably crack. If the amount of clay is fairly high, the straw can be left out - this will produce weaker bricks, but without any potential problems if insects eat the straw in the brick. The straw adds strength, makes the bricks lighter (so higher walls can be built), and helps the bricks dry faster. There are some optional ingredients. Crushed broken pottery can be added. Dung can be added; dung can be used in addition to straw, or can be used as a substitute for straw. If you are a herder rather than a farmer, you are likely to have more dung available than straw, and you will use dung. Seeds are found in some old mud bricks - these might have found their way into the bricks via dung rather than being deliberately added. The excrement referred to in The Satire of Trades is probably this dung. You don\\'t want to use just any dung! You want dung with a high content of plant fibres - cow dung is ideal. Other dung would work well too, like horse and elephant dung. Dung in small hard pellets, like goat dung, will be harder to use, but will work. Dung has at least one advantage over straw: it doesn\\'t need to be chopped, since the plant fibres have been chewed. There is one other possible advantage of using dung: the mud brick mixture (mud, sand, straw/dung, water) is kneaded and is then ideally left overnight, or for a couple of nights, to ferment. This fermentation produces lactic acid, which results in a stronger brick. Lactobacillus bacteria which are responsible for this fermentation are found (in large numbers) in cow dung (and other dung), and the addition of dung is likely to result in faster and more uniform fermentation of the mixture. While squeamish modern urban folks might think that this sounds very yucky, cow dung isn\\'t nasty stuff. The smell is minimal (although cattle feedlots with huge amounts of dung can easily be pretty stinky). Some country folks (mostly children) delight in the feeling of standing in fresh cow pats and having the warm dung ooze between their toes. In many parts of the world, cow dung is used to plaster internal floors and exterior courtyards or yards (reducing dust is one useful function of this). Dried cakes of cow dung (and sheep dung) are important cooking fuels in many parts of the world. While many of today think of dung as a waste product, it is often a valuable resource in traditional societies (and in addition to the uses already mentioned, is valuable as fertiliser, and in some rural areas today is used to produce methane for use as cooking gas).

       " 'The answer is largely going to hinge on just how \"flexible\" you are with your definition of \"industrialization.\" You\\'re going to have to be pretty flexible, because in most of the ways that most people define it, the answer\\'s a pretty solid \"no.\" But hey, let\\'s go over the pros and cons and see where we wind up: # PROS Economic Growth Song China undoubtedly experienced a degree of economic growth and prosperity that would be unmatched in the world until the 18th/19th century European Industrial Revolution. Its zenith is generally agreed to be the reign of its 6th emperor, Shenzong (r. 1048-1085). As always, it\\'s virtually an effort in futility to try to \"compare\" vastly different economies across huge swathes of time and space, but the figure most generally put forward is that Northern Song in the mid-to-late 11th century controlled something like 25-30% of the total global GDP. This tremendous growth came about, in significant part, because of a rather revolutionary reform to the taxation policies of the realm. Prior to the accession of the founding imperial brothers, Taizu and Taizong, dynastic taxation policy had been based solely around head and land taxes. That is to say, you\\'d pay annually for the number of people in your household, and the amount of land that you owned. The philosophy behind this is complicated, but we can boil it down to it being a fundamentally different economic philosophy that anything we\\'re used to, namely: that growth was neither the goal, nor even particularly desirable; instead stability is what should be sought in the realm\\'s economic planning. Of course, this tends to hit a brick wall when something unexpected (like a foreign invasion, natural disaster, or massive internal rebellion) crops up. Taxes tended to therefore be raise on the peasantry... and again... and again... until it was too much - ipso facto, there\\'s you cause for rebellion. So, that shifts under the Song policy to a policy of \"hey maybe let\\'s not tax the pants off of the peasant farmers, and instead try something craazy.\" That \"crazy\" idea is to tax trade - both internal & with foreign entities. And there\\'s a lot of pushback on this, since it generates crazy profit, which both makes the economy unstable and also makes the Confucians in the government feel all icky because they\\'ve got a real problem with commerce in general... but on the other hand, hey, profit is profit. It works like gangbusters. This massive economy led to rich trading ties with a large number of its neighbors - including Japan, Korea, and the Indian Ocean marketplace. But the most significant economic ties across the totality of the Song Dynasty would be those not of its own making. Rather, they would be it its competitor and rival states to the north - first the Liao Dynasty of the Khitan People, then the Jin of the Jurchen & the Tangut of Western Xia, and finally (& fatefully) the rising might of the Mongol Khans. Across the vast majority of its lifespan, the Song Dynasty\\'s emperors - both Northern and Southern - were devoting an absolutely tremendous percentage of its yearly GDP toward paying \"tribute costs\" for those northern powers to cease attacking it (it would then proceed time and again to shoot itself in its own foot on that front, but that\\'s another tale). Evidence of the efficacy of this economic shift play out in the straight monetary numbers. In 964 CE, for instance, export revenues were recorded as totaling 500,000 strings of cash-coins. Just a little more than 2 centuries later, in 1189, records show those export revenues at an incredible 65 million strings of cash. Population & Urbanization The Song Dynasty also saw a China far more urban than that any that had come before. Multiple cities across the empire could boast populations in excess of 1 million, sometimes even simultaneously. For instance, if one considers both the Jin capital of Zhongdu (mod. Beijing) and the S. Song capital Lin\\'an (mod. Hangzhou) to be \"Chinese\" cities at the same time (even as they\\'re under different regimes), then they\\'re both 1M at the same time. Increased urbanization leads to, of course, further upticks in technological innovations and novel distributions of labor. Other major urban centers included Kaifeng and Liaoyang. This urbanization combined with a policy of much freer movement among the populace led to another new need: a place to stay when on the move. Hence we see the effective \"invention\" of the concept of the motel as a stable business in this time period, as well. Technological Sophistication Song China absolutely sees an - er\\'hem - great leap forward in terms of science and technology. Here\\'s a partial list: moveable print typeface - ca. 1000 CE mechanical water clock - ca. 1090 CE paddlewheel ships - ca. 1135 CE magnetic compass - ca. 1150 CE water-powered textile-production machinery - ca. 1200 CE large (~200-600 tons) seaworthy transport craft - ca. 1200 CE Though paper was a much older invention (with industrial-scale production beginning ~ a millennium earlier in the mid-Han Dynasty), by the Song it had become such a staple, and so cheap to produce that it was used for things far beyond books, such as: toilet paper tea-bags disposable/single-use \"advertisements\" Gunpowder likewise far precedes the Song, though it is during this period that it is effectively weaponized into things like grenades, flashbombs, and gas bombs, rocket arrows, flamethrowers, and even primitive forms of \"torpedos\" (Not to mention the much more fun application as fireworks). Production You ask about mining, as though that is a specifically \"industrial\" action - but that\\'s not the case. Mining far, far precedes industry (and is, in fact, an absolute prerequisite). Mining during the Song, though, was absolutely done by man and animal power, and hydropower where available - but no jackhammers here. In terms of iron & steel production, Song output was - no huge surprise here - by far the largest in the world at the time. Estimates based off of tax receipts suggest that it may have been producing as much as 125,000 tons (127M kg) of iron per year by 1058 - a figure that would be surpassed by Great Britain only in the 1840s.',\n",
       " \"u/cthulhushrugged did an excellent job of covering the different economic and technological factors that answer your question, but I do want to push back a bit on their emphasis of the role of Wang Anshi and central government policy in the Song commercial revolution. Song China's economic expansion started before the New Policies and continued long after they had been repealed, with population growth (a proxy for economic growth) continuing well into the period of Jin-Song division. I describe some of the reasons behind this in this older post Otherwise, I agree with u/cthulhushrugged's characterization of Song China. It was very developed commercially, and may have been pushing against the upper limit of what could be achieved without exploiting new power sources like coal or oil, but it was still fundamentally an agrarian society.\",\n",
       " 'A lot of things to unpack here, as it is a very complicated point in Japanese history. First, no one openly opposed the \"restoration to direct rule\" by the Emperor. That was already agreed upon by both sides in the autumn of 1867. In reality, both sides must have known that power and decision making would continue to reside with the leading domains. While other domains played important parts that resulted in this circumstance, Satsuma and Chōshū were really the only ones who pushed for war, as if things continued the way they were going, the Tokugawa would remain the leaders of the new government. This seem to actually have been preferable to the leaders of the other domains, but was unacceptible to Satsuma and Chōshū. You can read about that here The other domains (Tosa, Echizen, Hiroshima) only joined Satsuma and Chōshū\\'s side when the emperor declared for Satsuma and Chōshū by allowing them to use a (newly-made) imperial flag in the middle of the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, which also caused many on the Tokugawa side (including branches of the Tokugawa family) to switch sides. The northeast domains were not opposed to the \"restoration to direct rule.\" Chōshū was out for Aizu\\'s blood, and the northeast came together to beg for Aizu\\'s forgiveness. Things went haywire and turned into open fighting for the northeast. See here After the war, abolishing the domains and samurai, rapid modernization, and universal conscription were pushed through by the leaders of the new government, who were front-line figures during the Bakumatsu. They were able to do this by quickly establishing the new goverment\\'s army from a core of Satsuma troops. Having just experienced the Boshin War and the harsh punishment delt to the loosers, no one wanted to risk rebelling against the new government. Note that this move was done without explicit consent of the Satsuma daimyō, who gave Saigo Takamori an earful when he realized what happened but could do nothing to change the course the government was heading. And the terms of the abolishment of the domains were fairly generous to the old domain leadership, though not to the average samurai. You can read about ex-samurai rebellions here There definately were a lot of samurai who helped defeat the Tokugawa who were angry with the way the country was heading. However it\\'s harder to say for the Seinan War. The leadership never expressed anything other than a feeling of injustice at the supposed attempt on Saigo\\'s life, but we know the movement quickly absorbed disgruntled samurai from southwestern Japan, many of whom must have been angry with their treatment by the new government. The Meiji oligarchy was predominately made of people from Satsuma and Chōshū. And while people from the defeated domains did participate in the new government they were kept away from positions of power. There were definately regional ties to political grouping as well. For instance, Itagaki Taisuke\\'s Liberal Party, which argued strongly against Satsuma and Chōshū\\'s monopoly on power, had a good portion of the Tosa leadership. And Aizu for one still hasn\\'t forgiven Satsuma and Chōshū.',\n",
       " 'I wrote an answer that touches on a similar question that might be worth checking out. The long and short is no, though. The industrial facilities that were evacuated were above all else military facilities specifically needed for the war effort, rather than industries in any larger sense. They were moved to industrial regions like Sverdlovsk or Kuzbass that had begun to develop starting with the First Five Year Plan, and most of these evacuated facilities were returned to their original locations after the war. In a broader context, while the Soviet Union did much to try to develop and settle the country east of the Urals even at its end the population was predominantly located west of the Urals For reference, the city of Ufa is just west of the mountain range. With the end of the USSR, a lot of the population has if anything shifted out of Siberia - citizens in remote regions stopped receiving a salary bonus for these postings, \"rust belt\" industrial areas have lost population, as well as cities set up for military industries and research. This has been partially offset in the region by areas with oil, gas, and mining industries.',\n",
       " \"I suppose we don't have to discuss the following basic two-tier division among the (contemporary) sources in detail. 1. Written evidence 1. Non-written evidence, such as archaeological as well as osteological, and further, gene evidence mainly found in the mass grave during the 14th century. 1: Written Evidence While several authors had already noticed the global scale of the ongoing outbreak of the Black Death in the middle of the outbreak itself (just before ca. 1350 CE), such as the mention of Chinese/ 'Indian' origin of the plague, no single contemporary text could cover the entire extent of the outbreak across Eurasia. Thus, our timeline/ map of the spread of the Black Death (linked to the map in History Today, largely based on Benedictow's monograph) is primarily modern reconstruction of the event, based on the patchwork of the contemporary (and some are even later) texts, as is often the case as such a global and significant event in history. It also means that we cannot generally rely on the written account on the Black Death for its spread into the area that lacked the reliable contemporary account, such as sub-Saharan Africa. The first and foremost problem of such a situation in the primary source is the difficulty of accessing and reading the relevant sources, consisting of diverse language, nature (thus also, different trustworthiness of their descriptions). Fortunately, we have two convenient primary source collections, summarized by Horrox and Aberth respectively, with an useful introduction, consisting not only of Latin, but also of various vernacular languages, and even some Byzantine and Islamic text (Horrox ed. 1994; Aberth ed. 2017). (Added:) The followings are some examples of the contemporary or near-contemporary key texts that narrated the early spread of the plague, mainly following the track of contemporary Mediterranean trade: Essay on the Report of the Pestilence (ca. 1348) by Abu Hafs Umar Ibn Al-Wardi (Aberth ed. 2017: 23-25). The History of the Disease (historia de morbo) (ca. 1356) by Gabrielle de Mussis (Horrox ed. 1994: 14-26; Aberth ed. 2017: 135f., though Aberth's 1st ed. features the excerpt of de Mussis more extensively). Chronicle (ca. 1361) by Michele da Piazza, Sicilian Monk (Horrox ed. 1994: 35-41; Aberth. ed. 2017: 80-84). It is true, however, even now researchers have continued their critical re-reading of these texts to improve their reconstruction of the geographical as well as chronological spread of the outbreak, as Green argues against the classical account, based on de Mussis' the transmission of the plague during the Siege in Crimean Peninsula (Green 2020). 2: Non-Written Evidence I summarized current scholars' use of non-written evidence, such as the archaeological excavation of the mass grave, gene analysis from the remains, and also land use in What effects of plagues and other huge epidemics can we see in archaeology? so if you are interested in them, please also refer to the linked thread.

       " 'So the idea that the Titans or their predecessors were the pantheon of older inhabitants of Greece was a relatively popular way of interpreting the mythology at one point, and those who still adhere to the theory may give you answers in the affirmative. But the modern consensus is heavily against that idea. The names of the Olympians have been found in some of the oldest Mycenaean writings and no evidence has been found of the Titans being primary deities. The origins of myths are examined through a combination of comparative mythology, comparative linguistics, and archaeology. A lot of myths can be traced along the different lines of language families, and much of the rest can be chalked up to cultural diffusion. A common theme in Indo-European religions is that the world was formed by primordial beings who were separate from and often were the ancestors of the primary pantheon. A number of Indo-European religions also had/have two different groups of deities in opposition to each other: the Greek Titans and Olympians, the Norse Aesir and Vanir, the Persian Ahuras and Daevas, the Vedic Asuras and Devas. The Titanochamy was also likely influenced by cultural diffusion. The theme of older gods and newer gods fighting for supremacy can be found across the Aegean Sea in Anatolia amongst the Indo-European Hittites in their myth the Song of Kurambi, as well as similarities with non-Indo-European Hurrian and Babylonian myths.',\n",

       " 'There is zero evidence that any American prisoners were held in Vietnam after 1973. It is merely a conspiracy theory. In the spring of 1973, 591 American POWs held by North Vietnam & allied states were released and returned home, approximately in line with what the Department of Defense estimated for the number of remaining prisoners. However, the public and the families of MIA servicemen noticed that this still left several hundred people unaccounted for against the claim of 1,500 missing or prisoner the Nixon administration had announced during the Paris Peace conference. As the US withdrew, any sense of closure or celebration at the release of the prisoners was clouded by subsequent events, such as the Watergate scandal and the fall of South Vietnam to Communist forces in 1975. As you mention, several eccentric characters held fundraisers in the 80s to finance POW recovery missions in Southeast Asia. These expeditions had similar results to those missions which periodically seek out Bigfoot or the Loch Ness monster: none of them ever found any prisoners, prison camps, or human remains. The Department of Defense has been working since the end of the war to trace what happened to the MIA cases, and locate human remains using forensic teams with the cooperation of Vietnamese authorities. Of 1,973 original Vietnam MIA cases, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) has identified and repatriated the remains of 728 cases, and listed 470 as non-recoverable cases: where there is conclusive evidence the person died but there is no possibility of recovering any remains (such as a pilot crashing in the ocean). The DPAA originally listed 196 cases as “last known alive”: people who were not confirmed killed, but went missing and were never seen again. Of these, 177 have been confirmed dead by further investigations, with the remains of 51 returned home. Only 19 of those last-known-alive cases are still unresolved. Of course, a single missing person case is heart-wrenching to the family members affected, but compare these 19 missing over the course of a 20-year conflict in a country covered in tropical jungle against 72,000 US MIA in World War II. And of course, 19 missing without a trace is a far cry from the claims of POW activists that hundreds of live prisoners still remained in the 80s & 90s. However, the quiet and patient work of these forensic investigators is a lot less exciting than the idea of Chuck Norris breaking prisoners out of a secret camp. POW activist groups have persisted in claiming that live prisoners were kept in Vietnam after the war. There are two main groups: the “National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia” and the “National Alliance of Families for the Return of America’s Missing Servicemen”. Supposedly the National Alliance of Families is more extreme in its claims, but these two activist groups both claim on their websites that there are live American prisoners in Vietnam. Today. In the early 90s, a US Senate committee led by Vietnam veterans John Kerry & John McCain held hearings on the live prisoner issue. America was considering normalizing relations with Vietnam at this time, and POW/MIA activist groups were crying out for the US government not to do so unless all the prisoners were returned. The committee held over 1,000 interviews, took 200 sworn depositions, and sent investigators led by Kerry on multiple trips to Southeast Asia, but no prisoners were ever found. No one was able to substantiate these claims with any documentary evidence, name someone still being held, produce a Vietnamese witness, or provide any other proof that POWs had been left behind. The committee closed its proceedings in 1993, reporting that there was no proof of live prisoners in Vietnam. They did not rule out the possibility that some prisoners may have been left behind after 1973, but reported that: “The Committee cannot prove a negative, nor have we entirely given up hope that one or more U.S. POWs may have survived. As mentioned above, some reports remain to be investigated and new information could be forthcoming. But neither live-sighting reports nor other sources of intelligence have provided grounds for encouragement, particularly over the past decade. The live-sighting reports that have been resolved have not checked out; alleged pictures of POWs have proven false; purported leads have come up empty; and photographic intelligence has been inconclusive, at best” The POW activists were not convinced, and for years afterward they continued to smear both Kerry and McCain for supposedly participating in the cover-up conspiracy. Although they’ve produced zero hard evidence of post-1973 live prisoners, these groups have never recanted their claims or admitted that they were wrong, despite the Senate committee findings and the work of the the forensic investigators (the National Alliance says the remains repatriated by the DPAA are fake). Despite the fact that they are essentially conspiracy theorists, the POW activist groups have attracted a lot of friends in high places. The National Alliance of Families promoted an act of Congress in 2000, the “Bring Them Home Alive Act” which grants automatic refugee status to any Southeast Asian national who “personally delivers into the custody of the United States Government a living American Vietnam War POW/MIA”. In the subsequent 20 years, it doesn’t appear that anyone has ever claimed this reward. Additionally, if the cover-up was on the US side, there would have been State Department and DoD documents which could be uncovered under freedom of information act requests, thousands of witnesses, and motivated whistleblowers available to testify about this shocking betrayal. No one has ever come forward with credible evidence in the 45 years after the fall of Saigon.

       " \"Finland didn't win. They lost both of their wars against the Soviet Union (the Winter War and the Continuation War). When the Soviet Union began the Winter War, they set up a puppet government, the Finnish Democratic Republic (the Kuusinen government, in Terijoki), and apparently intended to quickly conquer Finland on behalf of this government. When the expected-to-be-a-few-weeks war dragged on for months, with a growing prospect of British and French intervention which would at least drag Norway and Sweden into the war, the Soviet Union wanted out ASAP. Once they won battlefield victories which (a) restored the prestige of the Red Army, at least in their own eyes, and (b) forced Finland to accept a peace deal they weren't happy with (but was better than continued war and conquest), a peace was agreed. See my answer in https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/koba2b/why_did_the_ussr_launch_a_war_with_the_finns_in/ for more on why the Soviets were in a hurry to finish the Winter War (and also start it in the first place). The casualties in the Winter War were quite lopsided. Finnish casualties were about 70,000 (of which about 26,000 were killed), and Soviet casualties were probably about 350,000, 5 times higher than the Finnish casualties (estimates of the Soviet casualties vary from about 300,000 to over 1,000,000, but the high estimates are very unlikely to be correct). However, having a favourable ratio of casualties is not the same as winning the war. Similarly, in the Continuation War, the ratio of casualties favoured Finland, about 225,000 vs about 900,000, but the Soviet Union still won. As for the Continuation War, the second part of Finland's WWII, Finland halted the final offensives by the Soviet Union at considerable cost to the Soviets (and also to the Finnish forces involved), and the Soviets had some very important distractions, like trying to defeat Germany as quickly as possible. In the final large battles, the Soviets had at least 5 divisions wrecked: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hqesfv/finland_on_losing_side/ and while they had plenty more to commit to Finland, Germany was the important enemy.

Many suspect that their goal was conquest and the imposition of a puppet government, possibly to be followed by absorption into the Soviet Union (as Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania were).

       " \"Viktor Frankl was a fascist and a nazi collaborator. He was a member of the Fatherland Front from 1934, the far-right austrofascist party. Just to be clear here, the Austrofascists were not Nazis, and weren't friendly with the Nazis. They were anti-democratic, Christian fascists, yes, but they were at the same time seen by many as the only real alternative to, well, Austria joining Nazi Germany. The Frankl biography by Timothy Pytell has this to say: Since the civil war in 1934 led to Austrofascism, and the Socialist Party was outlawed, the political options for Viennese Jews became extremely limited. The most obvious alignment for Jews was to support the authoritarian, Christian government. The choice was clear, because the most likely successor to the Austrian corporate state was not social democracy, but National Socialism. Thus, “Jews of nearly all political shades” dissociated from the Socialists and declared “their loyalty to the new Austrian state and the Fatherland Front. One might term such behavior opportunistic … but it was merely pragmatic.” Frankl’s political allegiances are not explicit. We know he became a member of the Fatherland Front on 23 February 1934, and was described as “politically perfect” on 8 February 1937 in a survey of Fatherland Front party membership. However, it is likely that Frankl’s membership in the Front was mandated by his position at the state hospital Am Steinhof. Signifi cantly, the Front’s membership survey is the only document in his Gauachten fi le (these fi les were created by the Nazi party and described individuals’ ideological orientation) in the State Archive in Vienna.6 It also appears the full documentation is missing because many fi les were cleansed after the war. You can learn two things from Pytell: First, there may have been pragmatic, opportunistic reasons for Frankl to join the Austrofascists, even for him as a former social democrat. Additionally, there may have been professional reasons for this. Second, the Gauachten references an earlier document from 1937 describing him as politically perfect. So this reference was not one by the Nazis about Frankl's allegiance to Nazism, but one by the Austrofascists about Frankl's allegiance to Austrofascism. This is to say: Your interlocutor seems to have some stuff mixed up, although some pop history sources has the story essentially like they told you, so it doesn't seem like it's their error. I do not know anything about Frankl's time after Austrofascism though. Edit: An article in a jewish magazine that makes similar claims to your interlocutor can be found here and a debate that challenges some of it here\",\n",
       " 'Victor Frankl was imprisoned in Theresienstadt between 1942 and 1944. Theresienstadt was a sort of hybrid between concentration camp, transit camp, and ghetto established in a garrison city in Bohemia. Many of its prisoners were elderly German and Austrian Jews. Having an \"elders ghetto\" supported the Nazi regime\\'s ruse that the Jews being deported to Eastern Europe were actually going to work at some new settlement, not being murdered, since it would have seemed unlikely for older people to be performing manual labor. Another group of Austrian and German Jews sent to Theresienstadt were disabled or decorated war veterans or people who were culturally or professionally prominent -- the reason for this being that their disappearance might provoke unwanted attention and maybe even international condemnation. Prisoners at Theresienstadt faced starvation, disease, forced labor, overcrowded and unsanitary conditions, and ultimately, deportation and murder at Auschwitz and elsewhere. Theresienstadt was absolutely not a \"low-security ghetto for upper-class Jews,\" and the commenter here is reproducing Nazi propaganda that characterized it as a spa town the regime generously granted Jewish retirees. According to Timothy Pytell\\'s article (which the commenter mentions, it\\'s called \"The Missing Pieces of the Puzzle: A Reflection on the Odd Career of Viktor Frankl\", published in 2000), Frankl worked as a psychiatrist in Theresienstadt and helped new arrivals acclimate to ghetto life. He also established what Pytell called a \"suicide intelligence network,\" intended to identify and intervene with people suspected of being suicidal. Preventing suicide seemed to be one of Frankl\\'s highest goals, so this makes sense. However, suicide in Theresienstadt was strictly forbidden, it also served the Nazis\\' purpose of keeping prisoners alive under unbearable conditions so their labor could be exploited. Since Frankl was a doctor and appears to have been involved in the administration of the public health department at Theresienstadt, he may have had access to certain benefits that prisoners lower than he in the internal hierarchy wouldn\\'t have had. He would have also been faced with morally fraught choices. Again, I think it\\'s grotesque to say that this would make Frankl a Nazi collaborator. Pytell writes that Frankl leaves his readers with the impression that he was in Auschwitz for a significant time, while he barely mentions Theresienstadt at all. Apparently, he was in Auschwitz for only a few days before being transferred to a subcamp of Dachau. I\\'ve never read Frankl\\'s books, so I don\\'t know if this is a fair reading of his work, and if so, I don\\'t know why he might have made this choice. Maybe he (or his editors) were using \"Auschwitz\" as a synecdoche for all his experiences during the Holocaust, assuming that the public would be more familiar with that name than they would be with Theresienstadt. Pytell criticizes Frankl for implying that he could \"capture the reality of experience in Auschwitz\" without having been faced with \"the worst of the horrors of the camps.\" Having not actually read Frankl, I can\\'t comment on this -- maybe he did misrepresent himself in a way that makes his work less credible -- but I would not say that Frankl is less of a Holocaust survivor because he was in Dachau and Theresienstadt for longer than he was in Auschwitz.',\n",
       " 'Greetings! This is an interesting question indeed, as it ties into the grand notion of keeping the \"Great Liner\" (to borrow Churchill\\'s phrase) of Empire afloat. For starters though, it is a good idea that you acquaint yourself somewhat adequately on the extent of actual \"control\" in the British Empire, as historians generally agree that Whitehall often had very little \"real\" power in much of the Empire, where their subsidiary colonial ministries, economic agents, and even entrepreneurial individuals. This thread I weighed in on regarding the maintenance of British rule in various places might serve as a good starting point. Let\\'s begin by going through your question in segments. Note: because your question specified (fittingly) \"the height\" of the British Empire, this response pertains to the period from 1830 - 1900, the so called \"Pax Britannica\" of the Empire\\'s history. On Military Matters \"Once the British Empire became world-wide, the sun never set on its crises.\" - Historian Jack Gallagher Question segment: If you need gunpowder in New Delhi and 2 frigates in Jamaica and more troops in Hong Kong and some sabres in Australia... The simple answer? There\\'s always a closer supply point than Britain. In the case of the former, the British Raj in India had one of the largest contingents of the British Army throughout much of the 19th century. In fact, after the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, the government in London actually increased the size of this contingent by permanently stationing 60,000-70,000 soldiers and officers of the British Army in India at all times, ensuring that there was a ratio of 1:2 in terms of British soldiers to local Indian recruits (that is, for every 2 Sepoys there was at least 1 Tommy, both conveniently paid for by Indian taxpayers and not British ones.) Thus at any given period after 1857, the total manpower under British command in India numbered somewhere between 180,000 to 200,000 troops, a massive force which held a crucial strongpoint and linchpin of the Empire. What about other, less critical outposts? There was always a British garrison present in some form of another (usually supplemented by local auxiliaries and battalions) to maintain order and stave off mass rebellion until more troops could be sent post-haste from the nearest major station. See this map here in John Darwin\\'s excellent publication Unfinished Empire: The Global Expansion of Britain, for more detailed numbers of those garrisons. It was colonial troops from India which spearheaded the China campaigns during both Opium Wars (1839-1842, 1856-1860), and communications were assisted by this point in the century by a telegraph network connecting all the spokes of Empire in far-flung stations (from the Falklands to the Cape to Hong Kong) back to the \"nerve centre\" of London. Communications which may once have taken several days (or even weeks) to travel by sail from hub to hub now took mere seconds or hours. Of course, we cannot overlook the importance of railways and that \"Clapham Junction\" (as John Darwin puts it) of the Empire: the Suez Canal. The British, in being such an industrial-technological powerhouse of the Industrial Revolution, had also given themselves the means with which to draw closer the colonies and bridgeheads of their Empire. So to wrap-up this first bit of the response, as Historian Ashley Jackson neatly sums it up: \"Though there was never force available everywhere, and collaborative relationships and the skill of district officials were the day-to-day backbone of the system, force was certainly present, even if it was latent.\" \"The point is that although the \\'dread of our power\\' was always in part illusory, it was never wholly so.\" Britain was not often the gathering point of a massive colonial expedition, or indeed the source of reinforcements and resupply. The grand \"highways of Empire\" portrayed on this map ensured that, at least logistically, the empire could be secured from other depots and garrisons rather than relying solely on the \"mother country\" in Europe. The next part in this duo logy of comments will focus on the decision-making with regards to the colonies, and how the British constantly kept abreast of developments on the continent. (Sources for both parts will follow in another reply comment).',\n",
       " 'The Wheels of Trade Parts of this response adapted from a previous one on maintenance of British power, as linked in the first comment \"To the empire coloured red on the map, the City of London had added an empire glued together by debt and defended by gold.\" - Historian John Darwin Question segment: \"How did they hold onto all those disparate places for so long especially when the high end supplies needed could not be produced locally but had to travel from Britain?\" It would not take anyone a ridiculous amount of reading to ascertain that the wheels of industry and economics drove the expansion of empire to a significant extent, and in later centuries (most prominently during the 19th), that this created a \"positive feedback loop\", in which raw materials from the colonies were imported back to the Home Islands for manufacturing and processing into more valuable supplies, and then exported back to the colonies or other trade partners (most notably Europe, where as much as 1/3 of all exports from Britain were destined to end up in the late 1800s and early 1900s.) Further, the British were not only vastly advantaged by their commercial prowess, but also benefited immensely from supporting the rise of a new global economy. John Darwin on this boost to British influence: \"As more and more regions were drawn into the commercial economy, specialising in the exports of staples (in which their market advantage was greatest) and buying more imports, their need for exchange banks, insurance companies, shippers, and shipbrokers, as well as the hardware of railways, harbours, ships, and cables, rose astronomically. These were services in which the British enjoyed a long lead, and through which they could levy a large rent on the new streams of trade...This was the setting in which London asserted its global supremacy. With such massive economic power at its beck-and-call, the British government was able to keep the colonies on a tight dependence for British imports and exports, but also raised the capital which (to varying extents) found its way back into the development of the colonies through \"foreign\" investment. Even into the early 1900s, as the \"white settler colonies\" (later dominions) were granted their own rights to government, they remained closely bound to the Pound Sterling. Ashley Jackson on this \"lifeline\": \"these territories Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa remained dependent upon Britain because Britain was responsible for their foreign affairs and defense, purchased the lion\\'s share of their exports, supplied their imports, provided requisite inward investment, and held their sterling balances in London.\" The grip on colonies was even greater in parts of the Empire which were of great concern to London. In the British Raj for example by the late 1800s, it absorbed the largest share of Britain\\'s main export, cotton cloth. This in part due to British rule forcing open the market and forbidding tariffs which would increase the popularity of Indian textiles (a market for which the continent was once the envy of Europe, and a tragic tale in the story of Empire which I highly recommend reading more about). The British even went so far as to fix the value of the Indian rupee to that of the Pound Sterling around 1900, ensuring that the \"jewel in the crown of the empire\" remained economically subservient and (to a degree) reliant on the mother country back in England. Economically then, the British tightened and often secured their hold on far-flung colonies and landmasses by quite literally holding all the cards of capital. It was London which served as the economic headquarters of an industrial powerhouse with markets and shareholders dotted across the world. It was the City of London filled with offices of the all-important network builders (physical and commercial) that held the purse strings of all Britain\\'s colonies in the late 1800s. And it was the London of Whitehall that later took advantage of these assets to ensure continued ties and obedience to the crown. Yet no discussion of the British Empire can be considered even remotely complete without acknowledging those \\'wooden walls\\' (later iron walls) who patrolled the sea lanes and represented Westminister\\'s will across the oceans: The Royal Navy. The Senior Service \"The potent theatre of a British fleet at exercise, with its precise, silent drill and effortless seamanship, struck fear into the hearts of rivals. Because the Royal Navy was credited with enormous power, the security of the British Empire was maintained for a pittance.\" - Historian Andrew Lambert Question segment: \"while the threat levels from Britain’s rivals in Europe as well as the local populations was constantly fluid, yet the decision making of what to do about it, took place in London and took weeks or months to communicate back and forth?\" The Royal Navy would be the enforcer, protector, and oftentimes expander of the British Empire wherever crises or revolt threatened to break out. It was gunboats of the Royal Navy which blockaded the Yangtze River during the First Opium War, forcing the Emperor of the \"Celestial Empire\" to come to peace terms with these \"Western barbarians\". Squadrons of the Royal Navy were anchored at bases scattered at critical junctures of the empire, where rivals (mostly from European rivals, though also at times from colonies seething with dissent) were able to be monitored and threats pre-empted. This map (on the same file as the one linked in the previous comment) showed just how omnipresent the Royal Navy was in 1881, and this presence would continue to exist until after the First World War and the efforts at naval reduction. Historian John Darwin likens this arm of the British Empire to a key-holder, even before the advent of steam-powered dreadnoughts and submarines: \"The exceptional conjecture of 1815 the end of the Napoleonic Wars turned Britain\\'s arduous campaign of empire defense into a geopolitical triumph. With the Cape, Mauritius and Ceylon (with its storm-proof harbour at Trincomali), they held all the main stations on the trunk route to India. from Malta\\'s Grand Harbour they could watch the eastern Mediterranean, and the \\'short\\' road (as yet overland) to the east. With these as well as their Irish, North America and Caribbean sea bases, they now held the keys to lock up the world in a sailing ship age. With naval supremacy in their hands, the British were able to maximise their economic gains of empire, and connect the spokes of the wheel to the center at London far more effectively. It was this constant nuisance in the side of European rivals such as France, Russia and (after 1871) Germany, which upset their designs for expansion into lands which were dangerously close to territories where the Union Jack flew. Conclusion To the last and the largest Empire, To the map that is half unrolled!- Extract from Rudyard Kipling\\'s poem The Native Born, published 1895, celebrating the English who were reared in the colonies, and acknowledging their ties (like the physical, commercial, and military empire) to Britain. There did not exist a centralised system of communication, reinforcement, or supply throughout the British Empire in the 1800s; rather, a decentralised and colony-specific system by which troops, ships, and trade flowed throughout the imperial network. Britain may have later commanded significant influence over these logistical matters as well as shouldered, to considerable but not neccessarily total extent, the burden of decision-making; but the word of London (though increasingly faster in dispatch time), was ultimately influenced by the nature of various colonial circumstances, and was often dictated by the representatives of Britannia on the ground. Hope this response helped, and feel free to ask any other follow-ups you might have!',\n",
       " 'Land speculation was considered a lucrative investment for the gentry during the latter decades of the 18th century and in the early 19th century. This was especially true in the upper South, where tobacco prices were consistently low, other cash crops were difficult to consistently produce, and the monetary demands of their lifestyle meant most were heavily indebted to British (mostly Scottish) creditors (see Woody Holton’s Forced Founders for how this influenced elite participation in the Revolution). Land speculation was so vital that the Proclamation of 1763, limiting English settlement to east of the Appalachians, was a major driver of American resistance to the Crown across social class. For the gentry, it threatened them with bankruptcy, since many (including Washington) had already heavily invested in the Ohio Valley. Properly speculating and investing in land meant being able to establish strong legal claims backed up by verified maps and plots determined by accurate surveying. For men like Jefferson and Washington, who grew up near Virginia’s western edge of substantial European settlement, it was a given that they would want to invest in land and protect that investment with proper surveying. For Lincoln, living along the western edge of settlement in the 19th century, concerns about accurate land claims meant surveying remained a popular and necessary occupation. It was no longer a gentleman’s prerogative by the 1830s, but was highly valuable. In Lincoln’s particular case, his family left Kentucky because that state based land claims on landmarks rather than traditional surveys. This meant that claims were often contested and lost as the landscape changed and those with power and connections could abuse the court system to their advantage. Lincoln’s father lost his first claim and eventually moved the family to Indiana to find a more stable government.',\n",
       " 'Something to keep in mind and to add to what u/Toroceratops provided is that it was much more the gentry profession thing than it was Proclomation of \\'63 or land speculation. While those absolutely put Washington\\'s holdings in jeopardy, he had started surveying as a teen at Mt Vernon as a continuation of his studies in mathematics. His neighbor happened to be William Fairfax, and in the 1740s he tagged along with him for a major surveying expedition made at the request of William\\'s first cousin, Thomas Fairfax, 6th Baron Cameron, better known simply as Lord Fairfax, the man who at one point owned most of Virginia including massive holdings in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Fun Fact! Parking in a small lot at Bootens Gap off of Skyline Drive in Shenandoah National Park, you can take a short hike down Conway Fire Road and burried in the underbrush just off trail you can find a small stone with a plaque marking this point of the Fairfax Line. With a big massive boundary of his holdings set, they needed more surveys and a 16 year old Washington joined the effort, the start of his professional career as a surveyor. His last survey happened in 1799, again at Mt Vernon, and only 6 weeks before his death. He surveyed tens of thousands of acres in his time as a surveyor, and served in that official role in Culpeper County. He\\'s also said to have thrown a stone over Natural Bridge, a 215 foot high natural rock formation bridge in Virginia, from the creek below (and you can still see a \"GW\" carved in the rock, allegedly from the man himself when he surveyed that land). Segway.... Jefferson purchased Natural Bridge later on and held it for some time, desiring to but never actually making a home on the site. His survey story is similar, and also starts in the late 1750s. His father, Peter, was never educated but was self taught. He paired up with Joseph Fry, who was an official surveyor, and worked under him under a project in 1746. Pleased with his skills, Fry and his new partner set out to define the border between VA and NC. Accomplished, they next set out to map the colony of Virginia and this project, finished in 1751 when TJ was only eight years old and running barefoot at Shadwell, was the first map to include the Allegheny Mountains (first published in 1753 as the Fry-Jefferson Map Fry passed the next year (\\'54) and as one of his final acts he bequeathed his surveyors tools to his partner, Peter Jefferson. Jefferson was done surveying himself as well, having returned to Shadwell and becoming a magistrate for Albemarle County. He died only three years later, in 1757, and his tools plus those of Fry (likely) all went to his son, Thomas (we know at least some did but believe they all did). He said of his father; My father’s education had been quite neglected, but being of a strong mind, sound judgment and eager after information, he read much and improved himself insomuch that he was chosen with Joshua Fry professor of Mathm.Mathematics in W.William & M.Mary college to continue the boundary line between Virginia & N. Carolina ... and was afterwards employed with the same mr Fry to make the 1st Map of Virginia which had ever been made, that of Capt Smith being merely a conjectural sketch. they possessed excellent materials for so much of the country as is below the blue ridge; little being then known beyond that ridge. Another tale, this one about the border survey of VA/NC, was passed down to and then from TJ\\'s grandkids; Colonel Jefferson and his companions had often to defend themselves against the attacks of wild beasts during the day, and at night found but a broken rest, sleeping – as they were obliged to do for safety – in trees. ... Jefferson\\'s courage did not once flag, but living upon raw flesh, or whatever could be found to sustain life, he pressed on and persevered until his task was accomplished. Jefferson the son held his father in high regard, had his tools, and possessed a high quality education for his time and area. And, unlike Washington, he spent his whole life on the frontier of English settlements, at the absolute edge of the empire. His choice of profession was almost preset, but not satiated with that he chose to pursue a legal education while in Williamsburg, later also following in his footsteps of becoming a judge in Albemarle (Washington also served as a county magistrate, btw). So it was primarily a result, at least in the case of these two, as being a gentry profession that was almost a given to continue ones studies of mathematics. The fact that these specific two went on to be so famous is happenstance, yet the odds of a 18th century surveyor being an influential person was pretty good. Neither would ultimately define themselves as surveyors, being a stepping stone early in their careers.',\n",
       " 'At least in medieval Europe--wax tablets! Think of, sort of, a picture frame with a layer of wax spread across it, and some kind of stylus if possible. These were used for temporary communication and rough drafts and such, especially in the era of rather expensive parchment. Probably the most \"famous\" (...lol) use of wax tablets is recorded in Eadmer\\'s Life of Anselm of Canterbury, an 11th century bishop and one of the most important theologians of the Middle Ages, and it describes how Anselm was almost only 75% of his role as one of the most important theologians of the Middle Ages. One night in the middle of the night, Anselm had a sudden flash of (divine, of course) inspiration for how to write the book he had been struggling for quite some time to write. He grabbed for wax tablets to scribble it down immediately, then handed it off to another monk. Who promptly lost them. Anselm tried again. This time he trusted nobody with them, and it seems, stacked them up next to him this other night. And woke up in the morning with the tablets strewn about the floor. Eadmer doesn\\'t give any further details about whether they were out of order, or partially erased, and so forth. One way or another, Anselm painstakingly rescued his second draft out of the pieces. And after composing this third draft (whether just putting pieces in the right order, or filling in missing bits as well), he had other monks do the dirty work immediately and get the thing onto parchment.

       " 'Large numbers of Ulster Scots (commonly called “Scots-Irish” or “Scotch-Irish” in the US) migrated to America during the colonial period: at least 250,000 came between 1717-1775, which according to David Hackett Fisher, was the largest wave of colonial immigration to America prior to independence. Scots-Irish culture is commonly associated with the South, but they also moved into northern states as well. Delaware & Pennsylvania were their first ports of entry, and there’s a wide range of place names throughout Pennsylvania and New York (Scotland, Carlilse, Donegal, Derry, Ulster County NY, Orange Country NY) which indicate traces of Scots-Irish settlers. By the time of independence, they could be found throughout the American colonies and were often among the first white settlers in frontier regions. Someone else could speak more to the construction of American national identity in the colonial period and early republic, but in general, distinct ethnic identities that we\\'d think of today (German-American, Irish-American) did not last very long in the early United States: people most often identified as American or White, and by the time of the Civil War many of the Scots-Irish families had been in the US more than 100 years. I am not aware of any Scots-Irish writers at the time of the Civil War specifically decrying the bloodshed between Scots-Irish people, rather than the nation as a whole. In answer to your part B, not sure if your timeline or terminology is confused: the Confederacy was formed in 1861, and the American War of Independence was fought 1775-1783 so the Confederacy was not around during the time of independence. Regarding opposition to independence among Scots-Irish people, during the fight for American Independence, there were people called “tories” or “loyalists” who opposed independence, but the Scots-Irish were not overrepresented in their ranks. Leyburn’s history of the Scots-Irish reports that support for Independence among the Scots-Irish was \"practically unanimous\". The one exception to this was the South Carolina backcountry, which was settled in the 1730s-1760s predominantly by Scots-Irish people, and saw violent conflict between loyalists and patriots. About 1/3rd of South Carolina’s population stayed loyal to the crown (the 2nd highest among the 13 colonies, after New York), with the backcountry region about evenly split. However, historical research on this subject has not found an ethnic explanation for why a person supported one side or the other (see references Klein & Moore below), there were Scots-Irish people on both sides.

       " 'There\\'s not really a good answer to this, because essentially we don\\'t think of her that way because people historically haven\\'t thought of her that way. Late medieval and Early Modern English/British royal history is a lot more contentious than most European countries\\' in that same timespan. Yes, civil wars or usurpations happened here and there, but afterward the succession typically seems to have been wrapped up and proceeded in an orderly fashion. Isabel of Castile, for instance, won the throne as the result of a declaration that the true heir was illegitimate and then a civil war; there was no question that her children should succeed her, and no rivals related to the true heir threatened them a generation or two later. In England, the succession was in crisis much of the time from the deposition of Richard II in 1399 to the accession of James I in 1603. Richard\\'s designated heir was his cousin Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, but he was deposed by a different cousin, Henry Bolingbroke, who became Henry IV. That went okay for a couple of generations (Henry V, Henry VI), and then they were tripped up by the Wars of the Roses, which pitted Henry VI\\'s family (the Lancastrians) against the descendants of Edmund Mortimer (the House of York). Henry VI is seen as switching back and forth as king with the Yorkist Edward IV depending on which side was winning, but could also be represented as simply co-existing claims. Edward IV is considered as being succeeded by his son, Edward V, one of the Princes in the Tower, and then his brother Richard III. The Lancastrian claim was taken up by Henry VI\\'s cousin, who defeated Richard III and became Henry VII. And of course his son, Henry VIII, had plenty of problems with succession, being followed by his son (Edward VI), his daughter (Mary I, who, as you know, fought her way to the throne), and his second daughter (Elizabeth I), who never named an heir and was succeeded by James I, the son of her cousin and rival. That is a LOT of back and forth. That much back and forth means that you have to do more than just win battles to cement your legitimacy - you have to manage public opinion. It was tremendously important for everyone who became the monarch to portray themselves as the most legitimate king/queen. In some cases this wasn\\'t too hard, but in others ... Henry VII, for instance, was not descended from an English king through legitimate lines. Part of what helped out Henry VII and his descendants was portraying Richard III as an evil monster (see Shakespeare\\'s version), so that by defeating him, Henry VII was a hero worthy of the kingdom. Edward V had been a child when his father died, was never crowned, and was declared illegitimate and therefore not eligible for kingness a few months later - yet he was still considered a king, with a number after his name, most likely to emphasize Richard III\\'s wickedness in disinheriting and murdering a true king. Jane Grey, on the other hand, muddled the succession. Legally, she had every right to be queen, because Edward VI\\'s \"device for the succession\" named her and her male heirs to come after him, due to her Protestant faith and because there were literally no appropriate men in the wider royal family. But Mary\\'s point was a) I get to be queen because the people have risen up and supported me, because b) I am the sister of the last king and daughter of the king before him, and I have the greatest right to be on the throne. Admitting that Jane was a proper queen was not helpful for Tudor propaganda. She also had little support, was only considered queen for about a week, and was never crowned. And because the episode of her \"reign\" was so minimized by Mary, who wanted the legitimacy of following her brother, as was the norm, she has gone down in history as a non-queen or a novelty. She\\'s \"the Nine Days\\' Queen\", but not Jane I.',\n",
       " 'Modern evolutionary thought predates Darwin. What Darwin contributed was a plausible mechanism that could drive evolution, and plentiful evidence. The idea of a relationship between humans and great apes also predated Darwin. One of the earlier writers on evolution in early modern Europe was Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, who included a discussion \"de la dégénération des animaux\" in the 14th volume of his Natural History (Histoire Naturelle). He presented an idea that is often used today by Creationists to reconcile our observations of evolution with Biblical Creationism, that of \"creation of kinds\", where, for example, one type of cat was created at creation, which then evolved into the many species of cats seen today. While Buffon\\'s title suggests that this was degeneration from the original type, he did consider the possibility of improvement. He considered, and debated with his peers, where humans and great apes can from such a common ancestor. He decided \"no\". One of his debatees, James Burnett, Lord Monboddo, decided \"yes\", and is perhaps the first to suggest that humans and great apes evolved, in the modern sense, from a common ancestor (of course, pre-Darwinian and without a proposed mechanism). Monboddo was notably evolutionary in his thinking, and had long worked on the evolution of languages. He took the step from the evolution of languages to the evolution of organisms. Rousseau had earlier speculated on the close relationship between great apes and humans, and suggested they shared an evolutionary kinship. For more on Rousseau and evolution, and evolutionary though of his times, see: Wokler, R. , \"Perfectible Apes in Decadent Cultures: Rousseau\\'s Anthropology Revisited\", Daedalus 107, 107-134. https://www.jstor.org/stable/20024567 The anatomical similarity had been noted before, but humans were usually considered separate from other animals. From a creationist perspective, whether existing species had all been created in the beginning, or had evolved from \"kinds\", humans could be separate, with no evolutionary relationship with other animals. There were questions about creation and evolution of humans: did all modern humans descend from a common ancestor (i.e., Adam), or had multiple races been created? Ideas like this are often invoked by modern white supremacists, for racist ends, and racism was a likely motive for some in the past who suggested separate creation of multiple races. Even the evolutionary-minded would often rank human races in order of merit, with Europeans at the top, and human races subdivided from paler to darker in order of decreasing believed quality. Those who proposed an evolutionary relationship between humans and great apes often simply considered them as even more extremely degenerate descendants of Adam. A close relationship between humans and apes was often put to racist ends, to place black peoples closer to apes than to white people on an evolutionary spectrum. This still goes on today, with, for example recent labelling of (ex-)president Obama as an ape, and similar insults hurled at Italy\\'s first black cabinet minister in 2013, Congo-born Cécile Kyenge (who suffered further abuse for her great crime of being female). Here was a key difference that Rousseau proposed from earlier \"evolutionary\" thought: humans came from an originally primitive state, and all of our \"superiority\" over great apes, such as language, fancy cognition, technology, etc., came later. There were even earlier ideas about a relationship between humans and apes (and monkeys), but usually these were quite different from Enlightenment and modern evolutionary ideas. For example, some legends explained the origin of monkeys as humans who had been changed into monkeys as a punishment by god: Diamandopoulos, A. A., & Goudas, C. P. , \"Human and ape: the legend, the history and the DNA\", Hippokratia 11, 92–94. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2464272/ The attitudes of people who live alongside great apes varies a lot. Some see them simply as stealers-of-food and/or as food to be hunted. Others accord them special status in their myths. For example, the Bangando people of Cameroon tell that apes/monkeys warned them of an attack by the Ndzimou people, and guided them through the forest and to hiding places. Because of this, they adopted apes/monkeys as their clan totem, and do not eat monkeys or apes. Other peoples have stories of apes once having been equal to humans, and then punished by the gods for some sin (similar to other stories mentioned above). Other peoples treat them with caution, as guardians of the forest where they live, just as humans are guardians of their own farms and lands. Others believe that their dead are reincarnated as gorillas.

       " 'Well I can tell you, from personal experience, that the articles about the Mongols and the crusades on Wikipedia are a huge mess, thanks to one extremely prolific editor who insisted there was an alliance between both sides and made thousands of edits across several articles around 2006-2007. This was way back in the days where I was active on Wikipedia too...I guess I can\\'t really get into the details of how a Wikipedia article is made, since it\\'s all personal anecdotes, but nevertheless, the quote you\\'re referring to is: \"The kings of France and Navarre, taking to heart the situation in the Holy Land, and decorated with the Holy Cross, are readying themselves to attack the enemies of the Cross. You wrote to us that you wished to join your father-in-law (the Greek emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos) to assist the Latins. We abundantly praise you for this, but we cannot tell you yet, before having asked to the rulers, what road they are planning to follow. We will transmit to them your advice, so as to enlighten their deliberations, and will inform your Magnificence, through a secure message, of what will have been decided.\" This quote was copied into the Clement IV article in October 2007, directly from the Franco-Mongol alliance article, where it had been added by the aforementioned prolific editor in August of that year. The only citation, which might have been good enough in 2007 but certainly isn\\'t very informative now, is \"Grousset, pg. 644.\" However, if you look in the original French version of Grousset, the quote is: \"Voici que les rois de France et de Navarre, prenant à coeur l’affaire de la Terre Sainte, décorés du signe de la croix, se préparent à attaquer l’ennemi de la croix. Vous nous avez écrit que vous aviez l’intention de vous joindre à votre beau-père (l’empereur grec Michel Paléologue) pour assister les Latins. Nous vous en rendons d’abondantes actions de grâces, mais nous ne pouvons pas vous faire savoir, avant de nous en être enquis auprès des souverains, quelle route les nôtres se proposent de suivre. Nous leur communiquerons votre conseil afin qu’ils puissent éclairer leurs délibérations, et nous instruirons Votre Magnificence, par un message sûr, de ce qui aura été résolu.\" This is in Grousset\\'s Histoire des croisades, vol. 3: La monarchie musulmane et l\\'anarchie franque (Paris, 1936), which hopefully you can see on Google Books pg. 649 (not 644). I\\'m pretty sure the Wikipedia editor simply translated it himself and there is no English translation of the book; there is an English translation of Grousset\\'s L\\'épopée des croisades (The Epic of the Crusades), but that\\'s a different book. Unfortunately the person who added the English quote quit Wikipedia in 2011, so I can\\'t ask him where he got it from. Grousset also doesn\\'t really say where the quote is from either, but the only place it could be is Les registres de Clément IV (1265-1268), which were published in 6 volumes by Édouard Jordan early in the 20th century. Most of the late 19th-century/early 20th-century publications of papal registers have been digitized, but not the ones for Clement IV, maybe because they\\'re still in copyright (the last volume was published in 1945 and Jordan died in 1946). Fortunately, I was able to guess at what some of the Latin text must be, and I found the letter at the IRHT\\'s \"APOSCRIPTA\" papal letter database Grousset summarized it a bit, bere\\'s the main chunk (the full letter is longer): \"Ecce reges Francie et Navarre cum multis comitibus, baronibus et militibus et aliis infinitis Terre sancte negotium assumentes crucis insigniti caractere contra crucis et fidei inimicos se viriliter preparant et potenter, iamque de regionibus aliis multi magni et parvi eorum provocantur exemplo, ut Christi nomen totis exaltent viribus et potentiam Sarracenorum, sectam etiam et nomen extinguant. Verum super hiis, que scripsisti, quod videlicet simul cum tuo socero adiuvare Latinos intendis, grates tibi referimus copiosas. Quo tamen nostri venire proponant itinere, rescribere tibi non possumus regibus inconsultis, sed eisdem significabimus tuum et soceri tui consilium, ut melius deliberare valeant, quid eis videatur agendum, et super hiis per certum nuntium tuam magnificentiam possimus reddere certiorem.\" So, we\\'ve got a Latin letter, translated into French by Grousset, and then translated again into English by a long-departed Wikipedia editor. But surprisingly the ultimate English version on Wikipedia is pretty good. Still, check out APOSCRIPTA for the full letter and many other resources...the problem there is they\\'re all in Latin, and not a lot of this stuff has been translated. I remember you asked a previous question about translated sources, and you were already aware of all the ones I mentioned! I think you\\'ve probably exhausted all the possible translated sources already.',\n",
       " \"Yes, very much so! I have a few pieces of writing on the general history of the duel which you can find here and I'll repost one of them below which provides a decent overview. To understand how a duel might be provoked requires first to understand what the underlying principle of the duel is - at least to the duelist. Namely, Honor. At its most basic, the duel was the resolution of an Affair of Honor, a situation in which one man felt that his honor had been impugned by another, and was standing up in defense of it. Honor though is a rather hard concept to define, and while there were broad ideas of when Honor was insulted, leading to a core of offenses that were sure to spark a challenge from any self-respecting gentleman - to give ‘the lie direct’, to physically strike another, to insult a lady under the protection of a gentleman encompass some of the most assured offenses, but the culture of honor that supported the practice of dueling created something of a feedback loop, by which I mean, in a society where honor was to be prized above all else, men were in essence encouraged to go with a ‘better safe than sorry’ attitude about whether they had been insulted. This often resulted in to things. The first is that, even in cases where it was agreed a duel was not allowed - taking insult from the words or actions of someone in their official military or governmental duties - it was common for the challenged party to note that while they were under no obligation to accept the challenge, they did so anyways as they would not want to be thought a coward for hiding behind a ‘technicality’ such as that. One such example of this would be Henry Clay’s challenge to John Randolph for words he deemed insulting while Randolph was speaking in the US Senate. Randolph could have claimed Senatorial privilege, but assured Gen. Thomas S. Jesup, Clay’s second who delivered the challenge, that he would not stoop to “such a subterfuge” to avoid the fight. Similarly, the series of alleged duels fought by Cpt. Fournier and Cpt. Dupont, heavily fictionalized by Joseph Conrad and later Ridley Scott as “The Duellists”, started when Cpt. Dupont refused entry of Cpt. Fournier to a ball, which were Dupont’s explicit orders at the time. He nevertheless accepted the challenge and they are supposed to have fought a number of duels over the next 19 years. The second result of the cultivation of an exaggerated sense of honor in the ‘dueling class’ was that the absolute most trivial of sparks could often lead to a duel. The fear that they might risk not issuing a challenge where one would be appropriate meant that a man perceiving the slightest possibility of insult would instead send a challenge when a simple apology would no doubt have sufficed without injury to either party. Similarly, even in the case where the party deemed to have insulted the other might have been entirely unintentional and not even understand why it was taken as such, they would often prefer to accept the challenge than to risk the slimmest chance that they would err in apologizing. A common sentiment from many duelists was that they dueled because they were a coward and afraid to risk what might happen if they didn’t. The censure of society - and possible social death - was feared over the possibility of actual death. But I digress! Now the fun part! What sort of trivial insults are we talking about? Cpt. Fleetwood was out walking his dog and it got wet. It decided to shake itself off near two women, possibly getting some water on them. Mr. Brocksopp came to their noble defense over this grievous insult and challenged. Shots were exchanged without effect. Lt. Col. Montgomery took his dog for a walk in Hyde Park. It began to fight with another dog, leading the Lt. Col. to yell out “Whose dog is that? I will knock him down.” The dog belonged to Capt. MacNamara who responded “You must knock me down first!” Montgomery was killed in the exchange, and MacNamara found not guilty at court. Dr. Samuel Chopin and Dr. John Foster both worked at Charity Hospital in New Orleans, but loathed each other. They were in great disagreement over the treatment of a patient who had suffered a stabbing wound, alternatively changing the treatments he received against what the other had ordered, and soon came to blows over it. Separated, a formal duel was arranged. Dr. Chopin was killed and Dr. Foster treated the patient, who died soon after. Lt. Bailey and Mr. O’Callaghan were actually seconds to a pair of duelists, but became so at odds when coming to terms for their principals’ duel that they themselves dueled. Lt. Bailey was killed, and O’Callaghan served a brief sentence for manslaughter. A popular anecdote tells of a guardsman of Louis XVIII alleged to have fought three duels in one day. His first opponent had looked at him “askew”. The second had stared too hard at him. The third had walked past him without giving him a glance. All were deemed to be insulting by the prickly Frenchman! A.G. Roach and James Adams were good friend attending South Carolina College, but argued over who was first to take hold of a dish at the dining hall one day. Adams was killed in the ensuing duel, and Roach wounded. Roach reportedly fell into depression over what he had done and died of alcoholism a few years later. So hopefully that provides a fair ‘slice’ of what I mean when I talk about trivial. In all these cases, the insults were either minor or absurd. Not to say that plenty of duels were not fought over the most serious of matters, but this is only a small sampling of duels that don’t quite rise to that level. Of course, despite what I wrote about, about the cultivated state of excessive defense of ones’ honor, it should be noted that none of these duels, even in a culture where we accept that dueling is an integral part of elite society, ought to have happened. While the popular understanding of the duel concentrates on the insult and then the fight, in actuality, the duel, as I alluded to at the start, is only one phase of the larger ‘affair of honor’, and popular image misses much of the middle stages in the process. Upon an insult occurring, it was rare - not to mention generally improper except for a select set of extreme offenses - to proceed straight to the duel. The two principals would appoint seconds, men with whom they were willing to ‘entrust their honor’, and the seconds were empowered, and expected to attempt if not a reconciliation, terms on which the matter could be defused and both parties feel their honor intact without resorting to combat. Carefully worded apologies - often quite absurd in their formulation - could be exchanged and allow both men to believe their honor intact. It is hard to say for certain, as in the case where a duel was avoided the lack of a duel is often absent from the record, but it is generally agreed that many more affairs of honor ended before a duel came to pass than resulted in a meeting on the ‘field of honor’. And in the case where a duel was the culmination, many dueling experts would agree with the pronouncement of Gov. John L. Wilson who wrote in his “Code of Honor”, a popular dueling guide in the US, “that nine duels out of ten, if not ninety-nine out of a hundred, originate in the want of experience in the seconds.” “Eugene Onegin”, which you mention, serves as a decent illustration of this. Although fictional, Pushkin himself was an avowed duelist, and not only drew on his own experience and familiarity with the code of honor in his writings, but his own demise in a duel has often been noted for the echoes it carried with the fictional duel of his magnum opus. In the case of the fictional duel, it is fairly clear that Onegin himself does not desire to go through with the duel - when the exchange of fire comes about it is implied he attempted to shoot wide and only struck down Lensky by sheer accident - and the failure to stave off the duel over what Onegin knows he should not actually accept a challenge for rests in large part on a failure of the seconds, who rightly should have negotiated a peaceful settlement. The duel of course being fictional though, this failure is indicative of Pushkins cynicism. Despite his participation, the duel is an evil institution, and he sees the initiation of an affair of honor as generally something that can’t be stepped back. Once insult is taken, the duel, to Pushkin, is nearly inevitable. ⅓\",\n",
       " 'Regarding death toll, an overview by Purkait et al reaches the following conclusions: There were approximately 25 major famines during the British rule in India, spread all over the States and regions of India. The incidence of severe and repeated famine reached its numerically deadly peak during the late 18th and whole of 19thcenturies. Administrators of British India were bad enough to allow remarkable impact on the long term population growth of the country. Famines in India resulted in more than 60 million deaths over the course of the 18th-20th centuries, and only the Great Bengal famine of 1770 is estimated to have taken the lives of nearly 10 million people. However, 30-40 million Indians were the victims of famines in the latter half of the 20th century. (p. 62) The tweet you linked falls prey to a common confusion about British rule in India: specifically, the British Raj ruled only between 1858 and 1947. If we speak about British rule more generally, beginning in the mid 18th century with the consolidation of the British East India company over most of modern day India, we can tabulate a figure of roughly 60 million deaths during the period of British rule in India. However, the culpability of the British in each famine varies wildly, and most scholarship analyzing British rule as a catalyst of famine tends to focus on famines within the Raj period, specifically the Great Famine of 1876-78, 1896-1902 famine, and the Bengal famine of 1943. Notably, Purkait et al, when enumerating famines under British rule, identify \"British policies\" as catalysts only in these three instances. If we take this analysis at face value and rely on mortality estimates from Purkait et al, this produces a figure of 13.6-23.3 million famine deaths for which British rule bore partial responsibility. Before moving on, I\\'d like to note that Mike Davis attempted a similar tabulation in Late Victorian Holocausts, and his summation of various academic mortality estimates suggests 12.2-29.3 million deaths for the 1876-9 and 1896-1902 famines (p. 7). It bears noting that his analysis excludes the Bengal Famine of 1943 altogether. So, if we accept the premise that the British bore responsibility for these famines, then they were indeed responsible for tens of millions of deaths, though not 80 million as the tweet claims. This brings us to the thornier aspect of the debate: to what extent did Britain bear responsibility for famines in colonial India? In the late 20th century, a number of revisionist historians began to revisit the role of the British colonial state in the famines of the 19th and 20th centuries. This analysis - initially popularized by BM Bhatia (see: Famines In India, 1963) and Nobel-prize-winning economist Amartya Sen - suggests that the undemocratic nature of British colonial rule, in conjunction with a push to commercialize Indian agriculture, exacerbated famines caused by natural factors. As Amartya Sen and Mike Davis have detailed, the British Raj in the late 19th century sought to totally upend the Indian agricultural system, pushing away from traditional subsistence-based modes of production and towards a more commercialized model with an emphasis on exports and cash crops. An article by A.C. Sahu examines how British-mandated grain exports played a major role in instigating both the 1876-9 and 1896-1902 famines. The export of grain became so problematic that prominent British Indian officials began a temporary moratorium on grain exports in 1866, though British officals rebuked them: In spite of the severe famine in North-Western Provinces Raja- putana and Punjab in 1868-69, the export had gone up to 752,560 tons. ... Even officials at the helm of affairs did not appreciate such large- scale export of rice. The Lieutenant Governor of Bengal C. Beadon in a minute dated 28 November 1866 observed that it was an actual and undeniable fact that while thousands of poor people in Bengal and Orissa had starved during the last few months, hundreds of thousands of mounds had been exported at a profit to foreign countries. ... When the Government of India turned down his proposal to stop the export of rice from Bengal, which was in the grip of a terrible famine, Campbell noted : \"I have no doubt that in any other country, than a British-governed country, it would have been done\". He further added : \"Lord Northbrook, bred in the strictest sect of English free-traders, looked on my proposal as a sort of abominable heresy\". (Sahu, p. 811). This becomes a common theme when analyzing British response to famine during the period. When Sir Richard Temple, the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal, successfully averted a nascent famine in Bihar in 1874 through the mass import of rice from Burma, British officials admonished him for associated costs. Hall-Matthews highlights how Temple subsequently revised his famine response models to prioritize low expenditure, producing woefully inadequate responses to the 1876 famine: In January 1877, after 2 weeks inspecting relief works in Madras, Temple provoked the biggest controversy of the famine campaign by suggesting that the governments of Madras and Bombay should experiment with a reduced relief wage, which for men was sufficient to purchase 1 pound of grain per day. The argument that they should be granted the smallest amount possible for survival was justified by the supposition that offering over-generous wages would \\'demoralise\\', and reduce people\\'s inclination to industry, a theory which he himself had scoffed at in 1874 and was to reject again after returning to England.\\'2 His greater aim was to look for ways of saving the state\\'s money, remarking in Gladstonian fashion that it would be unjust to the public interest to exceed the minimum need. (Hall-Matthews, p. 1193) Certain scholars - notably Tirthankar Roy - have sought to attribute the lackluster British response to the 1876 famine to a lack of necessary infrastructure, but analysis of the primary source documents reveals that, whatever impediment infrastructure may have posed, British officials simply did not care enough to implement effective policies to circumvent famine. This owed both in part to profit motives (namely, continued export of grains and cultivation of cash crops) as well as the prevalence of Malthusian ideology among the British elite, as outlined by Mike Davis.

       " \"Well happily, questions similar to yours have been asked before, see: Were famines in India a form of genocide ? this answer specifically discusses Mike Davis and the comment linked in question is very similar to the tweet you posted. How many died in because of the British in India? by u/davepx More recently see u/lordneobic 's wonderful answer to the question Did the American Civil War technically lead to The British starving people in India? It's worth quoting parts of his answer: According to an Indian government report on the 1866 famine suggests an average of 15 million acres of dry land and a further 5 and a half million acres of irrigated land were used to grow food from 1861 to 1866 which was enough to provide a food surplus for most of these years, including the period of greatest cotton production. So why did it suffer a famine? Drought. Drought was a common problem in India. Much of India relied on the monsoons for water, and if they failed, or were inconsistent famine would follow. This was a problem that governments through all of Indian history had to contend with, and the British were no exception. The British had made great strides in their famine response since the Great Bengal Famine in the 1770s but the limits of transportation and budget made any famine deadly. But famine in this period was caused by crop failure, not British demands for a certain crop. Not directly related but illuminating nonetheless, see this wonderful conversation involving the legendary Zhukov: Has India since it gained it's independence suffered from famine?\",\n",
       " 'There are some parts of this that fit with the literature on industrialisation, and some parts that don\\'t. Allen\\'s factor prices argument for industrialisation suggests that the development and application of labour-saving technology is a matter of relative factor prices, as you suggest. Expensive labour (relative to the price of capital) incentivises substitution. That part is probably correct, though it is damnably difficult to isolate that effect from everything else going on simultaneously. The quality of our wage data is not great, and the builders \"day wage\" series that Allen uses has been subjected to some serious critique. But I think the overall argument holds, that at least one reason for British precocity was a combination of relatively high wages and relatively low cost of capital. Countries that roughly fit this pattern tend to industrialise faster than countries that don\\'t. China, as you say, did not begin to industrialize until the early 20th century, and even then, only in the most developed, highest wage areas. Are British high wages a result of a labour shortage caused by mass migration? No. How do we know? Two reasons. 1) Because the vast majority of UK outwards migration occurred in the mid-19th century, after the beginning of industrialisation, not in the 18th century. 2) Because rapid population growth was increasing rather than decreasing the overall supply of workers. Migration before the defeat of Napoleon was relatively modest. Costs of transport were high, and incomes were low. This meant that accumulating the savings necessary to purchase passage to the new world and sustain oneself while finding employment was difficult. For relatively poor people, the usual solution was indenture. This solved both of the above problems, but came at the steep cost of one\\'s freedom for the years of the contract. Even as late as the 1820s, only 15,000 or so people voluntarily migrated per year from all of Europe to the Americas. African slaves brought across the Atlantic outnumbered free migrants by about three to one. This is simply not a large enough movement of workers to put serious upwards pressure on wages, though it no doubt had some small effect. The real mass migration of workers begins in the 1840s with the decline in the cost of transportation and the slow increase in wages. But by this point, the first industrial revolution was almost complete. Insofar as there is a relationship for Britain between wages and migration, it mostly goes the other way around: higher wages allowed potential British migrants to overcome the cost of migration earlier than migrants from other countries. Wages were high in the UK because productivity was high. By the late 18th century, Britain was one of the most urban, least agricultural societies in the world. British workers, especially in the North, were relatively healthy, well-fed, and skilled, at least according to Kelly, O\\'Grada and Mokyr. Canals, coastal shipping and road building had integrated markets and created large domestic markets for artisanal manufactured goods. Coal was increasingly used as a replacement for wood for heating. Agricultural innovation both mechanical and biological had increased land productivity, requiring fewer workers to sustain cities. International trade, including but not limited to colonial trade, brought in revenue that sustained merchants, shipbuilders, bureaucrats, and other producers of urban goods and services. The beginnings of banking and financial services allowed for more efficient commerce, as well as private and sovereign borrowing. The British mercantilist state could harness enormous revenues (by the standards of the time) to explore the world, to fight wars, to monopolise trade, all of which pushed wages upwards. Scientific societies were pushing back the boundaries of our understanding of physics and chemistry. And so on and so forth. Population growth also does not stop in this period. Indeed, the population of the UK grows quite rapidly across the 18th century, from about 6.5 million to over 10.5 million in 1800. It would be strange to describe the result as a labour shortage, at least in the sense of \"the number of available labourers was declining, so wages rose.\" The correct version is more like \"wages continued to slowly rise, despite population increase.\"',\n",
       " \"When? At various points the Doge of Venice was selected via acclimation by mob, propped up by whatever clique of aristocrats were most powerful at the time, selected by special committee, and eventually chosen with a complex system of electors and ballots. All these various systems had their individual pros and cons. Importantly, pretty much all elections after about the thirteenth century were driven by the need to guarantee no faction or clique would be able to exert undue influence over the Doge's selection, and thus electors were comparatively less concerned with the Doge being particularly suited for the job (although the electors did invariably settle on electing Doges with long histories of public service).

       " 'Generally, no. Most traditional Ashkenazi food relies heavily and specifically on locally available ingredients- which explains why potatoes are such staples in many \"alte heim\" (old world) recipes despite their not being introduced to Ashkenazic Jewish communities til the 19th century. In addition, many of these foods were adapted/adopted from foods that were eaten in surrounding Christian communities. That said, as I note in this answer about latkes even when some recipes were changed to accommodate new ingredients (like potatoes for latkes), there are traces of the original custom predating classical image of the shtetl and spreading beyond the geographical area of the Ashkenazic community. But an even stronger example of this than latkes is cholent. Cholent is a traditional Ashkenazi Jewish dish, specifically served on Shabbat that has gone through a lot of permutations over time (about which more in a minute), the standard recipe for which, these days, popularly contains ingredients like meat, potatoes, beans, and barley. (I season mine with salt, sauteed onion, garlic, paprika, and a squirt of ketchup- but everyone has their own favorite combinations, adding in things like BBQ sauce, tomato sauce, a can of soda, honey, chili powder... People also may make it healthier/gluten free by replacing the barley with rice/quinoa and the potatoes with sweet potatoes, and vegetarian by removing the meat. Anyway, enough of the recipe book.) It often looks like brown sludge but if done right it tastes amazing, with its praises sung by no less than the poet Heinrich Heine, a Jew who converted to Christianity for the social boost, which didn\\'t stop him from eating cholent (called schalet in Germany) and writing a parodic poem praising it: Schalet, wondrous sparkle of the gods, Daughter of Elysium! That’s how Schiller’s Ode would have sounded, Had he ever tasted Schalet. . . . . . . . . . . Schalet is the true God’s Kosher Ambrosia. as well as the very food of heaven, which on Sinai God Himself instructed Moses in preparing It is a stew that begins cooking on Friday night before Shabbat begins, and then cooks/stays warm overnight until the next day at lunch. In settings in which people didn\\'t have the cooking facilities for overnight cooking, often the local town baker would leave the oven on over the weekend and families would keep their cholents in the oven to be picked up after synagogue on Shabbat morning (my grandfather used to remember, as the youngest child in his family, having the job of picking up the cholent, which was very hot and way too big for him to carry!). The task of making cholent became a lot easier when Irving Naxon, remembering his mother\\'s stories of cholent being cooked in communal ovens in Lithuania, came up with an idea to make overnight cooking easier and invented a device that, after he sold the idea to Rival, became the Crockpot, which is now a staple in Jewish cholent-making homes (and many other homes besides for a whole host of purposes!). But the reason why I mention it here is that while it shares its potato-ness and relative lack of color with other traditional Ashkenazi foods (...hard to admit, but true), it is, in fact, only one branch off a much larger culinary tree. The concept behind cholent, after all, is based on religious requirements- the laws of observing the Sabbath do not allow any cooking to be done on that day. However, part of oneg Shabbat (enjoying the Sabbath) is seen as eating hot foods rather than merely eating cold leftovers that can\\'t be warmed up- so the concept that would become, in Ashkenazic lands, cholent was created. At this point (Talmudic era), there doesn\\'t seem to have been a specific dish or recipe that we can trace back to, nor is there necessarily one that we can trace back to about 500 years after that, when Karaism (which rejected the Talmud and oral law and insisted on Biblical literalism) renounced the idea of eating pre-cooked and kept-warm food on Shabbat and, in response, Jews who affirmed Rabbinic Judasm and the oral law specifically kept eating food that was kept warm overnight. The late Jewish food historian Gil Marks traces what we now know as cholent to medieval Spain, where it contained eggs and cumin. The Ashkenazic version with beans and barley traveled from medieval Spain to Provence and then France, where it lost the cumin and adopted goose instead of lamb. (Marks considers the famous French dish cassoulet to have been a takeoff of this proto-cholent, and incidentally thinks the same of Boston baked beans centuries later- however there\\'s not a lot of historical proof that this is actually the case. On the other hand, the Hungarian non-kosher dish shalet does clearly descend from the Jewish cholent.) From France, proto-cholent moved to Germany and eastern Europe, where it acquired beans and, much later, potatoes. And so, while the etymology (and indeed the name) is shaky (it could be called cholent or shalet depending on where you lived), while the ingredients changed, the concept stayed the same and for the same purpose- so that hot food could be eaten on Shabbat despite cooking being forbidden. But at the same time, parallel evolutions were taking place. That proto-cholent in Spain was also popular in North Africa and elsewhere in the Jewish communities of the Islamic world, and kept developing until, in Spain, it became a known quantity to the Spanish Inquisition as they searched out conversos who were continuing to keep Jewish practices. Chamin (also called, variously, adafina, tefina, and schina) includes ingredients that were more common in the places where these Jews lived, such as, in North Africa, chickpeas, white beans, and fava beans, as well as various kinds of meat, with the eggs being a centerpiece. There were/are many regional variants of chamin as well, just as there were/are of cholent. In addition, other local Jewish variations on the same theme were and remain popular, such as the Iraqi Jewish Shabbat dish tebit, which is a slow-cooked chicken or chicken skin stuffed with rice, chicken and vegetables,',\n",
       " \"I watched the video (though only this video, not the rest of the series, because I only have so much time) and left a comment on it with several elements that are wrong/questionable, so if that's alright I'll edit it slightly for here. -Thursday is not Thor's holy day. The reason why it's called thursday is because, in Latin, the names of the week were connected with gods and Thursday was named after Jupiter. As they were both deities related to thunder, the Germanic peoples who conquered the Romans translated it to their own gods and then the custom spread eastwards as other Germanic peoples adopted the 7 week calendar model. There is no evidence that it was very specifically holy towards Thor. We also don't have much evidence for it being especially sacred to Jupiter either. It was just a name for the day, which had lost all holy meaning by the 19th century. -Regarding her point on travel: People travelled a fair bit in the past, including in winter, for example for Christmas. So it's not this sort of impossible endeavour like she makes it seem, especially since, if it was to visit family, a lot of people would live relatively close together in a community as opposed to the current situation where families might easily be spread out accross the country. The actual quote there is important as well: Hale's point is that people aren't travelling all over the country like in summer, but sitting at home with their family, or at least in close range of their family. That's a good time for a family holiday, especially when combined with all the food being in from the fall harvest. It doesn't point to anything pagan. -We have two sources describing an Alfblot (neither from England.) One describes it as happening in the secrecy of the home, with no outsiders allowed. The other one describes the slaughter of a bull over a mound where the elves were said to dwell. Neither involves a matriarch in any specific role. Neither bears any resemblance with current day thanksgiving, except maybe the family element. But then again, families getting together for a religious holiday is a thing in... well every religion in the world. So that doesn't point to anything either. While we're at it, there's no connection between the Alfblot and Thor/Donar. In fact we don't quite know when Thor's holy days were, if he had any (and this is where it's also important to point out that local traditions around pagan worship and gods would vary considerably, so you can't extrapolate from a few Scandinavian sources to England and then America) Finally, I'm not very well versed in the state of international scholarship on medieval Norwegian literature in the middle of the 19th century, but I doubt Sarah Hale was very well-versed in that subject either. So I doubt she was even aware of this ancient holiday. -She seems to make a big point that a holiday likes thanksgiving has to necessarily involve giving thanks to some god, but I don't see how that's at all necessary. -The hearth was a common place of importance in the 19th century household. It was the centre of the house, where the family would congregate at evening together. It was also the women's space, where she would sew and knit etc. For someone like Sarah Hale, who despite her writing career was still very insistent on men and women having traditional roles, with women important in the domestic sphere, it would be very natural to emphasise this aspect of a family holiday she wanted to launch. You might think this is at odds with the whole depiction of her as a proto-feminist, but it's important to remember that a lot of women in the 19th century saw their worth in their particularity: they shouldn't imitate men, because they weren't men, rather they should demand equality based on their natural skills, like taking care of the household and children. So basically, for Sarah to put the Hearth in the centre of this family holiday is not at all surprising for her. -Perhaps the references to Demeter and Ceres are explained elsewhere in the series, but I just want to point out that there is zero connection between these two deities and the various forms of Germanic paganism. -She does not seem to understand how pagan rituals work honestly. The god needs to actually be involved. You sing hymns, do dances, say prayers and invocations, burn or kill sacrifices, etc. That's not present in any part of thanksgiving. The animals are not killed in any ritualistic way (in fact most people don't kill their own animals), any prayers involved are usually christian, no pagan gods are invoked. The only thing even remotely close to pagan sacrifices is having a meal together with other people, which was often done with the meat afterwards in various pagan traditions. But hey, by that logic I'm having a pagan ritual anytime I go to a restaurant with my mom. Thanksgiving has none of the elements of an actual, pagan, religious ritual. If Sarah Hale had the intention to reintroduce a big pagan religious ritual, it's safe to say she botched it spectacularly. -Regarding the oak leaf thing: I'm not American but I asked my American friends. They don't know any oak leaf imagery that shows up for Thanksgiving. Perhaps it's a regional thing, but if it's such a small part of the holiday that several people who celebrated could not even know that there were oak leaves involved, that kind of weakens that connection. And also, since pretty much all the other connections with Thor or Jupiter are pretty much nonsense, I think it's safe to say that the isolated element of a particular leaf being common isn't exactly a smoking gun that proves the connection. Especially since oak leaves have the advantage of being pretty uniquely shaped, so they're good for decorations trying to mimick fall leaves. Okay, let's summarise. Thanksgiving has no elements that show it as a pagan ritual. The connection with Thor is pretty much non existent. It bears about as much similarity to an Alfsblot as an apple does to a porcupine. Now what's more likely: that this woman decided to try to introduce a completely bastardised, barely recognisable as such, ritual to pagan deities for what doesn't seem like any gain (especially because it fails to include any of the benefits that such a ritual might have given to the deities involved), or that Sarah Hale was an American nationalist, living in a time where the country was being torn apart by tensions over slavery, so she wanted to promote a nationwide holiday honouring a part of the nation's founding mythology?\",\n",
       " \"I have a comment where I touch on the Southern Question a bit here You may find some of that discussion interesting, though it is more social and economic history than cultural. I also have a post here where I talk about the difficulties of political union here Of course, there is more to be said on your question about cultural unification. I'm not an expert in Giuseppe Verdi or Risorgimental opera, but some recent scholarship -- most notably Alberto Banti's The Nation of the Risorgimento: Kinship, Sanctity, and Honour in the Origins of Unified Italy -- argues that Italian identity was less a cohesive series of ideas and more commonly manifested in common tropes and artifacts in many art forms which expressed nationalist ideas in opera, poetry and art. Banti calls these 'deep images' common cultural reference points that point to national identity in novel way. In popular poet Giovani Berchet's Matilde, the titular character has a nightmare that her father wishes to marry her off to an Austrian soldier, prompting her to plead with him to not mix the blood of the oppressed with the oppressor. In Verdi's opera Nabucco, the biblical king Nebuchadnezzar stands in as an allegory for Austrian brutality against the promised people (which are, again, allegorically the Jews but coded as Italian). There are such common artifacts of reference in many of these cultural works that give pre-unitary Italian nationalism a sense of both religious and moral importance which render themselves quite evidently in the language of nationalism itself. In poetry Italy may be represented by an oppressed maiden, but in the transcendent fantasy of nationalists the importance of la patria was just short of the divine. Of course, these ideas become much more complicated after Italy's difficult unification where the fitful tensions between liberals, Catholics and moderates rendered an Italian state which left Catholics largely outside of its operation in the latter half of the nineteenth century. As such, these shared cultural references for nationalists became less common as liberals eschewed the divine language of sainthood and family for the more mundane language of politics. As I go into in the other posts, Italy as an abstract idea before unification was much more cohesive than the Italy that united in 1861, and the Italian state struggled mightily to govern a nation that was, while united in a geographical sense, severely divided socially and politically.\",\n",
       " 'One of the challenges in the field of education history or the history of childhood is the weight of people\\'s lived experiences. For many topics in history, our exposure is second-hand, mostly through popular culture, literature, or other media. But childhood? Every adult was once a kid. Education and school? Most of us experienced formal education in one form or another so we think we understand the system and how it came to be. As such, when it comes to helping people think about the history of childhood or education, there\\'s a bit of a headwind. There are a number of consequences of this tension. One is that it\\'s fairly common for people to think high schools are based on factories because their high school experience felt impersonal or assembly-line-ish. (They\\'re not Another example happened in this thread and helps us understand why there are 200+ removed comments to your question. Dozens and dozens of people are chiming in with a single sentence to say, \"I wanted to be a marine biologist because I saw Free Willy\", or \"my parents were huge fans of the Costeaus\", or variations on \"my school had a big recycling program and we were taught about saving the ocean.\" In other words, a lot of well-intentioned people are seeking to answer your question by giving you what they think is the cause of the effect you and your partner observed. Alas, though, as you and u/yodatsracist noted, it\\'s not that straightforward. It\\'s possible there\\'s one perfect answer out there, but from an education history perspective, I can only offer some speculation based on history I\\'m aware of; if you ask on /r/sociology, they might offer different evidence and reach a different conclusion. Which is to say, my hunch, based on a few things I\\'ll provide more details on is that \"marine biologist\" became ubiquitous in the 1990s because it hit a sweet spot around jobs, gender, and young people\\'s interests. Note: I\\'m basing my answer on American education history. Canada has its own history and while there is some overlap, there are distinct differences. So, apologies, Canadians, if I overgeneralize. First, marine biologist is a job that people of all genders can do. The late 80s and early 90s saw the consequences of efforts by second-wave feminists and others related to gender equity in schools. Title IX passed in 1972 and while it mostly focused on sports, it helped spur conversations and work related to soft gender-segregation in public schools; things like boys taking shop, girls taking home economics, etc. Gender equity activists and feminists used the symbolism that the act provided to push for increased gender inclusivity in school-related curriculum and events, away from gender segregation. This included training guidance counselors and job coaches to move out of strict gender norms with regards to career counseling (more on that in a bit) but also, it influenced the titles children\\'s book publishers put out and those that librarians purchased. And sure enough, in the December 1992 edition of School Library Journal there\\'s a review of Florence McAlary and Judith Love Cohen\\'s children\\'s book, You Can Be a Woman Marine Biologist If the title strikes you as super-specific, it was. Marine biologist falls right in the middle of the job gender Venn: it\\'s a science but it\\'s animals. You have to be smart but you can still be compassionate. It doesn\\'t have as much baggage as \"doctor\", \"nurse\", or \"lawyer.\" Feminist-minded educators and librarians were pointing out imbalances related to gender in the maths and sciences as early as the 1970s; they raised concerns about how career options for girls were often framed as assistants or helpers or books suggested that some science and math careers were better suited to men. Books like McAlary and Cohen\\'s were about showing girls that their futures could be different than their mothers\\'. (This philosophy behind this is often summarized in a quote attributed to Marian Wright Edelman, \"you can\\'t be what you can\\'t see.\") Despite the efforts of feminists to expand girls\\' possible futures, there were still tensions around what adults thought (and think) a child is signaling when they share their future plans. (There\\'s been a fair amount of research around the lack of men in elementary education and part of that is related to gender coding. A teenage boy who wants to be a teacher? NBD. A teenage boy who says he wants to be a Kindergarten teacher? Record scratch.) \"Marine biologist\" skirts those tensions. Second, marine biologist sounds like a cool job. A related but different construct was that school was increasingly providing content that had once been thought to be purely something parents were responsible for. Sex education, which had once been taboo in schools, had moved into biology class and/or health class. Driver\\'s ed, etc. Without getting too far into the history of how that came to pass, we can summarize it by thinking of a blurring of the home/public school content line. A father may have thought his daughter was destined to be a housewife like his mother, but public educators - who were responsible for children of all genders - were moving with society towards the idea (if not the reality) that every future available to boys should be available to girls. But why careers? That is, why was the focus on what children did after they left school? Because of efforts like Goals 2000. Although passed in 1994, the groundwork around the law began in the 1980s with an increased focus on the gap between what employers expected from high school graduates and the skills high school graduates had when they left school. (To be sure, colleges had been complaining about high school graduates\\' skills since the 1700s. Employers had as well but Goals 2000 served to put a stake in the ground around the relationship between school and the workforce. This isn\\'t to say school before that wasn\\'t about preparing children for life after school, it very much was, but not in the modern jobs and career way and not in a consistent way. Some states had vocational education programs dating back to the beginning of their public education system, while others started adding them in the 1970s and 80s. Meanwhile, other states had strict gender-segregation related to career and vocational training for high schools.) Efforts like Goals 2000 including expanding things like career counseling and job coaching as economists were increasingly focused on the relationship between funding for schools and the economy at large. What this means in terms of your question is that while adults were routinely asking children, \"what do you want to be when you grow up?\" by the 1960s or so, but by the 1990s, schools were asking the question not to start a conversation, but because it mattered to policymakers and school administrators. (Note: Unlike say, German schools, Canadian and American schools do not track children in high school based on anticipated post-high school plans. If/when children participate in vocational education as part of their HS experiences, they and/or their parents opted-in.) So, let\\'s say someone asked you what you wanted to be and you weren\\'t sure, \"marine biologist\" is right there. Third, kids thought marine biologists were cool. In my first paragraph, I explained how librarians ordered books to expose students to more and different futures, but also they ordered books because kids asked about them. To a certain extend, \"marine biologists\" slots into the same space as slap bracelets and jelly shoes. It was a cool thing kids liked and then it wasn\\'t. For some, it may have been about a TV show (or a movie, or a series of books, a relative, Sea World marketing, etc.) Their parents may have been big fans of sea life themselves (as u/Kelpie-Cat describes here It has the appeal of being like a vet but underwater! It\\'s easier to say than zoologist and oceanographer but more adult sounding than fish doctor! Adults have done a great job teaching children to answer a particular set of questions (more on \"what\\'s your favorite color?\" here and for a whole bunch of adults in 2021, we remember a spell in the 1990s where our answer to the question about our future career was \"marine biologist.\" ____ Tyack & Hansot, Learning Together: A History of Coeducation in American Public schools, 1990.

       " 'Though it is not precisely on your topic, while you wait for one more exactly tailored to your interest, I think you may be interested in a long response by /u/Kelpie-Cat that covers rising interest in whales and the see through Jacques Cousteau, Flipper, recorded humpback whale songs, and the \"Save the Whales\" movement in a majestic three-part post which almost no one saw: Why are whales associated with cosmos so much? The only two things I\\'ll add to that is that I think it\\'s clear that: 1) I\\'m taking it for granted that whales (and dolphins) are at the core of the marine biology, but that is my subjective assessment. I don\\'t think it\\'s a coincidence that in the Seinfeld episode where George Constanza pretends to be a marine biologist (Season 5, Episode 14 \"The Marine Biologist\", original air date February 10, 1994), for example, culminates in the fraud George having to go and save a literal whale. 2) We can pretty definitively say that Free Willy is an effect and not cause of the interest in marine biology. If you track Google N-grams for Jascques Cousteau, save the whales, and marine biologist, in the general English corpus marine biologist has a local peak in 1973 (probably related in part to Jacques Cousteau) and then just continued to gain steam through the 1990s. However, if you look specifically in the English-language fiction corpus (which I would contend might better reflect the popular culture because it doesn\\'t include strictly scientific works), you see mentions of \"marine biologist\" have a local peak slightly earlier, around 1990-1991, before the May and August 1992 shooting dates and July 1993 release of Free Willy, and that the mentions decline through most of the 1990\\'s before having another peak in the early 2000\\'s. Note: how Google N-Grams work is that it collects track every usage of a word/phrase in the whole Google Books corpus, which is a significant portion of everything published in English, and then divide it by the total number of words that year. It does a pretty good job of tracking the word\\'s popularity. Google has separate corpora for English, British English, American English, English fiction, and several other languages. Edit: A couple people have commented and pointed out other cultural texts, most notably Star Trek IV: the Voyage Home from 1986 (about time traveling to save the whales) and Discovery Channel’s initiation of “Shark Week”in 1988, as well as its other marine biology documentaries. I think both again are simultaneously products of and perpetuators of the dynamics that started earlier, back in the 60\\'s and 70\\'s, which /u/Kelpie-Cat covered well. In the case of Star Trek IV, they’re obviously literally traveling back in time to save the whales, an obvious reflection of the aims and worries “Save the Whales” movement which they documented. Likewise, Shark Week was apparently originally \"heavily devoted to conservation efforts and correcting the kinds of misconceptions about sharks that Jaws helped to spread. It was at the time one of a number of “stunt weeks” on the Discovery Channel. There was also a “Space Week”, for instance, among others. Apparently in part because of its resonance with these larger cultural trends (and I’d wager in part because of the unique take on these trends: sharks rather than whales and dolphins, an implicitly male focus, and also obviously drawing on/in conversation with the legacy of Jaws), Shark Week was the one the etched itself in the cultural brain. For the start, it was a success, apparently doubling the typical prime time ratings for the channel Though /u/Kelpie-Cat briefly mentions him, I recommend the NPR podcast Invisibilia\\'s segment on Roger Payne for a little bit more on the origin of recordings of humpback whale songs, and how they played directly into conservation efforts and the Save the Whales movement: \"Two Heartbeats a Minute (I believe this is the podcast I\\'ve been thinking of—the description is frustratingly vague and there\\'s no transcript.)',\n",

       " \"You know, there's a beautiful Spanish song which the Chilean folklorist Rolando Alarcón did a cover He, as a communist militant and supporter of the Unidad Popular and Salvador Allende, made a whole disc with covers of songs from the Spanish Civil War era. I comment this as a little introduction, because if the Spanish Civil War was important for the Chilean left around 1969-1973 (and I'd argue from way before), certain characteristics of the Francoist ideology and regime were deeply debated for decades by the national-conservative intellectuality and -lastly- introduced to the Chilean cultural and legal panorama by the Civic-Military Regime of Pinochet. I base my answer on the works of Isabel Jara Hinojosa, De Franco a Pinochet: El proyecto cultural franquista en Chile 1936-1980, , and Carlos Huneeus, El régimen de Pinochet . But I'll take mainly the first once since it goes deeply into the matter of the francoist influence on the regime. As I previously stated, the national-conservative Chilean intellectuality of the first half of the XX Century was really interested on the values promoted by the Francoist foreign policy through its cultural approach: The Instituto de Cultura Hispánica (ICH) began to work in Latin America (and specifically in Chile) since 1946, opening its door to promote the sense of Hispanidad, as understood like the group of philosophical and cultural values (like its religious dogmatism, the heroic mythology, aristocratic nostalgia, nationalist exaltation) and fascist thoughts (like anticommunism, antiliberalism and corporatism) that the Francoist regime mixed. Now, Isabel Jara goes into more details on what happened before the dictatorship, but to summarize what happened before: Even though renown names in the national-conservative Chilean academia (like Jaime Eyzaguirre and Osvaldo Lira) joined the ICH and even created a Chilean private institution to help the efforts of the ICH's political agenda, the reality clashed since Chile had a plural political landscape, and it wasn't well seen to support Franco by some parts of the society. Nonetheless, they began to adapt the Francoist Hispanidad to the Chilean landscape from their intellectual jobs (as historians, philosophers and universitary teachers). As stated by both authors, it's in this period in which the -then- student of Law Jaime Guzmán (main ideologist of the Pinochet dictatorship) studied and took these ideals from both Eyzaguirre and Lira (Guzmán was their student in the Universidad Católica). Returning to 1973 and the beginning of the dictatorship, Carlos Huneeus comments that Pinochet saw on Franco an example to follow: Mainly the anticommunism of spanish dictatorship and the longevity of its reign. His regime suppressed think tanks, study centres and most of the cultural and intellectual panorama that existed in Chile at the time, but his support to Franco created a revival of the ICH and it's Chilean circle which began to have way more activity than before, as states Jara, at the point that they reached its influence into the educational program of the Chilean Ministry of Education (they already did it partially and to partially public school through donations, but their influence grew up from now on). Not only that, days after the military coup, Jaime Guzmán (who was a really big opposition leader against Salvador Allende) became part of the Comisión Ortúzar, the commission that the dictatorship created to write a new Constitution for Chile. There, Guzmán took the thesis of Osvaldo Lira (influenced by the francoist ideals) in which it was proposed that what legitimize the nation and its rulers are the tradition and not the popular will. In this sense, Guzmán and the other intellectuals of the Commission, inspired on the Francoist regime but also aware of the dismantlement of the Spanish dictatorship after the decease of Francisco Franco, began to create ways in which the new pillars of Chile could continue for decades after the Armed Forces would leave the power and the political parties would return to the legality. Returning to the ideals, the Military Junta identified in the Francoist influences ways to justify the existence and longevity of the regime as Jara states. In their Declaration of Principles of 1974, they identified themselves as the defenders of the national Catholic roots against the Marxism, hence they were the saviours of the country. As both authors point out, the dictatorship identified itself as Economically (Neo) Liberal and Conservative in its values. Interestingly enough, this definition began a heated debate inside the collaborators of the regime: The traditionalist influenced by the fascist ideals were unhappy that the corporatism ideals weren't taken into account outside of the moralist part and that Pinochet followed the path and advice created by the Chicago Boys neoliberal economists. Even with that fracture, Jara says that they still supported the regime and worked in the National Secretary of the Women and the National Secretary of the Youth. In both offices it was promoted that the traditional and authoritarian catholic family was the core of the new society, and rooted Christian and National values to the youth, this in order to create a new professional elite that was apolitical. Heading to the central figure of Pinochet, Huneeus comments that he felt identified with the Francoist regime through its Anticommunist roots and the longevity of Franco's regime (specifically the image of perpetuity of the regime). Talking about the funeral of Franco, Pinochet was one of the few Heads of State that attended it, but he couldn't participate in the assumption of Juan Carlos due to the rejection of most European Heads of State who threatened to not attend the ceremony if he participated. Most importantly, Huneeus makes a comparison between both regimes, stating that in both cases there's a central dictatorial figure associated to the regime (Franco stayed in power for 36 years and Pinochet for 17 years). The economical modernization of both countries happened under authoritarianism, being examples of Prussian modernization, a modernization that happens without public liberties nor the presence of the Rule of Law. Both countries also opened their economies to the market during the regimes. But they begin to differ precisely in the economical term, that's because the Spanish technocrats who opened the market in Spain were a heterogeneous group of different political affiliations (specially after the decease of Franco) that proposed different kinds of policies to surpass the economical stagnation, weren't united (even fought on their different projects), while the Chilean Chicago Boys identified themselves with the extreme neoliberalism, adhered politically and fully to the dictatorship and had no opposition to their economical plans, even less the existence of economical alternatives. Lastly, I would like to point out that there were other influences that the spanish dictatorship (and the other fascist regimes) gave to the Chilean one, but from what I have already studied and re-read for this response, these were the ones I could answer for. I haven't seen any related to the sharing of tactics in terms of suppresion. or other militaristic ways in which Franco could have collaborated directly with Pinochet. Nothing closer to what the Operation Cóndor did. But, there were some exiled nazis working for the Chilean regime, though, like Walter Rauff and Paul Schäfer. I hope this can help with your answer! I will edit some grammar mistakes soon. You can check some other answers I have given on the Pinochet's regime here Sources: Huneuus, Carlos . El Régimen de Pinochet. Jara, Isabel .

The North and South Lantau Obelisks mark the points where the lines marking British territorial waters meet the land. However, they do not mark a boundary over land running between them. That is not to say that the extension of British rule over the New Territories was uncontroversial, as is readily evident from the anti-British uprising by the rural communities in and around modern-day Yuen Long and Tai Po in 1899 known as the Six-Day War.

       " 'Good article on the subject: Erich Gruen - Augustus and the Making of the Principate in addition to the accounts of primary sources like Suetonius, Tacitus and Dio. In short: Augustus was in a very precarious situation. He was very concerned with keeping up the appearance that Rome was still a republic. Few people had forgotten that Augustus\\' position initially was because of Caesar making Augustus his heir in his will. Augustus enjoyed exceptional power, but it was conferred on him personally, he did not occupy a position that contained all his power. The position of emperor did not yet exist. It could not be transferred to anyone when he died. He could not just name an heir either, because that would be seen as \"acting kingly\", and romans hated kings. Augustus publicly denied any sort of title or privilege that would be \"too much\". He denied being called dominus (master/lord) and other such titles. He was princeps, which means \"the first one\", roughly. He was also primus inter pares, which means \"first among equals\". He was not the emperor of Rome, but the first citized of Rome. One can argue that was semantics, at least in hindsight, but it was very important semantics. He collected prestige and authority, but he was no dictator or king. He made sure not to make much public and dramatic use of his power. He portrayed himself as a man of the people, not a man above the people, like the later emperors. Even still, he constantly had to try to evade accusations that he was a monarch with plans for a dynasty. Still, Augustus had multiple close calls with death. He had some sort of stomach issue that made him very ill multiple times and bothered him, although he survived to his 70s. This made it clear that he had to make some sort of arrangements for his death. He knew that the chaos and civil war that followed the death of Caesar could easily be repeated. He had the power of multiple offices, divorced from the offices. This was a symbol of continuity and stability, but that would end with him unless he found some way to fix it. He could not designate a successor, but he could request a \"colleague\". And this is what he did. He took someone as a colleague, so that his extraordinary power would be associated with Augustus\\' extraordinary power. If he took a partner, and that partner made himself worthy of some of his own authority, there would be some continuity. So that when he died, it would be natural for his \"partner\" (in reality, his heir), continued on. The problem that Augustus had was that the partners he took in died. Marcellus, his nephew, died of illness. Agrippa, his long time partner and general, and the man he though would succeed him, died of illness. The other man Augustus turned to, was Tiberius (his step-son and eventually son-in-law), who of course became the 2nd emperor. Tiberius was not the favorite of Augustus, he was known as a cold and misanthropic man, but extremely effective and talented, both as a military commander and as a civic administrator. He earned much of authority Augustus had and continuity seemed assured. But at some point, the relationship between the two went bad. Tiberius withdrew from Rome and the public eye. There are many speculations as to why he did this, mostly to do with personal intrigue, but we will never know for sure. This threw a wrench in the plans of Augustus, since Tiberius seemingly had gone into retirement. He was forced to prematurely advance the careers of his teenage grandsons by Agrippa. Once his powers had run out, Tiberius sought permission to return to Rome as a private citizen as the grandsons, Gaius and Lucius, had come of age. Augustus denied his request, now that he had begun on the long road to make his grandsons deserve their powers, as Agrippa and Tiberius had done before them. But misfortune once again struck Augustus. Lucius and Gaius died within two years of eachother due to illness. So he again, now in his sixties, had to return his focus to Tiberius as his only option. He adopted him as his son, together with the last living son of Agrippa, Agrippa, probably to consolidate the power and prestige of Agrippa and Augustus to Tiberius. Tiberius, a proven candidate, had no difficulty reclaiming his power. Agrippa, however, was banished. Tiberius and Augustus became a public duo. Whatever their feelings for eachother might have been, they appeared like father and son in public. Tiberius kept proving himself, as a military man abroad and as an administrator in Rome. So, when Augustus eventually died, Tiberius had almost as much power as Augustus. Continuity was preserved. So, to answer your question: TL;DR: He was very innovative and smart in navigating the political minefield, so that he could have a successor, without formally having a successor. But ancient life expectancy made it so that the candidates died, and the one who didn\\'t proved to be somewhat unreliable, even though he succeeded in the end.',\n",

       " 'John Francis Gemelli Careri was partially right. Wheeled carriages were allowed, but they were taxed. To evade the tax, sledges were used. In Dutch they were called \"sleepkoets\" or \"toeslede\". It was the actual body of a carriage but set on sledges. From 1736 all inhabitants of Amsterdam were allowed to drive around the city in carriages. This was allowed provided people drive slowly and orderly. However, there was a lot of traffic and very little regard for the rules, and big traffic jams started forming. The city council decided to tax carriage wheels. A carriage without wheels was not taxed, so starting around 1760 the first mentions of sledges are made. It was a pretty bumpy ride on sledges. Drivers would use a rag on a rope (a \\'smeerlap\\', still in use in Dutch language but now used to describe a filthy person) to grease the sledges. They would throw the rag in front of the sledge so that it would slide over the rag and get greased in the process, thereby making it easier to slide around the street. Drivers also had a special instrument made from wood by which they could push and pull the sledge to direct it. Drivers would never ride on the sledge but instead walk on the left side. In one of the images listed below you will see the house of a sledge boss. Sledge drivers were united in a guild, where both drivers of carriages and of cargo had to be registered. There were strict rules for sledge drivers. They had to be over 21, weren\\'t allowed to sit on their cart, and weren\\'t allowed to smoke. Even though the tax was charged until 1820, even at a later date sledges could still be seen on the streets, see below. Some pictorial examples: This etching shows wheels on a carriage: The street Nes, a print from 174, showing a sledge Nieuwmarkt 1764, showing wheels A painting from 1672 showing sledges: This is an actual sledge carriage, the oldest and the only known one in baroque style: A print from the Smithsonian: A very late example 1860 - 1870 The house of sledge boss Peter van Hoek showing an ornamental sledge stone: &#x200B; Fun fact: The sledge was also used in more tropical places, here\\'s a picture of a Dutch couple in Madeira: &#x200B; Sources: LIT.

       " 'There wasn\\'t really a \"going rate\", in great part because the purpose of a dowry was not to be a \"price\". In the early Middle Ages, it was common for husbands to pay a brideprice to his wife\\'s family, a much more direct transaction. The husband and father would negotiate the woman\\'s value, what the husband owed to her family for the right to take her into his. Around 1100, European aristocracy shifted to instead having the wife\\'s family settle a dowry on her instead, usually roughly the amount that she would have inherited if she had been single when her father died, which would become her dower (money/property she was entitled to inherit back when her husband died). This was interpreted by late twentieth century historians like Georges Duby as a decline in the position of women - in the brideprice/bridewealth system, they were valuable commodities that prospective husbands had to lay out substantial money/property for and people who would inherit some of their husband\\'s property after death, while a dowry was said to be a way to buy daughters out of the family property and prevent them from actually inheriting, protecting the family property for eldest sons - alongside a general silencing in politics and aristocratic business. However, this is a rather simplistic way of looking at women\\'s status, and in the early twenty-first century there has been pushback. In \"Women and Power through the Family Revisited\" in Gendering the Master Narrative: Women and Power in the Middle Ages , for instance, Jo Ann McNamara notes that after this point, aristocratic women continued to exert power in much the same way they always had, arranging marriages and conveyances, endowing abbeys, etc. We can also construe the dowry as a way to literally raise the value of women to their husbands and ensure that they retained a certain amount of property as widows. By the nineteenth century, this system was still in place for elite women. (Non-elites considered it outmoded and primitive, a form of buying and selling men and women.) However, rather than an actual gift of a dowry, women were more likely to have money and property settled on them at the time of their marriage as a promised inheritance, attached in the same legal document to the amount of money that they would inherit from their husbands when they were widowed, and the inheritances of their children. It was important for a family attempting to move up socially to put as much of their resources as possible into a daughter\\'s dowry. Joan Perkin, in Women and Marriage in Nineteenth-Century England , states that in the early nineteenth century, a very wealthy young lady from a trade family that was marrying into the nobility or a lady from the lower aristocracy marrying into the higher ranks would probably need to have £50,000-60,000 settled on her in order to make it worth the higher-ranking family\\'s while to take a wife with such a lower position in society. Equals, however, could make do with £10,000-30,000. From this, they would be promised 5-10% per year as an income when widowed. At lower levels of society, while people no longer referred to dowries per se, it was still frequently important for the woman to bring money to the marriage. Working-class women typically worked in factories or domestic service prior to marriage to save up some cash for setting up an establishment with her new husband (the need for which often prolonged engagements), and both working- and middle-class women prepared trousseaux in order to have household linens and goods once they moved away from home.',\n",
       " 'Good question! It\\'s perhaps the most popular FDR quote (matched only by the \"day that will live in infamy\", perhaps) and one that deserves a bit of analysis. It\\'s important, though, to set it in the context of both the paragraph that surrounds it and the overall aims of FDR\\'s first inaugural address. Here\\'s the entire opening paragraph: I am certain that my fellow Americans expect that on my induction into the Presidency I will address them with a candor and a decision which the present situation of our Nation impels. This is preeminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly. Nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today. This great Nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper. So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself--nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. emphasis mine In every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory. I am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical days. Franklin D. Roosevelt, First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1933 By the point Roosevelt comes to the presidency, the United States - and indeed almost the entire world - has suffered through more than three years of the most appalling economic catastrophe. The previous Hoover administration had largely attempted to deal with the Great Depression through \\'voluntarism\\' - the mobilisation of civil society groups (businesses, charities, churches, etc) to combat the mass deprivation of the era. It was quite late in his term that Hoover came round to the fact that there needed to be genuine federal action, and what he implemented was too weak and too late. The month after the Wall Street Crash, Herbert Hoover called business leaders to a crisis meeting in the Washington. In two weeks of daily sessions, he begged them not to lay off workers, to maintain wages, and assured them that the federal reserve would allow businesses to borrow money. It took business leaders only two months to go back on their agreement with Hoover. Lay-offs accelerated and wages declined. Voluntarism lacked enforcement. However, Hoover believed that the worst of the downturn was over, and when in mid-1930 a delegation arrived at the White House looking for the federal spending on public works, Hoover stated they were “sixty days too late, the depression is over”. Despite Hoover\\'s optimistic assessment, from November 1930 onwards it was clear that this was no ordinary downturn. Hoover began saying that this was a historic watershed, but still refused to consider the idea of concrete, wide-ranging federal action. To Hoover, federal unemployment insurance was not an option. It was - for Hoover - an affront to the individualist tradition, and private charity should pick up the slack. Which was all well and good, until one considers the escalating number of Hoovervilles (shanty towns) and homeless Americans as the days and months went by. Hoover did make one contribution that could possibly be considered a forerunner to the New Deal. In 1932, he created the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), that provided financial support to state and local governments, and made loans to banks, railroads, mortgage associations, and other businesses. The RFC wasn’t very effective – it had a slender budget – but it signalled the federal government’s willingness to engage in trying to stimulate a recovery, and a move away from the dominant laissez-faire doctrine of the 1920s. So, back to FDR and his speech! When FDR assumed the presidency, he did so when the economy was plummeting and the worldwide situation was increasingly volatile. Imagine: • Banks were shutting down every single day • Scores of farms were being foreclosed on every single day • 25% of Americans were unemployed, and the number is only increasing • Two months earlier, Adolf Hitler had become German Chancellor. Roosevelt’s first and most important task was to convince his fellow Americans that the future held better days – to restore confidence in people who were losing that belief. To do this, he offered two main things: comforting words and decisive action. The first of these is - as your question presupposes - best remembered by Roosevelt’s first inaugural address, when told Americans that “the only thing we have to fear, is fear itself.” He was in effect rallying the nation, as if a military commander. Roosevelt told them that the fear was “nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.” For FDR, there was no time for Americans to wallow in their own plight. The phrase told Americans that the only barrier to progress was timidity, that the real challenges to be faced were mental and that once the nettle had been grasped, the road to recovery would be open. FDR moved swiftly onto a bold programme of federal action that formed much of what is referred to as the First New Deal, and has been remembered as the ‘First Hundred Days’. The pragmatic, energetic nature of Roosevelt\\'s First Hundred Days, is perhaps best summed up by FDR\\'s observation that “It is common sense to take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something.” The New Deal more broadly is generally remembered for the \\'Three R’s\\' – Relief, Recovery, and Reform. The First New Deal mostly focused on recovery. A huge amount of legislation was passed – everything from banking reform to the repeal of Prohibition, to the Agriculture Adjustment Act (AAA), and the National Industry Recovery Act (NIRA). Overall, the First New Deal succeeded in renewing confidence in the country, and while the unemployment rate remained historically high, things had improved. While the Great Depression persisted, the feeling of intense crisis had passed by 1935, and Roosevelt and the New Dealers focused relief and reform in the US. When the Great Depression struck the United States in 1929, it shattered not only the economic prospects of ordinary Americans, but the belief they had in the future for themselves and their country. Roosevelt and the New Dealers’ importance was not that they were able to secure a full economic recovery – they weren’t and probably couldn\\'t – but that they were able to restore lost confidence and convince the nation that there were better days ahead. TL:DR? FDR was telling Americans that it was not the economic conditions they had to fear, but only their fear of taking decisive action. And he included his administration in this. FDR\\'s government would be bold, pragmatic, and decisive. It would not be bound by concerns about what might happen, only what could be done to implement relief, recovery, and reform. Hope this helps.

       " \"My answer focuses primarily on the United States. I imagine there’s similarities in other western countries such as the UK and France, but I won’t speculate regarding those. In the United States, it heavily traces back to World War One, and the huge wave of anti-german sentiment that swept across the nation. There’s a couple main points you can focus on: 1) Patriotism Prior to World War One, German was a very common spoken language in the US, particularly in areas such as the mid west where Germans had historically immigrated to in large numbers. In fact, it was estimated that approximately 25% of American school children learned German prior to World War One. However, when war broke out, there was a tremendous effort made at all levels of government to promote the war effort, and Germans were at the receiving end of those efforts. Schools across the country banned German (among other languages) because Germany was the enemy, and therefor learning German was unpatriotic. Erasing German language was just one part of this effort- perhaps you’ve heard of German food being renamed, such as sauerkraut becoming “liberty cabbage” or hamburgers becoming “liberty steak.” 2) Fear Because of the large German speaking population in the US, there was also a great fear in the US about Germany sending saboteurs and spies infiltrating the US government, which compelled various state and local governments to pass laws banning or curtailing the use of German, either in written or spoken form. For example, in 1918, William Harding, then governor of Illinois, banned speaking German in public, claiming that the 1st amendment didn’t protect your right to speak German in public. In addition, the federal government passed the Trading with the enemy act in 1917, which required German publications to include translations. 3) Propaganda This very closely ties together the first two points, but it’s worth noting, because they fit together in the overall attempt to create an “American identity” in the United States. In fact, former president Teddy Roosevelt gave a speech in which he condemned “hyphenated-Americanism,” arguing that you were either German, or American, not both. Because of these movements, and the fear of German sabotage, it became very easy to portray the German language as something to be combatted in the war effort. The effects of propaganda extended beyond just the war effort- Prohibitionists pointed to the large number of Germans in the brewing industry as proof that prohibition was patriotic, and were thereby able to ride that anti-German sentiment to achieve other political aims. After the war, things changed a little, but the damage had been done. German classes were often reinstated in schools following the war, but the numbers of students taking German never recovered. Part of that can be attributed to lingering xenophobia, though anti-German sentiment wasn’t as severe during World War Two. However, another angle to consider is simply that Germany had lost its international prestige. Prior to World War One, germany had been a STEM powerhouse. A huge percentage of Nobel awards in the natural and physical sciences awarded from 1900-1914 were awarded to Germans (I don’t have the book on hand, but you can find the details regarding that statement in “Hitler's Scientists: Science, War, and the Devil's Pact” by John Cornwell). Because Germany was such a center of scientific achievement, learning German was very beneficial. However, after World War One, germany was, to put it simply... not so prestigious. They had been blamed for the most devastating war yet known to man, had been constrained economically and militarily by the treaty of Versailles, and suffered through immense economic hardship in the years after the war and during the depression in the 30s. Obviously, none of those factors are conducive to scientific achievement or international prestige. In addition, it didn’t help that the Nazis took control and expelled many Jewish intellectuals, such as Albert Einstein, who had been on the forefront of German scientific achievement during the early years of the 20th century. Here’s a couple articles I referenced that go into some more detail regarding details and intricacies of anti-German policies in the United States during World War One. article 1 article 2\",\n",
       " \"Why exactly did British Elites support the position of the confederacy more so then the position of the Union? Certain politicians briefly consider helping the confederacy for a few reasons. Firstly there's cotton which was the main negotiating piece the confederacy used. Britain's textile industry was massive and of great importance to its national economy, the southern states prior to the war had been a major source of cotton for the textiles industry and the disruption of this supply chain by the union blockade made some suggest Britain should force the blockade to be opened. For the most part though British mills found other sources for their manufacturing. Additionally from a power politics perspective the united kingdom and the British empire at the time was one of the world's greatest powers and while the US was only just beginning to challenge Britain in terms of economics if not yet in terms of diplomatic influence or power projection capabilities some where beginning to think that Britain should consider acting to constrain the power of the US and that if the southern states could successfully secede that would provide a small counter balance to the US, perhaps preventing it from expanding south to invade and conquer Mexican territory and the like. At a smaller scale there was also the Trent affair. A British mail vessel took as passengers a pair of confederate negotiators who where trying to get across the Atlantic to get diplomatic recognition from European powers for the confederacy. A US naval vessel intercepted the vessel out beyond American waters and forced to to stop and be boarded and the envoys and their staff were taken as prisoners by the US navy. This at the time was illegal under international law and considered quite provocative by the British government that demanded an apology and the release of the envoys which the US agreed to. While American grain imports from the Union did play a role in the decision it would also have been unpopular with the vast majority of Britain's middle class that had a strong abolitionist streak over the last few decades and many pro-abolitionist news papers and the like particularly after the Emancipation Proclamation persuaded a lot of the British public that slavery was the key question the war was being fought over and as such Britain couldn't morally justify supporting the confederacy. In the end the British government provided the confederacy with very little. The government never threw its support in enough with the confederacy to actively decide to supply or recognise its independence as a result the majority of British guns that arrived in the confederacy did so as private purchase from british gun manufacturers largely to individual confederate officers and or states and the like. Revolvers was one of the more common items to be purchased, Beaumont–Adams revolver which saw use on both sides of the conflict, the Kerr revolver and the tranter revolver. American cavalrymen in general and particularly confederates liked revolvers which they tended to skirmish with a lot compared to cavalry elsewhere that still valued the more decisive impact of a charge with sabre and lance. While the Union was still able to produce many of their revolvers domestically (although they still occasionally purchased some elsewhere) the confederates didn't have the factories of the north and so they had to buy such revolvers abroad and smuggle them in. Similarly in an attempt to answer the unions use of springfield rifles they purchased some copies of the enfield which was a similar British rifled musket (Both were derived from the French Minié rifle). Another in smaller quantities the Whitworth rifle, a marksman's rifle of famously high quality the confederates used for picking off officers and artillery crews.\",\n",
       " 'Greetings! This is a most interesting question, and it is one which historians for decades have been trying to debate and come to some sort of half-formed, acceptable consensus on. I doubt there will ever be an end to this historiographical debate, but I can at least try to help shed some light on why the Treaty of Versailles ended up blaming the Germany Empire as the instigator of the First World War. For some more reading however, you might find this thread on the Treaty of Versailles being \"overkill\" as a helpful starter to what I\\'m about to discuss. Let\\'s begin. The Flawed Peace Parts adapted from the response linked above \"We came to Paris confident that the new world order was about to be established; we left it convinced the new order had fouled the old…We arrived determined that a peace of justice and wisdom should be negotiated: we left it conscious that the treaties imposed were neither just nor wise…It is impossible to read German criticism without deriving the impression that the Paris peace Conference was guilty of disguising an imperialist peace under the surface of Wilsonism\"^ - Harold Nicholson, a British delegate at the Paris Peace Conference. The German question was always an important consideration for the Entente Powers at the Paris Peace Conference. They could not agree on how best to deal with the German Empire, to ensure that Europe would never face such a devastating conflict again. Below is a primary excerpt from British Prime Minister David Llyod George while the conference was ongoing regarding his assessment of the French aims for revenge (or more accurately, his fears about an overly harsh peace settlement): \"You may strip Germany of her colonies, reduce her armaments to a mere police force and her navy to that of a fifth rate power; all the same in the end. If she feels that she has been unjustly treated in the peace of 1919 she will find means of exacting retribution from her conquerors... If we are wise, we shall offer to Germany a peace, which, while just, will be preferable for all sensible men to the alternative of Bolshevism.\"^ Clearly, Llyod George feared (given the Bolshevik Revolution which had neutralised Britain\\'s Russian ally in 1917), that any overly harsh Treaty which favoured the French would lead to another Bolshevik revolution in Europe, which might in turn inspire revolt across the Empire. French PM Georges Clemenceau for his part, was aware of this fear, but also believed that American President Woodrow Wilson and Llyod George were being a tad overcautious with their stances: \"We cannot take unfair advantage of our victory; we must deal tolerably with peoples for fear of provoking a surge of national feeling…Mr Lloyd George has excessive fears of possible German resistance and refusal to sign the treaty…They will dispute on every point, they will threaten to refuse to sign…they will contest or refuse everything that can be refused…President Wilson warns us against giving the German’s a sense of injustice.\"^ All three however, were aware that for Germany to bear the burden of any restrictions imposed by the Entente (and perhaps to justify such measures), they needed to emphasise the Germans as the key instigators of the conflict. Hence we have that notoriously named \"Article 231\" in the final Treaty of Versailles, otherwise known as the \"War Guilt Clause\": \"The Allied and Associated Governments affirm and Germany accepts the responsibility of Germany and her allies for causing all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies.\"^ When the German delegation arrived to sign and read over the Treaty, one of their first complaints was this clause, for they knew it would spell disaster at home. On May 13th, 1919 the delegation protested against the \"War Guilt Clause\"; the text of this protest actually reads: \"The German people did not will the war and would not have undertaken a war of aggression. They have always remained convinced that this war was for them a defensive war... They cannot consider the former German Government as the party which was solely or chiefly to blame for the war.\"^ In response, Clemenceau responded to this protest by bringing up a note from November 1918 sent by the previous German government to US Secretary of State Robert Lansing, in which Germany admitted that she was indebted to make reparations on account of \"Germany\\'s aggression by land, sea, and air.\" In the view of the Entente Powers (and France primarily), this was more than enough proof for German responsibility. Ignoring for even a moment the physical scars that had been wreaked on the French landscape, industry, populace, the atrocities in Belgium, and the German escalation of war in 1914, the Entente powers were of the opinion that Germany alone had to answer for expanding what could have just been the \"Third Balkan Crisis\" into the \"Great War\". Historiographically of course, assigning all of the blame to Germany is no longer the mainstream opinion (as it was immediately after the war in historical journals and circles). In the 1980s, the debate on the First World War came to a consensus (if a more general one) that while Germany was not solely responsible for the outbreak of continental war, it certainly had a greater share of responsibility than the other powers. More importantly however, we should note that German reception of Article 231 generated the \"war blame myth\". Here\\'s historian Sally Marks on the matter: \"The question of responsibility was assigned to another commission and not addressed directly in the treaty.\" In Article 231, Allied concern was purely financial, and there is no mention of war guilt, unilateral or otherwise. On the principle of collective financial responsibility, the same clause, mutatis mutandis altered but in essence the same, appeared in the Austrian and Hungarian treaties, but neither state viewed it as a war guilt clause. Germany, however, expected such a clause and so seized on Article 231, misinterpreting and mistranslating it and thereby linking reparations to \"war guilt.\"^ So whilst the \"blame\" for the First World War may have been a German invention at an ambiguously worded Article, it certainly was not a baseless accusation all things considered. Hope this response helps shed some light on the matter, and feel free to ask any follow-ups as well!',\n",
       " 'The actual war did not start with Franz Ferdinand\\'s assassination. That was a terror incident that was committed within the borders of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Any culpability of the Serbian government in the incident remains a point of dispute. The war properly started when Austria-Hungary declared war on the Kingdom of Serbia in response to the assassination, despite scant evidence that the Serbian government had any real culpability for the terror incident. Before the declaration of war, Austria-Hungary had infamously been given a so-called \"blank check\" by Kaiser Wilhelm of Imperial Germany -- an unconditional promise that Germany would support any Austro-Hungarian endeavours to punish Serbia for the assassination. This considerably emboldened Austria-Hungary and pushed the Empire to declare war upon the Kingdom of Serbia despite knowing that this would certainly lead to war with Serbia\\'s ally, Russia. Germany had given this \"blank check\" to Austria-Hungary despite knowing -- and indeed, expecting -- that it would lead to war against both Russia and Russia\\'s strategic partner, France. Germany proceeded to pre-emptively declare war upon both Russia and France on the 3th and 4th of August 1914. With the war declarations and the preceding blank check, Germany bore arguably the principal responsibility for letting the Archduke\\'s assassination spiral into a war involving four of Europe\\'s strongest militaries. But it doesn\\'t end there. Before declaring war upon France, Germany also declared war on neutral Belgium in order to execute the \"Schlieffen Plan\", an invasion of France through France\\'s undefended border with Belgium. In doing so, Germany violated an old pledge with the United Kingdom to respect Belgium\\'s neutrality, and in effect ensured that Britain, the world\\'s greatest naval power and largest colonial empire, would enter the war in Belgium\\'s defense. German officials evidently hoped against all logic that Britain would simply stand idly by -- after learning that Britain had declared war on Germany because of the invasion of Belgium on the 4th of August, German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg reportedly remarked that he was astounded that Britain should go to war over a mere \"scrap of paper\". Lastly, Germany\\'s tactic of unrestricted submarine warfare, as well as the infamous Zimmermann Telegram (one of the most spectacular diplomatic blunders in world history) served to provoke the eventual entry of the United States into the war in 1917. In short, while Germany hardly bore sole responsibility for World War I, its responsibility was still significant, and arguably far greater than that of any other single country. The idea that Germany was somehow guiltless, or that all the great powers were equally to blame, is a revisionist fabrication that arguably was bolstered by appeasement politics and straight-up Nazi propaganda in the interwar years.',\n",
       " \"To answer this, it is important to understand that what we call a 'phalanx' was a group of guys with large shields and spears standing in close formation for protection. This was not unique to the Greeks, but was used throughout the ancient Near East. The Assyrians were one such example: The sarissa phalanx was just an evolution of this, with the infantry still in close order, just using smaller shields and longer spears. So, if the phalanx was just guys with shields and spears in close formation, I think one can safely say it was used by many cultures after the Hellenistic period. The Strategikon of Maurice, which was composed in the 6th Century AD, listed the equipment of heavy infantry as including shields and lances. It also stated heavy infantry should be drawn up in the frontline, directly facing the enemy. Sounds pretty phalanxy, does it not? The Germanic peoples also practice similar tactics. This consisted of what is popularly known as the shield-wall. Those who made use of a such formation include the Anglo-Saxons, Vikings, Franks, and other such cultures into the medieval period. One artistic source for this is the tapestry depicting the Battle of Hastings: I hope that answers your question sufficiently.

       " \"You may find the answers to this question from last week helpful. The short answer is no. Thomas Jackson was a capable general. However, despite his mythical status, the real-life Thomas J. Jackson wasn't the most capable general of the war--or arguably even the most capable general under Lee's command. Jackson certainly was a gifted tactician, and won some notable victories, especially the 1862 Valley Campaign, when he skillfully utilized terrain, mobility, and aggressive tactics to evade and defeat a significantly larger Union force. However, it should be noted that during the Valley Campaign, Jackson was opposed by three Union generals who were incompetent, and who did not coordinate their actions, allowing Jackson to maintain the initiative throughout the campaign. If Jackson had been opposed by a more capable Union general, it is probable that he would have enjoyed less success. It is important to understand that despite his skill as a general, Jackson was not a superhuman genius. For example, during the Seven Days Battles, he made several costly errors. Throughout the Seven Days, he was sluggish and failed to take initiative, holding up the Confederate offensive and allowing the Union army to escape relatively unscathed. It has been argued that with Jackson's aggressive disposition, Lee might have won at Gettysburg. However, this is entirely a matter of speculation. Even if Jackson's presence could have turned the tide of any single battle, the Confederacy still suffered from all the weaknesses which ultimately led to its downfall: lack of manufacturing capacity, no navy, limited foreign support, the institution of slavery, political incohesiveness, etc.. Eliminating or reducing those weaknesses would have required a brilliant strategist. But Jackson wasn't a master strategist; he was only a skilled tactician.\",\n",

Fundamentals of the history of his development (pp. 143ff. and Friedrich Solmsen\\'s Aristotle\\'s system of the physical world (287-309) -- the classical Greek and Roman system had only four elements, not five. (And, incidentally, there is no evidence for a four-element system in ancient Babylonia as Wikipedia claims Let me just say that again, because it flies in the face of what an awful lot of people have claimed. There was no fifth element in ancient Greco-Roman thought. The reinterpretation of aether as a fifth element in Europe dates to the mediaeval period. I\\'m no expert on the development of the idea in that era, but it seems to be closely linked to people like Albertus Magnus in the 13th century. Their reading of Aristotle has had an awful lot of influence. The Greco-Roman system of four elements -- water, earth, fire, and mist (not air) -- was first imagined by a Sicilian, Empedocles, in the 400s BCE, and rationalised by Aristotle a century later. Aristotle\\'s actual contribution is poorly understood in popular treatments: he didn\\'t repeat Empedocles\\' four-element system, he tried to explain it. He doesn\\'t agree with it. He actually calls Empedocles self-contradictory at one point (On coming to be and passing away 315a Aristotle explains Empedocles\\' system as a set of four emergent properties, not fundamental elements. For Aristotle, the more fundamental idea was that there was just hylē (\\'stuff\\', \\'matter\\', \\'mass\\'), and this \\'stuff\\' produced the Empedoclean four depending on the presence or absence of two qualities -- heat (or cold), wet (or dry): &nbsp;|Cold|Hot :--|:--|:-- Dry|Earth|Fire Wet|Water|Aēr (\\'mist\\' or \\'lower air\\') The main source for this is Aristotle\\'s On coming to be and passing away, though it also comes into On the sky. Aristotle does talk about aether too, but as a term in common parlance, not as an element. In early Greek cosmology, including mythological sources like Homer, aether was a name used for the top layer of the cosmos, including the region where the sun and stars are, and sometimes also the tops of tall mountains; below that were aēr (\\'mist\\'), the surface of the earth, and below that Hades and then Tartarus. When Aristotle mentions aether, his meaning is different, because of the realisation that the earth is spherical. Homer\\'s aether was the top layer of the cosmos; with a spherical earth it had to become its outer shell instead. Aristotle thought of the aether as a region, not a substance. This combines with Empedocles\\' four elements as follows. Aristotle didn\\'t understand that gravity and buoyancy are different things, and this led him to regard the four Empedoclean qualities -- water, earth, fire, and mist -- as having natural positions, based on whether they are heavy (cold, wet) or light (hot, dry). So the heavy substances, earth and water, settled at the centre of the cosmos, while the light ones, mist and fire, settled on the outside, with fire as the lightest of the four. A passage describing one of Aristotle\\'s lost works makes it clear that he thought of the aether as fiery, not a fifth substance (Cicero, On the nature of the gods 2.41-42 Therefore, because the Fire of the sun is similar to those fires that exist in the bodies of animate creatures, it must be that the sun is also animate ... So since the origin of some creatures lies in Earth, others in Water, and others in Air, Aristotle thinks it absurd to imagine that no animal is generated in that element which is most suited to generating animate things. Cicero also refers to Aristotle talking about aether as a region, not an element -- the aetherium locum, \\'aetherial region\\'. Plato is also sometimes credited with the notion of five elements, and this is wrong too. Plato was no empiricist: he wasn\\'t interested in empirical properties, like Aristotle was. His effort comes from an attempt to harmonise Empedocles, the atomic theory of matter, and his own mathematical preoccupations. His idea, then (Timaeus 53c-56e was that Empedocles\\' four elements corresponded to four kinds of atom, and these four kinds of atom corresponded to four of the five \\'Platonic solids\\' -- Fire atoms are tetrahedrons, Earth atoms are cubes, Mist atoms are octahedrons, and Water atoms are icosahedrons. There was a fifth solid left over, the dodecahedron, and so he had to find something to do with it. He ended up deciding that it corresponded to the shape of the cosmos as a whole (Timaeus 55c; possibly because, out of the five solids, a dodecahedron is closest to a sphere in certain respects). Plato, too, used the word aether at some points; it\\'s a word in common parlance, remember. But he, too, didn\\'t think of it as a separate substance. Plato thought of aether as an especially thin variety of Mist, in the same way that flames, firelight, and glowing embers are all varieties of Fire (Timaeus 58c-d As I said earlier, I can\\'t give a full history of how Aristotle\\'s fiery aetherial region came to be reinterpreted as made of a separate element. But it\\'s pretty clear that it was partly because the heavens have a different kind of motion from all other observable matter. In Aristotle\\'s thought, all matter has a natural upward or downward motion depending on whether it\\'s light or heavy; and this motion can be linked to the Empedoclean elements (fire is light, earth is heavy). But the celestial sphere rotates. Aristotle explained the up-down motion of terrestrial things in terms of the Empedoclean substances. That didn\\'t work for the celestial motion, so he didn\\'t link the celestial motion to substances at all. Mediaeval writers did, though. Most were emphatic that the celestial sphere must be a fifth element. You can see an intermediate step in Bartolomeus Anglicus (De rerum proprietatibus 8.5, trans. E. Grant): The aether is something beyond the lunar globe that is of a separate nature from the nature of the inferior elements. Thus the aether is neither heavy nor light, neither rare nor dense, nor is it divisible by the penetration of another body. No corruption or alteration, universally or particularly, affects the aetherial nature, which would happen to it if its origin or composition were drawn from the elements. Contemporary thinkers were split on the matter. Johannes de Sacrobosco\\'s introduction to his On the sphere is emphatic: Around the elementary region revolves with continuous circular motion the ethereal, which is lucid and immune from all variation in its immutable essence. And it is called \"Fifth Essence\" by the philosophers. But Robert Grosseteste\\'s De generatione stellarum took the opposing view: A star, however, is not of the nature of a fifth element; nor is a star a single element, since if it were, the seven planets would constitute seven elements according to their nature, and that is not the case. I\\'m aware that both Grosseteste and Sacrobosco had access to materials translated from Arabic, so it may be that there is something in the Arabic literature on Aristotle that prompted a line of thought that linked the motion of the celestial sphere to its substance. Note: for my limited understanding of the elements in late mediaeval thought, I have relied on Edward Grant\\'s Planets, stars, and orbs: the mediaeval cosmos, 1200-1687 (Cambridge, 1996), especially pages 422-428. My account of Aristotle and Plato is a rewritten form of an online piece I wrote last year which has a few more details that I haven\\'t included here.',\n",

       " 'A little bit of background on this one: in 1583, John Dee and his scryer began the compilation of a series of 49 x 49 tables; this is MS Sloane 3189 or the \"Liber Loagaeth\" (Book of the Words of God). About 1584, they compiled a second book. It was from the latter that we eventually got A True and Faithful Relation of What Passed for Many Years Between Doctor John Dee and Some Spirits , and which eventually gave rise to the popular Enochian magical traditions. Some other scattered Enochian words in John Dee\\'s journals (preserved as MS in the British Library, including Quinti Libri MysteriorumMS. Sloane 3188) also survived and help to fill out the dictionary of Enochian. So, putting on our cryptography hats, a code is any system of transforming information into a different form. A cipher is a specific kind of encoding where the individual letters in a text are replaced with different letters or characters. In a simple substitution cipher, for example, you would substitute each letter with some other letter or combination of letters; so perhaps A with B, B with C and so forth. Under that kind of cipher \"Lamb\" would be \"Mbnc.\" Many constructed languages like to replace the existing English or Latin alphabet with different characters - so for example, Futurama\\'s first Alienese is just English with weird symbols in place of English letters. There are other transformations and tricks that can go into making a code, but that\\'s the essence of a cipher. We know that Dee was familiar with many kinds of codes and ciphers because he owned a copy of Johannes Trimethius\\' Steganographia (c. 1499) and Polygraphia . Many codes can be broken mathematically - the relationships between the letters has to remain intact for a cipher to be deciphered, so a canny mathematician can try to work out the transform. This does, however, require that there be some actual content to be decoded: if you take a nonsense word \"bldb\" and cipher it to \"cmec\" - the code works fine, but the content is still just nonsense. You wouldn\\'t know if you got it right or not, at least not without some context that made \"bldb\" make sense. As for what Enochian is...because this was all handwritten there are a few different scripts or variations of diacritics and suchlike involved, but the key elements are: - The \"Enochian alphabet\" has 22 characters which map largely to the Latin alphabet - Texts which have been written in Enochian, with a parallel translation into English - Texts which have been written in Enochian but with no English translation (mostly the tables of the Liber Loagaeth). The initial instinct of a lot of investigators was that Enochian was basically a simple substitution cipher for English, using a homemade alphabet like Alienese (in fact, the letters were such a pain that Dee asked if Roman characters could be used instead, and most of the Enochian bits are actually written in the English or Latin alphabet). However, if you proceed with trying to work out a substitution cipher with the parallel translations that Dee offers, that doesn\\'t work. To give an example from the book, where you can see the Enochian and English side-by-side the Enochian text reads like: Madriax Ds paf. Lil. Chis Micaolz. Sa a nir. Ca os go. Od fifis. Bal zi zras. Ta Ia - i da. Nonca. Go hu lim. And the supposed English translation: O you heavens which dwell In the first air are mighty in the parts of the earth and execute the judgment of the highest to you It is said However, while Dee\\'s Enochian is fairly consistent in terms of vocabulary (i.e. the Enochian \"od\" is always rendered as the English \"and\"), nobody has worked out a system of encipherment that goes consistently from those given Enochian terms to the English equivalents. So what he does not appear to have been doing is just writing the English language texts down and then translating them to Enochian using a cipher. However, if Dee\\'s translation is at all accurate, then that means that the language he\\'s translating from has grammar and syntax almost identical to his contemporary English - that brings us back around to the idea that the original language is either English, or Dee\\'s translation is taking much more substantial liberties (not unknown if the base language was, say, Hebrew). Efforts have been made to try substitution ciphers with various other known languages, but to no avail. If Dee and/or Kelley was using a code to generate Enochian, it was something sufficiently idiosyncratic or complex that nobody\\'s broken it...and the possibility remains, as mentioned above, that there might not be any plaintext at all; that Kelley and/or Dee just created the Liber Loagaeth out of whole cloth. So while you can scroll through his text and create a working \"dictionary\" of Enochian, you can\\'t really translate any terms that Dee didn\\'t provide a translation for. Which is kind of characteristic of a lot of relatively simple constructed languages: instead of coming up with complex grammar or spelling rules, or really funking ways to encode the language you\\'re familiar with, you just need a codebook or lexicon that contains words in both languages. You can see that kind of constructed language in Giak by Joe Dever for the Lone Wolf books for example. Which brings us back around to your original question: Has there any recent progress on deciphering Enochian? There\\'s been continual interest in John Dee, and not a little bit of his interest in cryptography, but I\\'m not aware of any recent developments with regarding to finding a code in Dee\\'s Enochian. There is some very interesting related scholarship, however. In 1583, Edward Kelley produced a forged document, in cipher, called the Northwick Scroll which he presented to Dee for decryption. You can read about that in \"Edward Kelley’s Danish treasure hoax and Elizabethan antiquarianism\" by Francis Young. This showcases both Kelley and Dee\\'s familiarity with cryptography.',\n",

       " 'I\\'m not sure why you think \"Alexander\" sounds wrong. That is indeed what his bodyguards and officers would have prided themselves in calling him. Both \"chief\" and \"my king\" are completely unhistorical and wildly out of place for the setting. Macedonian kings held a hereditary position, but still had to be formally \"acclaimed\" by the Assembly, which consisted of all adult male Macedonians in arms. This meant that the Macedonian army was formally the kingmaker, and that the authority of a king like Alexander rested on the consent of his troops. One consequence of this unusual relationship between king and army was that Macedonian kings deliberately cultivated an approachable manner. They were known to dress simply, to eat and drink the same fare as the men, and to demand no special rituals or forms of address. To keep on the good side of the men who had risen them to the throne, they tried to profile themselves as \"one of the boys\". This went double for the bodyguards of the king. As a rule, these were members of the most powerful Macedonian noble families. Most of them had grown up together with the king in the Macedonian elite education system. Several of them may have been the king\\'s romantic or sexual partners. Upon reaching adulthood, these men served together continuously as close confidants and companions in battle. They would not only address the king by his name; they would be outraged if they were told to address him any other way. Alexander in fact got into trouble with his Macedonian soldiers for precisely this reason. Part of the struggle of his later reign was the need to unite two very different styles of kingship: the informal, first-among-equals Macedonian style, and the exalted, divinely-sanctioned Achaemenid Persian style. Over time, Alexander began to appropriate the customs of the Persian court in order to seem more kingly to his new subjects; this included the particular custom of proskynesis, or obeisance, which required those who approached the king to bow, kneel or even prostrate themselves before him. When the Macedonian officers learned of this, they lost their shit. To them, it was not only unacceptable and ridiculous but outright sacrilegious to treat a king with the kind of deference suited to gods (in Macedonian custom). They did not follow their king out of obligation to some exalted creature; they followed the man they could look in the eye and call Alexander. Non-Macedonians, especially those from the rest of the Persian Empire, would have been more likely to address him with \"O King\" - the notion of personal allegiance expressed with the genitive (\"my king\") is alien to the ancient world.',\n",

       " 'Most were interned and expelled. Robert A. Fearey, in a memoir (\"My Year with Ambassador Joseph C. Grew, 1941-1942: A Personal Account\", except here recounts how the embassy staff and a few businessmen who had taken refuge there were immediately interned on Dec 7, and spent a reasonably pleasant time stuck in the embassy compound, save for a few golf trips to Tokyo courses, until they were expelled June 17. On the transport ship they met a variety of other Americans also being expelled, some of whom had fared rather less well: The newsmen, who the Japanese assumed were all spies, had been held in closed confinement or prison, often in solitary, constantly interrogated and in many cases, tortured. (Later, on the ship, some of them demonstrated the “water cure” torture to which they had been subjected — some many times.) ... Our newsman, Max Hill of AP, who had spent almost his entire internment in solitary under torture, said that if we did not depart, he would commit suicide. He clearly meant it and in fact did commit suicide some years later, perhaps due in part to what he had suffered in confinement. ... U.S. Consul General Southard was one of the first to come on board. He had lost fifty-four pounds in confinement, and his clothes hung on him like sacks. Fearey estimates 700 repatriates were on his ship from Japan, another 250 from Taiwan and Saigon, and an unknown amount on another ship from Singapore. This was probably most of the American nationals in the country, with a few exceptions. Patrick James Byrne, a Catholic missionary, remained in Japan under house arrest rather than, well, actual arrest, due apparently to his reputation for charitable works. There were a handful of naturalized citizens of American origin. Gwen Harold Terasaki, wife of Japanese diplomat Hidenari Terasaki, wrote a book about her experience in this category, \"Bridge to the Sun\" (later also a movie.) She had no trouble with imprisonment, and while you may say that as the wife of a fairly high official her experience may not be representative, she was also one of the very few people in this position. Some 14,000 American civilians were captured in later stages of the war at Midway, Guam, Wake Island, the Philippines, merchant mariners, etc., and were mostly held as internees until the end of the war. These civilian internees were apparently treated somewhat better than military personnel; some 40% of POWs died while held, in contrast to 11% of civilians. (The numbers for those held by Germany were 1% and 3%, respectively.) I don\\'t have a cause breakdown, but it\\'s important to note that disease and transportation were much more dangerous in the Pacific, and a few specific events (like the sinking of prisoner transport ships and the \"Bataan Death March\") have an impact on those numbers besides the general treatment of the different classes of prisoner.',\n",
       " 'This is a question that people can write entire books on, but I’ll try to give an explanation. The overly simple answer to this question is: because the allies agreed to allow Germany to stay independent. This was decided at the Yalta conference in 1945, where Roosevelt, Stalin, and Churchill agreed that after the war, Germany would remain its own country. Now, for the more in depth answer: You have to start by looking at the aforementioned Yalta conference of 1945. The purpose of this conference was to determine what would be done with Germany after the war ended, which as it turned out, would be a few months later. Among the things agreed upon at the Yalta conference: 1. Purge Nazis from positions of power 2. Foster the growth of democracy 3. Remove the German military 4. The creation of four zones of occupation. Now, points 2-4 are most relevant to your question. However, keep in mind, that though Stalin, FDR, and Churchill all agreed to foster democracy, they all had very different conceptions of what democracy is. And, just to clarify, by zones of occupation I do not mean splitting germany into four separated states, just that the allies share the duties of occupation. These duties, which are later more formally agreed upon at the Potsdam conference in July-August of 1945, include the “Four Ds:” -Denazification -Deindustrialization -Demilitarization -Democratization Also important to note is that at the Potsdam agreement, the allies still believe in a unified Germany. East Germany as an independent state is not created until 1949. Now, to address your first part of the question, as to why the Soviet Union didn’t expand its territory: well, to some extent, they did. If you look of a map of Germany before 1939, you’ll see that Germany has two prong like bits where Poland is now, along the Baltic Sea. That territory was historically Prussian and home to large numbers of ethnic Germans. After the war, the USSR takes control of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad), which you can now see on a map of Russia as that little disjointed bit on the Baltic Sea coast. In addition, much of eastern Germany’s territory is lopped off and given to the polish, while Poland loses some of its eastern territory as well and essentially shifts west on the map. Also of note is that the borders of the soviet zone of occupation/East Germany were decided before the war ended as a compromise. Neither the soviets nor the Americans knew where exactly where they’d be at the end of the war, so they kind of had to hedge their bets geographically. In fact, the Americans were actually almost at Berlin when the war ended, but retreated west, back to the agreed upon demarcation line rather than set up their zone right where they were. As for why East germany didn’t just get absorbed into the Soviet Union, there’s several aspects to consider. Prior to 1949, Stalin does try to squeeze the allies. He blockades off West Berlin (which, as you may know, is also occupied four ways and happens to be squarely in he middle of the Soviet zone), hoping to get the allies to back down, but the Berlin airlift ruins his plans. Also, prior to 1949, Stalin does not have a nuclear weapon. This prevents him from trying to be more aggressive than and going back on his word from Yalta/Potsdam should he have wanted to do that. Once east Germany does become a state, the simplest reason is just that there’s no need to absorb East Germany into the USSR. East Germany was a sofort satellite state and part of the Warsaw Pact, along with the other countries behind the iron curtain, so they were allied militarily. In addition, East Germany’s General Secretary would generally do whatever was asked of him by Moscow. By carefully planting loyal communist officials in the East German government, the Soviet Union retained a large degree of control over east Germany while retaining the appearance of respecting sovereignty and democracy (which, as the uprisings in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 show us is largely baloney). Another factor is strategic: in the event of nuclear war and/or a land war with NATO, East Germany, along with the rest of the Warsaw Pact countries, provided a buffer zone for the Soviet Union. As for the other part of your question, “how was germany even able to remain a country?” Well, the answer is that many people thought that Germany should NOT have become a country again. This was most famously advocated for by Henry Morgenthau, who was FDRs secretary of the treasury. Morgenthau argued that Germany should be split into three zones, stripped of its military and heavy industry, and only be allowed to have the industrial capacity it had had in 1933. Of the three zones, the western zone, which is also where most of Germany’s industry is, would be an “international zone” governed by the UN. That plan was never formally adopted. Partially because the new Germanies wouldn’t be able to sustain themselves, but also because there was a fear that if the allies got too punitive, they would destroy the ability of Germany to recover and thereby encourage exactly what had happened after the treaty of Versailles. The western allies felt that economically integrating Germany into Europe would be the best way to ensure peace and stability in the future. In addition, with the start of the Cold War, the allies were deathly afraid of communism taking hold in Germany, and therefor pumped tons of money into Germany via the Marshall Plan, under the assumption that a prospering, economically sound Germany would be less susceptible to communism.',\n",
       " 'Greetings! This is an interesting question and I\\'ll answer it in a way which goes along with the narrative of a POV. Let\\'s assume for the conditions that it\\'s 1916 and you\\'re eager to actively fight in the First World War on the side of the Entente Powers (that is, Britain and France). Your first and probably most popular choice of route is none other than the famous Lafayette Flying Corps, an all-American volunteer squadron serving with the French Air Force which was authorised and deployed for frontline duty on April 20th, 1916. Though commanded by French officers (most notably Capt. Georges Thennault) and flying for the French Air Force, all of the pilots were of American origin. You would likely not be able to join the elite Escadrille Americaine (American Squadron, formally known as N 124), as that was formed of the first 38 volunteers with some prior experience flying aircraft (among those early volunteers was Raoul Lufbery, who would go on to be top-scoring ace in the war). You might however, get lucky and serve as a replacement for the escadrille incase their numbers started to dwindle, but this was also dependent on your fellow pilots and their skills. How would you join the squadron? Here\\'s the actual process: In America you would report your interest and flying credentials to Philip A. Carroll, American representative to the committee overseeing the Lafayette Flying Corps. You would then undergo a physical examination and an hour\\'s flying test at Mineola, New York. If you passed that stage, you would then be sent to France, where you would report to Dr. Edmund L. Gros (one of the first American fliers for France and founder of the American Hospital of Paris). After undergoing a second physical examination, you would sign your papers of enlistment. You would not be ordered to swear allegiance to the French Government, so you remained an American citizen. That\\'s the first stage done. After that came training, mostly under the old Bleriot system where you would fly alone in a machine and practise basic aerial manoeuvres in outdated planes. After passing the altitude tests and cross-country tests, you would earn either a French military brevet (a commission essentially) or a pilot\\'s license. Then you would move onto combat training, usually at Avord and Pau. Throughout these combat drills, you would be flying French Nieuports, the aircraft which most of the Escadrille Americaine started off on (but later switched from after poor performance reports). With training over, you would then be transferred to a pool of pilots at Le Plessis Belleville, with an opportunity to fly proper service machines which actual French pilots flew into combat. Once a slot opened up, you would be assigned to a squadron, most likely a French Groupes de Combat on Spad fighters. You would from then on fly combat missions across the Western Front in French uniforms, joining about 179 other American volunteers in the air. By 1917, with America\\'s entry into World War 1, you could choose to either remain in the Lafayette Flying Corps (with the Escadrille Americaine having been renamed the Escadrille Lafayette after complaints by the German ambassador in November 1916) or transfer to the United States Air Service. As 1918 came around however, you would most likely find yourself being transferred to new American squadrons as commanders or trainers, with the Escadrille Lafayette having been renamed the 103rd Pursuit Squadron of the United States Air Service. So, that\\'s your option if you fancy your skills with a plane and find the idea of dogfights over France and Belgium rather pleasant. But what if you wanted to enlist as a soldier? There was a simple answer to that: Canada. All you had to do was go up north and enlist as a member of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, fighting under the British Union Jack in Europe. It\\'s estimated that around 20,000-80,000 Americans fought in the First World War by enlisting in the Canadian Army, before being shipped off to the Western Front. Hope you found this response interesting, and let me know if you have any follow-ups on the matter!

       " 'It depends how you define \"accepted\". The church didn\\'t accept it as a valid way to break a marriage, and the couple were still married under common law. Church rules for marriage-ending focused on reasons why the marriage retroactively never counted (an annulment) - one spouse had been below the age of consent when the marriage occurred, there had never been a consummation, etc. - and divorces based on one spouse\\'s treatment of the other after the marriage were, for centuries in England, impossible to obtain. For the upper and middle classes, this meant very few ways of getting rid of each other, because they were prominent enough to local authorities that they would certainly be caught if they remarried bigamously. The wealthy could resort to a separation by deed, a legal document devised in the late seventeenth century which allowed two people to separate and contained agreements for custody and for the wife\\'s financial upkeep, but just as today, a legal separation didn\\'t allow people to remarry until their spouse\\'s death. There was also the option of a divorce a mensa et thoro, which was essentially the same thing but done through the church, and even more expensive. If initiated by a wife, she had to prove extreme abuse and flagrant adultery, with eyewitnesses, and without herself having done anything that could be perceived as provocation. And lastly, it also became possible from the late seventeenth century for the very wealthy (I believe every case of this I\\'ve ever seen involved a duke and duchess) to get an Act of Parliament to grant a full divorce that allowed for remarriage - an intense proceeding requiring the husband to prosecute his wife\\'s lover for \"criminal conversation\" in a court of law; once he won, he could move on to the divorce a mensa et thoro (since the adultery was proven), and then send a bill the House of Lords to be publicly debated and enacted. It\\'s not until 1857 that England had provision for a proper divorce court, and not until the twentieth century that men and women who wanted a divorce had to prove the same standards of guilt. The poor, on the other hand, had paradoxically less and more freedom. Less freedom because none of these formal, legally accepted options were available to them - more freedom because they simply weren\\'t under the same degree of scrutiny. (Or, I should say, not necessarily under the same degree of scrutiny. During Cromwell\\'s reign, for instance, there\\'s evidence of quite a lot of scrutiny being applied to moral crimes all the way down the social ladder.) One method for separating that was sometimes used, supposedly dating back to the early Middle Ages, was the divorce by sale, in which, as you describe, a husband led his wife to market with a rope around her neck and sold her. Was this accepted? Well, it was accepted among the people who practiced it - but it was not legal and not valid in the church, and anyone who remarried after such a divorce was open to charges of bigamy. You had to be fairly sure that you were insignificant enough for nobody to care what you did, because this was definitely a folk practice and nothing something broadly socially sanctioned. Divorce by sale obviously sounds like sex trafficking, but it\\'s important to look at the few actual cases we have recorded in which couples separated by another man \"buying\" the wife. For instance, one in 1795 involved the husband making a receipt that noted that the sale rested on \"both parties being willing to part\". On the other hand, there\\'s the experience of famed pirate Anne Bonny: she also tried to take advantage of the custom to get away from her abusive husband, but the governor of the Bahamas refused to recognize it and declared that by living with Jack Rackham she was exhibiting \"loose behavior\". It\\'s quite likely that this practice was more often a way for a woman to leave her husband for a man she already wanted to be married to, with the exchange of money lending it a feeling of formality and legality, rather than what we see in The Mayor of Casterbridge.',\n",

During the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period things are also pretty frantic and most records were mainly wars and conflicts.

       " \"There are many focus-and-efficieny reasons that are at the bottom of some. As well as concern for overloading centralized, administrative, technical, or practical resource services. Things so simple as managing multiple specialized applications or meeting differing federal requirements pertaining to specific tasks (healthcare privacy, confidentiality as relates to legal matters, and the different levels of required education and training to handle varied fields). However, one wrinkle that ends up creating some that I've personally witnessed working in government is the influence of political or campaign-related objectives. An agency gains the reputation as too bloated so they'll split part of it off into a separate agency or give a program to a different agency to make the former's budget look smaller. Someone will campaign on a specific healthcare, military, or economic issue and then have to find a way to either create a new agency/program or peel off and inflate part of an existing one.

       " 'I can speak to Europe c. 1500, since I just reviewed some of that history. Back in those days, the family unit was much more critical to a person’s survival than it is today, which I think many people don’t tend to appreciate. This was especially true for lower-class peasants who worked the land, who constituted around 90% of Europe’s population. Though there were opportunities in urban areas, most people lived in rural Europe and relied on their families for all aspects of their security - for healthcare if sick, for a home, for work/food, etc.. Most marriages at this time were negotiated/arranged between the fathers of the family, who were seen as the authority of the family unit. This negotiation included the contribution of both families to the new couple’s survival, including critical resources like land and dowries. Even though the family unit was organized with the father at the top, there were strict expectations for all family members to abide by. So, a husband couldn’t abuse his family (with a 16th century definition of abuse) or fail to provide for his family without social and legal repercussions. If a couple had disagreements, there was such a thing as legal separation. But, it often made life much harder for those involved, especially for the wives. So, many couples who came across problems tended to work them out themselves.',\n",
       " 'I\\'m gonna tackle this question in a few parts: 1) Disclaimer on sources, 2) was there religion in the Viking Age, 3) what is mythology and do the Norse texts fit. SOURCES If we limit ourselves primarily to written stories about gods or heroes, we have only two main traditions attested- a Norwegian/Icelandic/Orkney one, which produced the Prose and Poetic Eddas (the former written in c. 1220 by Snorri Sturluson, the latter compiled probably in the late 1100s, with the oldest manuscript dating to 1270) and a Danish one, represented with Saxo Grammaticus\\' Gesta Danorum from c. 1200. There are dramatically different accounts in these texts - while Loki is a major player in both Eddas in the death of Baldr, he is completely and totally absent in Saxo Grammaticus. Balderus in that text dies at the hands of Hotherus, due to a conflict over Baldr\\'s wife! This is tempting to read as evidence of Christianity distorting the text, if we\\'re cynical, or as evidence of wildly different oral traditions (if we\\'re optimistic). Neither of these are obviously true - after all, there are also dramatic differences between the Prose Edda and Ynglinga saga (which claims that Odin was a real person.. who was originally from Troy.. and conned the indigenous Scandinavian population into thinking he was a god) and those were both written by Snorri! So, identifying those as genuinely really old variations is very complicated just on the basis of textual material. While individual poems date to the 9th or 10th centuries, we by and large can\\'t access any practice in the Viking Age from them. Luckily, we do have other evidence, in place-names, runestones, and other accounts. Onomastics is complicated, and while some of the assumptions in the history of the field are a bit iffy, there are also some non-controversial mythological place names. Sometimes these confirm the stories in the Eddas, and sometimes they don\\'t - Loki is totally unattested in place names, while Ullr is all over the place in central Sweden (meanwhile, Loki\\'s a big name in poems like Haustlöng, from the 10th century, and Ullr is nearly totally absent in the textual record). On the flip side, something really easily identifiable as Thor fishing up the Midgard Serpent is attested in Sweden (Altuna runestone), Northumbria (Gosforth Cross), the Orkneys (Hymiskviða), and Iceland (the Edda manuscripts). The hero Sigurðr is also a really good example of this - he is in the Poetic Edda, in a prose saga, depicted on the Hyllestad stave church doorframe (in the National Museum of Oslo), and on numerous runestones. Also in Beowulf and the Nibelungenlied in altered forms (Sigemund and Siegfried, respectively) VIKING RELIGIONS It\\'s clear that the relationship between the mythological texts and actual practice is complicated. If you read a modern collection of Norse mythology, the stories seem relatively coherent, with a clear beginning and end. This isn\\'t what actually goes on - there wasn\\'t one, or two, or three variants - there were likely hundreds. Religious practice was highly localized - the extent of organization varied from the individual to the pan-Scandinavian. One attested organization is a goði, or chieftain/priest, running seasonal sacrifices for the local community, as appears in Hákonar saga góða\\'s Yule feasts. In the same vein, Gamla Uppsala\\'s supra-regional importance suggests at least some level of continuity, even if the tradition described there is clearly different from that preserved in the eddic material - Adam of Bremen (a problematic source, but the best we\\'ve got and probably more-or-less right on this much) says that Thor is the chief deity there, something that seems to be the case among much of Scandinavia based off onomastics and the evidence in the later sagas (even Snorri says, in the 13th c. Prose Edda, that there are so many stories about Thor that would never be able to tell them all). There\\'s clearly some amount of continuity and shared rituals organized on a local to regional basis. So, here we start to answer your question! Scholars of Nordic religious studies do still use the term religion for it. They have moved away from calling it \"Pagan Norse religion\" (a term that shows up with some regularity in scholarship from the 1940s) and instead use the acronym PCNR, or Pre-Christian Nordic Religions. Plural. They\\'re a set of closely related religious practices that generated the oral narrative traditions preserved in the eddas and some legendary sagas. WHY IS IT CALLED MYTHOLOGY Mythology as a term is notoriously difficult to define. u/itsallfolklore may be better-suited to chime in with the broad theories of mythology, but a plausible working definition for this purpose seems to be that it is a written collection of stories attributed to a non-Christian worldview usually about gods or heroes. Obviously, this then entangles a healthy dose of belief - mythology is what you believe, religion is what I believe. However, particularly in the 18th century onward, there\\'s often desire to \"return\" to these mythologies, rooted in Romantic nationalism and a desire to \"escape\" the \"weakening impulses\" of Christianity. It also, notably, has no place for ritual - the religious practices that the mythology came from are stripped away, and in some cases seem to be completely lost. That should answer the second part, then - in short, the Eddas do not reflect a religion, but are remnants of an oral tradition that existed around the rituals and rites of the religion itself. The attribution of mythologies to a pre-Christian past, unfortunately, doesn\\'t have to be genuine, to be clear (Irish mythology is not actually straightforwardly mythology), but the early collectors of mythologies presented it as such. This is, of course, to some extent modeled of of Greek mythology (the word itself is derived from Greek muthos, or story) - Jacob Grimm\\'s Deutsche Mytologie seeks to discover the Germanic counterpart to Rome through the Norse gods. It\\'s ultimately looking back to something that is questionably old and saying \"this is ancient\". In an ideal world, I think lots of scholars would gladly discard the term \"mythology,\" but it\\'s so embedded in the cultural landscape that we\\'ve got to work around it as best we can. So, does Norse mythology fit? It is based in things from the Viking Age or even earlier, it is about gods and heroes, and in some ways it does reflect something fundamentally non-Christian. The sources are all in some way complicated and dubious, and in the case of the Prose Edda, are clearly based on Christian and Greek stories and beliefs popular in Continental Europe (did you know, in the Prose Edda, that Thor is canonically Hector from the Iliad?) It is some part literary fiction, some part recording of oral tales akin to what folklorists did in the 19th century, and a third part contemporary commentary. As with all mythology, the Norse material is complicated, but does seem to fit our definition. &#x200B; This is a whole lot, but I hope that explains a little bit about PCNRs, their relationship with the mythological writings, and why we still distinguish those from each other and from later folklore!',\n",
       " 'In response to the summons from /u/sagathain, this is a recent answer dealing with the question about why its Norse \"mythology\" but Christian \"religion\": This is a great question, and the answer has to do more with courtesy to the living than accuracy in terms. Several weeks ago, I wrote the following (amended here slightly): The term \"mythology\" is problematic because it is used in radically different ways by different people. I taught \"Mythology and Folklore\" at the university level for over the span of four decades, and I found it useful to use this term exclusively for the recorded narratives of ancient people, narratives that were based on contemporaneous oral traditions. According to this approach, \"mythologies\" are the written expression of oral narratives of the folklore of ancient people. This literature is populated with a range of supernatural beings and heroes. It includes etiological legends - stories told to be believed that explained the origin of things. The stories also included historical legends - stories about historical times, describing cultural heroes who confronted a range of opponents, often including supernatural beings. I do not apply the term \"mythology\" to modern expressions of religion or folklore because the word can take on a judgmental tone. I had Native American students in my classes who took offense when other students asked about \"Indian mythologies.\" The problem here was that these students often had parents or grandparents who were full participants in pre-contact belief systems, and \"Indian mythologies\" meant to them, \"stories about superstitious if not silly beliefs.\" Consider the difference between referring to the Christian narrative as \"the story of the Resurrection\" as opposed to the \"myth of the Resurrection.\" The second alternative implies that the Resurrection may be a nice story, but it is not to be taken as truth. This standard regarding the use of the term \"mythology\" is not universal and it is not without problems. By applying it to the belief systems and traditions of pre-conversion Scandinavia, we run the risk of stepping on the toes of Neo-Pagans - and that\\'s not fair. By not applying the term \"mythology\" to other active religions with narratives grounded in the fantastic, we are implying something about those modern faiths that may not hold water when viewed objectively. Hence your valid question, which is best answered with the desire not to be cruel or to start an argument with living believers. Over the years, I put together an Introduction to Folklore for my students, borrowing heavily from my mentor\\'s similar work - Sven S. Liljeblad (1899-2000); for more on him, see my article Nazis, Trolls and the Grateful Dead The following from the Introduction deals with various terms used in folklore, and addresses how folklorists tend to lean into the term \"mythology\" - although there is no consistency even among folklorists!: European folklorists, following the lead of the folk themselves, have long recognized two forms of oral tradition, Sagen and Märchen, legends and folktales. While there are many other forms of oral tradition, legends and folktales stand in opposition to one another, yet share a great deal. In reality, lines can blur. Legends – or Sagen as the profession often prefers – are generally short, single-episodic stories told chiefly in the daytime. More importantly, the teller intended the listener to believe the story. Legends often have horrible ending to underscore the story’s important message. Many of them are, after all, meant to be instructive, to serve as warnings in some way. These types of stories are not necessarily long-lived. Their point is to reinforce and prove the legitimacy of a belief. Nonetheless, some legends take on a traditional character, can become multi-episodic, and migrate over considerable spans of time and space. Folktales – or Märchen, again using the German, technical term – are longer stories with more than one episode. They are restricted, in theory at least, to evening presentation. A folktale is not to be believed, taking place in a fantastic setting. The European folktale also requires a happy ending, the cliché of “happily ever after.” Any given folktale can be told with considerable variation, but they are traditional in basic form, and folklorists have spent decades tracing the history and distribution of these stories. Besides the legend and the folktale, there is also the folk ballad, a specialized form of oral tradition that, like the others, incorporated a wide range of beliefs. The ballad had roots in medieval Europe, combining narrative and song. The ballad usually focused on a single incident, and it almost always emphasizes action. Something also needs to be said here about myth. People use this term awkwardly. In a European context, myths tend to be the artificial constructs of ancient and Classical-era priests or literate people who sought to weave folk traditions into a comprehensive whole. The exercise often had political purposes, designed to provide diverse people with a single set of beliefs and stories. By reconciling similar traditions, the shared culture of these groups could be seen as more important than the differences, justifying the central rule of the king and his priests. Myth is also a way of organizing and reconciling folk traditions, which by their nature can be contradictory and highly localized. Myth tends, however, to make gods of supernatural beings, giving those powerful entities a status – for modern readers – similar to the Judeo-Christian-Islamic God, even when this comparison is not justified. Of course, it is also important to point out that myths were stories that were told – and then written down – and they were different from religion itself. Many myths were simply the shared cultural inheritance of a group of people. In general, the word myth is best set aside when discussing more recent folk traditions, recognizing its proper status as a literary genre. Nonetheless, ancient documents recording myths can assist in understanding the history of various stories and beliefs. The authors of these texts were, after all, the first folklorists, and they were the only ones coming close to practicing the craft at the time. Some folklorists carelessly use the term myth to denote those legends that deal with a fantastic, remote time. This primal era saw the creation of many familiar things such as day and night, fire, animals, people, mountains, and all other aspects of the present world. Folklorists properly refer to these stories as etiological legends explaining the origin of things. Sometimes, however, people interchange etiological legends with the word myth. The problem with this is that “myth” can imply something that is inherently wrong, linked to “primitive” superstitious beliefs. When the term “myth” is used for the folklore of existing cultures or for the traditions that were viable only a generation or more ago, it can take on an insulting, derogatory tone. It is best to reserve the word “myth” for ancient and Classical-era texts.',\n",
       " 'The problem with Jefferson and slavery is the perpetual muddiness that persists due to his duality of word and action. As a result, to scratch the surface is an arduous and lengthy undertaking. That really is a great interview with Wood and I even recently cited it myself in a discussion about slavery and our founding. The interview is actually about and deals mainly with the NYT 1619 Project\\'s opening essay by Nikole Hannah-Jones, which he references in my quote below (to explain that a bit). But I think there is a misinterpretation here, and first I\\'m going to include a little more of that interview to see a portion of the progression from 1776 to 1820 (when the \"fire bell\" quote was made), then address your question directly; Q. Hannah-Jones refers to America’s founding documents as its founding myths… A. Of course, there are great ironies in our history, but the men and the documents transcend their time. That Jefferson, a slaveholding aristocrat, has been—until recently—our spokesman for democracy, declaring that all men are created equal, is probably the greatest irony in American history. But the document he wrote and his confidence in the capacities of ordinary people are real, and not myths. Jefferson was a very complicated figure. He took a stand against slavery as a young man in Virginia. He spoke out against it. He couldn’t get his colleagues to go along, but he was certainly courageous in voicing his opposition to slavery. Despite his outspokenness on slavery and other enlightened matters, his colleagues respected him enough to keep elevating him to positions in the state. His colleagues could have, as we say today, “cancelled” him if they didn’t have some sympathy for what he was saying. Q. And after the Revolution? A. American leaders think slavery is dying, but they couldn’t have been more wrong. Slavery grows stronger after the Revolution, but it’s concentrated in the South. North of the Mason-Dixon line, in every northern state by 1804, slavery is legally put on the road to extinction. Now, there’s certain “grandfathering in,” and so you do have slaves in New Jersey as late as the eve of the Civil War. But in the northern states, the massive movement against slavery was unprecedented in the history of the world. So to somehow turn this around and make the Revolution a means of preserving slavery is strange and contrary to the evidence. As a result of the Revolution, slavery is confined to the South, and that puts the southern planters on the defensive. For the first time they have to defend the institution. If you go into the colonial records and look at the writings and diary of someone like William Byrd, who’s a very distinguished and learned person—he’s a member of the Royal Society—you’ll find no expressions of guilt whatsoever about slavery. He took his slaveholding for granted. But after the Revolution that’s no longer true. Southerners began to feel this anti-slave pressure now. They react to it by trying to give a positive defense of slavery. They had no need to defend slavery earlier because it was taken for granted as a natural part of a hierarchical society. We should understand that slavery in the colonial period seemed to be simply the most base status in a whole hierarchy of dependencies and degrees of unfreedom. Indentured servitude was prevalent everywhere. Half the population that came to the colonies in the 18th century came as bonded servants. Servitude, of course, was not slavery, but it was a form of dependency and unfreedom that tended to obscure the uniqueness of racial slavery. Servants were bound over to masters for five or seven years. They couldn’t marry. They couldn’t own property. They belonged to their masters, who could sell them. Servitude was not life-time and was not racially-based, but it was a form of dependency and unfreedom. The Revolution attacked bonded servitude and by 1800 it scarcely existed anywhere in the US. The elimination of servitude suddenly made slavery more conspicuous than it had been in a world of degrees of unfreedom. The antislavery movements arose out of these circumstances. As far as most northerners were concerned, this most base and despicable form of unfreedom must be eliminated along with all the other forms of unfreedom. These dependencies were simply incompatible with the meaning of the Revolution. After the Revolution, Virginia had no vested interest in the international slave trade. Quite the contrary. Virginians began to grow wheat in place of tobacco. Washington does this, and he comes to see himself as more a farmer than a planter. He and other farmers begin renting out their slaves to people in Norfolk and Richmond, where they are paid wages. And many people thought that this might be the first step toward the eventual elimination of slavery. These anti-slave sentiments don’t last long in Virginia, but for a moment it seemed that Virginia, which dominated the country as no other state ever has, might abolish slavery as the northern states were doing. In fact, there were lots of manumissions and other anti-slave moves in Virginia in the 1780s. But the black rebellion in Saint-Domingue—the Haitian Revolution—scares the bejesus out of the southerners. Many of the white Frenchmen fled to North America—to Louisiana, to Charleston, and they brought their fears of slave uprisings with them. Then, with Gabriel’s Rebellion in Virginia in 1800, most of the optimism that Virginians had in 1776—1790 is gone. Of course, I think the ultimate turning point for both sections is the Missouri crisis of 1819–1820. Up to that point, both sections lived with illusions. The Missouri crisis causes the scales to fall away from the eyes of both northerners and southerners. Northerners come to realize that the South really intended to perpetuate slavery and extend it into the West. And southerners come to realize that the North is so opposed to slavery that it will attempt to block them from extending it into the West. From that moment on I think the Civil War became inevitable. Cont\\'d',\n",
       " 'Streicher had indeed been Gauleiter of Franconia, but he lost all of his political power in 1940 when he was removed from office for his embezzlement - to put it crudely, he forgot to share with the right people. An early and ardent supporter of the Nazis, his newspaper Der Stuermer (The Stormer) was infamous at home and abroad for its extreme antisemitism. It published conspiracy theories such as blood libels and the \\'Elders of Zion\\' calumny and borderline pornographic racist caricatures of Jews. Even though its official circulation was not particularly high compared to other Nazi newspapers, it was often displayed where everyone could see. During the 1936 Olympics, an order had to be given to take down the newspaper from public display so that it didn\\'t shock tourists. After his removal from power, Streicher retired to his house and continued to publish his newspaper from there. The circulation continued to decline. Despite that, Streicher had already made his name as Germany\\'s most infamous Jew-baiter. In June 1945, the British drew up a list of ten defendants for the planned international war crimes trial that would become the IMT, and Streicher was on it together with Goering, Hess, Ribbentrop, Ley, Keitel, Kaltenbrunner, Rosenberg, Frank, and Frick. All ten were eventually indicted, together with fourteen others (twenty-one actually stood trial due to one suicide, one being tried in absentia, and one being terminally ill). Looking back at this preliminary list, Streicher does appear a bit out of place. Streicher was not the only misfit in the dock - Hans Fritzsche was another propagandist, Goebbels\\' deputy\\'s deputy, and completely unknown to most people. Fritzsche, however, did not appear to be an ardent Nazi (he joined the party when it was already in power), he claimed that his propaganda had not been too different from the propaganda of any other country, he was polite, and his protestations of ignorance of atrocities sounded at least somewhat convincing (even if they were later proven to be false). In the end, he was acquitted. Streicher, by comparison, continued to be openly antisemitic, saying, for example, the following: LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: You may call them Jewish people a race or a nation, whichever you like, now; but you were saying, on 1 April 1933, that they were a \"nation of blood-suckers and extortioners.\" Do you call that preaching hatred? STREICHER: That is a statement, the expression of a conviction which can be proved on the basis of historical facts. LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Understand me. I did not ask you whether it was a fact or not. I am asking whether you called it preaching hatred. Your answer is \"yes\" or \"no.\" STREICHER: No, it is not preaching hatred; it is just a statement of facts. IMT vol. 12 p. 348 That got him on the bad side of everyone including the judges. The fact that there seemed to be a clear path from Streicher\\'s words to the horrible atrocities the courtroom was shown footage of didn\\'t help. The judges agreed quite quickly to convict him, though they dropped Count One - conspiracy - because he was simply too unimportant in the grand scheme of things, and kept only Count Four - crimes against humanity. However, not everyone agreed. One of the aides to the US judge was worried about if that was right - \"Streicher might be a beastly man, but he never killed anyone himself.\" (Tusa 457) The issue was if Streicher\\'s words could be linked decisively to other people\\'s deeds. From the US perspective and its standards of freedom of speech, Streicher\\'s conviction was unjust. Another US aide, however, compared him to a cheerleader of sorts, who encourages the crowd to cheer louder and supports the team that way. The Tusas write that Streicher was judged for how repulsive he was; Bradley Smith remarks that the judges sentenced him to death like stepping on a worm. Nobody particularly cared about Streicher\\'s fate, but historians generally express uncertainty over whether executing him for basically incitement was just.

It\\'s no exaggeration to say this sent more ripples through the scientific community than the religious one, as scientists struggled to fit this strange not-man but not-ape into the evolutionary tree. The difficulty was further compounded by the fact Neanderthals and homo sapiens (us - what I\\'ll call \"humans\" for simplicity) coexisted and were even (scandalously) sometimes buried together. Did we evolve from them, were they the \"missing link\"? Why then were they still around after we entered the scene, and how did they remain so morphologically distinct? Were they an entirely new kind of human who no longer existed? Possibly, but what a radical idea! One which challenged the sacrosanct idea of us being totally unique and superior in the whole of existence, a belief strongly held by the religious and scientific alike. Were these strange fossils evidence of some kind of disease among humans, or perhaps a very extreme race of humans? Were they closer to what we\\'d considered a \"person\", or were they simply anatomically similar non-human apes? Religiously - and to be clear I\\'m referring specifically to Christian Creationism - there was already an answer, and like all answers it was to be found in the Bible. Interestingly the Creationist stance was that Neanderthals were as human as anyone else. They were quite simply an extreme product of the Tower of Babel, that episode where all humankind attempted to build a tower that could reach Heaven and, presumably, God. God, as He was wont to do at the time, didn\\'t take kindly to this hubris and (so the story goes) scattered humans all over the world and gave them different languages, to prevent any future uppity architecture. The Neanderthals were simply a far-flung result of this, the Creationists reasoned. ~~They then very obviously met their end during the Flood of Noah.~~ EDIT: u/DoctorWhoSeason24 correctly pointed out the Flood preceded the Tower of Babel - my bad! Having fit Neanderthals neatly into the Bible narrative, Creationists went about \"proving\" what they already knew to be true. For example an orthodontist named Cuozzo deduced by studying Neanderthal dentition in x-rays that Neanderthals grew constantly throughout their lives and lived to be several hundred years old. Therefore their odd appearance was simply that of a human like you or I who never stopped growing and changing over several centuries. Unsurprisingly these \"findings\" weren\\'t accepted by the larger scientific community. It didn\\'t take long after the discovery of Neanderthals for science to roll out yet another \"not-us\" humanoid: homo erectus in 1891, followed by ever increasing types of humanoids such as Australopithecus and homo florensis (the meter tall humanoids often called \"Hobbits\"). Creationists shuffled these around for the next hundred years as the variety was, surprisingly, more of a challenge than the single aberration of Neanderthal. As more humanoids were discovered which blurred the line between \"us\" and apes... well it was starting to look dangerously close to proving the \"Evolutionists\" correct that humans had indeed descended from apes, which was obviously a non-starter for Creationists. Some maintained that like Neanderthals these were other extinct races of humans, cast out during the Babel episode. Others rethought the past position on Neanderthals being humans and believed all these odd fossils to be various types of (non-human) apes. And still others felt the whole thing was likely an \"Evolutionist\" hoax, created by mix-and-matching human and ape remains. There was a belief among many Creationists that back in the days of Eden animals had been much superior to what we now have (what rubbish animals are these days, amirite?). Therefore apes around the time of Creation/Eden/Expulsion were far advanced to what we see today and were capable of walking nearly upright and were in general more similar to the pinnacle of Creation, Man. Unfortunately animals had degraded since then, which explained why apes had regressed to what we have now. Ironically, in their own way Creationists had invented reverse-evolution. However the idea of the process working the other way - primitive animals becoming more \"advanced\" or modern - was a bridge too far. Although Neanderthals had already been welcomed at the human dinnertable, newly discovered humanoid remains had to be sorted into either \"human\" or \"ape\". Unfortunately Creationists couldn\\'t agree which were which. Perhaps all those that walked upright were human? some Creationists postulated, which was an acceptable and simple enough delineation. Others felt superior ancient-apes could also walk fully upright, and instead we should look at the teeth (dubiously claiming all apes have fierce canines, and those without were human). Others felt we should focus on the brow-ridge; all the fossils have a prominent brow-ridge which humans don\\'t have. Unfortunately neither do orangutans. The Creationists took all this and went in a very unexpected direction: Neanderthal had already been decided to be human, having had the luck to be first in line, as well as having been found in the rather compromising position of being buried with humans. Creationists were sure humans hadn\\'t evolved, therefore all the remaining troublesome fossils had to be fully either human or ape - obviously there could be no intermediate iterations, as after all God had created Man in His image on the 6th Day and wouldn\\'t have mucked about with ape-men protypes. Creationists therefore decided all the other fossils were indeed those of apes, including that of our true ancestor, homo erectus. That problem sorted, they were ironically left with the same conundrum they faced over 150 years ago - how to reconcile Neanderthals and humans? The answer, they decided, was that Neanderthals were the original people of the Bible (ie, Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah and Shem, Abraham and Sarah - all Neanderthals) and we humans are modern Neanderthals. This notion reconciled the existence of Neanderthal and the mixed burials, but did unfortunately little to explain why Neanderthals and modern humans look so strikingly different. They reckoned the reason we no longer see Neanderthal morphology among humans is because we now live a mere century or less, whereas (they decided with the help of those like our dear aforementioned orthodontist) ancient Neanderthals lived to be several hundred years old and grew into their rugged Neanderthal looks (remember that from early on?). This conclusion was bolstered by the many Biblical accounts of people living to be well in advance of 100, up to get nearly 1,000 years old (such as Noah and Methusela). Much like the apes who\\'d started out walking fully erect and become more ambulatorily impoverished as they got chronologically further from Creation, the human lifespan had, through a similar degradation, grown shorter and shorter as time went on. If we only lived long enough, Creationists postulated, we\\'d age into Neanderthals. So, that\\'s the story of the Neanderthal and the apes. We\\'re Neanderthals - or rather, they\\'re us. Amazingly, as science proves through more and more avenues that not only are we not Neanderthal but we\\'re not even the same branch of human, Creationists find more \"evidence\" to prove we are in fact Neanderthal. And very ironically our true direct ancestors (as proven by DNA etc) they classify as ape. If you think about it, it\\'s incredibly clever in its obfuscation and at the same time they\\'re so incredibly close to the truth. Anyways, stay strong my Neanderthal brothers. https://answersingenesis.org/human-evolution/neanderthal/those-enigmatic-neanderthals/ https://www.grisda.org/how-do-neanderthals-fit-with-a-biblical-model-1',\n",
       " 'Your scepticism is well considered as both terms carry different meanings amongst historians depending on the context in which it is used. Defining a \"unfree peasant\" and a \"free peasant\" can be a challenging task for medievalists - there\\'s a lot of nuance to consider. I\\'ll start by defining an unfree peasant, delve into the complexities of that classification, and then use that to conclude with how these complexities translate to the consideration as to what a free peasant is. But before I continue I need to say that I am not well versed in the situation of the \\'peasant classes\\' outside of Medieval Europe - so I won’t speak beyond that area. But I would like to briefly acknowledge (and encourage others to elaborate on) the disparate and varied conditions of the tenant labourer & service classes outside of Europe - as they were myriad and should be brought into this discussion by those more familiar with the subject than I. An unfree peasant is generally considered by medievalists to be any peasant that was, well, not free. This could mean several things; the most common form of an unfree peasant would fall under the catchall term \\'serf\\'. Trying to define a serf universally is essentially impossible; as a serf in Russia in the 1600s lived under very different conditions and circumstances than a serf in the Holy Roman Empire during the 10th century. But while we can\\'t define them universally we can try to define them generally: A serf is a peasant farmer who was bound to the land they lived on, usually from birth, and could be brought or sold along with that land (exceptions to be noted later), had little to no rights over their bodies, and could not leave the land they were bound to or marry without their lord\\'s permission. This condition (at least in Western Europe) is commonly believed to have evolved from the Colonus/Coloni system used in the late Roman Empire. But it is important to note that while the condition of serfdom was similar to slavery - it categorically was not. Slaves were a distinct social class within society, and had even less rights, privileges, and protections than the average serf. But while this is the \\'golden standard\\' of an unfree peasant, let us define some of the different categories and contexts in which the term was used. This will, obviously, not be a comprehensive list. Kholops: A form of unfree peasant particular to the Kieven Rus and later Russia whose masters had unlimited control over their lives. While often defined as \\'unfree peasants\\' others would instead describe them simply as slaves, in all but name. ( Richard Hellie. Slavery in Russia, 1450-1725, 1984) Villeins: A more precise way to refer to the highly varied conditions of unfree peasants in England and to a lesser extent France. Closely based in Roman law - they could be traded separately from land (en gross) or not (regardant) - but could generally own property, paid fines to be afforded various privileges (such as not being beaten, or to be married), but yet - except when their lord was concerned - were \\'free\\' in the eyes of the law. Arthur H. Johnson, amongst some other medievalists, would even classify peasants under particularly lenient Villein conditions as \\'free peasants\\'; this is not a popular stance in more recent historiography. (The Disappearance of the Small Landowner, 1909) Smerd: Another category of peasant found in medieval Slavic states. From the 11th to 15th century, the Smerd gradually lost more and more of their freedoms. While the early conditions of the Smerd would often be described as those of a free peasant, they would gradually come to have one of the more strict and unfree styles of serfdom. At what point do we stop defining them as free peasants and begin to define them as unfree? (Jerome Blum. The Smerd in Kievan Russia, 2017) As we can see, the distinction between the two groups – free and unfree – can be foggy. Is a peasant free just because they are acknowledged as such outside the authority of their lord? Or do they require the right to leave their parcel of land freely? What if they can leave their land but lack any rights or freedoms outside of their lord’s protection? And then at what point does an unfree peasant just become a slave – what is the threshold at which indentured servitude becomes something far worse? Medievalists have spent a lot of time making these distinctions and trying to settle on clear categorical definitions – but the countless styles of peasantry and serfdom make it quite the challenge. Matters only become worse when we consider broader historical contexts. For example; many historians would define an individual living in, say, 17th century England that had the most enviable of legal rights and conditions by the standards of their 11th century counterpart as still being unfree, for when compared to their contemporaries they likely would have been perceived as such. Now that isn’t to say that a tenant farmer in the 17th century was living a life resplendent with freedoms – but we need to remember that what freedom is and isn’t is often defined against, and within the context of, what is considered unfree. Contemporary primary source accounts only further complicate this issue, especially in later periods: what did freedom mean for a revolutionary pamphleteer in 18th century France? What would the positions of a probably-privileged-writer in England be when using terms like “free” and “unfree” to define the peasant classes when writing about, say, the Enclosure Acts – which removed free access to the common lands from many farmers, but didn’t remove, say, their bodily autonomy, or right to marry without a lord’s permission? But then, to conclude – what is a “free peasant”. Now, the common responses to this question would be; Boyers, Freeholders, Yeomen and the various other free-tenant classes that generally weren’t to be traded or purchased, bound to land, nor sometimes even lord. But I hope the earlier parts of this answer lead you to consider this answer with scepticism. Because while these individuals had more rights than their peers, there are medievalists that would still complicate this matter further – in particular, due to the lowly ‘vagabond’. For while the vagabond lacked legal protections, was often persecuted, and tended to a hard life – they possessed a remarkable amount of independence and freedom from lords, laws, and implicit bondage: At the core of the concept of vagabondage were two key elements—voluntary unemployment and itinerancy—both of which, historically, were connected with labor and residence obligations of medieval serfdom… after 1500, western European governments continued to enforce policies against vagabondage, with few other means by which to control and harvest the labor of an otherwise independent and disordered underclass. A. L. Beir. Masterless Men: The Vagrancy Problem in England, 1560–1640, 1985. So who is more free? Someone who is safe and has protections under the law, but carries with those rights various restrictions and bondages to lord and rent – if not land? Or someone who holds almost no protections or safety under the law, but may live with far more independence and separation from lord and lease? I can’t answer this question for you – but know that whatever answer you choose, it is born out of the context you live in and the breadth of your experience – as it would when any medievalist considers which peoples were, or were not, qualified as “free”.',\n",
       " 'The short answer to your question is that in border states the views on secession were not homogenous, and many people from states that stayed in the Union supported the Confederacy, and many people from states that seceded were Unionists (most notably, of course, West Virginia actually left Virginia and was admitted to the Union on June 20, 1863). I\\'m going to address why someone from Maryland (Booth\\'s home state) would have been a Confederate supporter, and then go into specifically why Booth himself was so fanatical (at least as much as we know why he acted the way he did, or that the way he acted was based in any sort of rational thought). In 1860, there were around 90,000 slaves in Maryland, and the free black population was roughly the same size. One in six white families in Maryland owned at least one slave---the reason that these families would have supported the Confederacy (in general) is clear. Moreover, many whites who did not own slaves were against abolition, just as poor whites in Southern states who did not own slaves were against abolition. In 1860, Maryland was a critical strategic point for the Union. Washington, D.C. was (and is) border by Maryland on three sides and Virginia on the fourth. Virginia having already seceded, Maryland\\'s departure from the Union would have put the capital in great danger. On April 19, in what we know now as the Baltimore Riot of 1861, the 6th MA militia regiment, on their way to D.C., passed through Baltimore. (At the time, Baltimore did not have a direct railroad through the city, so the Union soldiers had to detrain, walk roughly 10 blocks, and then board the train to D.C.) The 6th MA was under strict orders not to initiate gunfire, but after members of the mob fired pistols into the marching soldiers, they returned fire. At the end of the day, the soldiers had killed 12 Baltimoreans, and wounded an unknown amount of others, and four members of the 6th MA had been killed by the mob, along with 36 wounded. The Maryland state song to this day, Maryland, My Maryland, written by James Ryder Randall, references the riot: \"The despot\\'s heel is on thy shore, Maryland! / His torch is at thy temple door, Maryland! Avenge the patriotic gore/ That flecked the streets of Baltimore/ And be the battle queen of yore / Maryland! My Maryland!\" On April 29, the day that the Maryland state legislature voted, 53-13, against secession, voted against opening rail lines to Union soldiers, and asked Lincoln to remove federal troops from the state, both of which Lincoln ignored. In response to the former directive, the Governor of Maryland, in support of the legislature, allegedly ordered the destruction of numerous railroad bridges within the state. John Merryman, a lieutenant in a Maryland militia, was arrested on May 25 for his connection with the bridge-burning. Chief Justice Roger Taney, a wealthy, slave-owning Marylander who had previously presided over the now-infamous Dred Scott decision, issued a writ of habeas corpus, requiring that George Cadwalader, the general commanding Fort McHenry, where Merryman was being held, either bring Merryman to a court or release him. Cadwalader refused, and Lincoln supported Cadwalader. Taney wrote his opinion, stating that it was an unconstitutional use of presidential power, and then, as he was also one of the two federal judges for Maryland, refused to try Merryman at any point during the war, determining that he would not receive a fair trial in wartime Maryland. Lincoln famously said, on July 4 1861, “Are all the laws, but one habeas corpus, to go unexecuted, and the government itself go to pieces, lest that one be violated?” Booth himself, like many Marylanders, supported the claim that the suspension of habeas corpus was unconstitutional. Now, let\\'s dive into the life of John Wilkes Booth. John Wilkes Booth was born near Bel Air, Maryland on May 10, 1838. His family owned a large farm, around 150 acres, and his family, just like the state of Maryland, was divided on the morality of slavery. His father was said by some (including Edwin, Booth\\'s older brother, who himself was a staunch Unionist) to have hated slavery, but the Booth farm was at times worked by slaves rented from neighbors. We know what John himself would come to think of slavery, from a letter he wrote which was published during the manhunt in the New York Times in 1865—“And looking upon African Slavery from the same stand-point held by the noble framers of our constitution, I for one, have ever considered it one of the greatest blessings (both for themselves and us,) that God has ever bestowed upon a favored nation.” Junius Brutus Booth, the family patriarch, was an actor, and so were the three brothers John Wilkes, Edwin, and Junius Jr. John Wilkes had a flair for the dramatic, as many actors do, and his favorite role to play was Brutus: killer of the dictator Caesar. Critics and contemporaries described Booth as more vigorous and energetic on stage than his brother Edwin, who was typically more subdued. The three brothers performed together once, on November 25, 1864, when John Wilkes played Mark Antony and Edwin upstaged John Wilkes in playing Brutus in Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar. John Wilkes Booth was strongly anti-abolitionist. He attended John Brown’s hanging in 1859, and was greatly satisfied with what had befallen Brown. According to his sister, Asia, John Wilkes smuggled quinine into the South on theater tours, when it was difficult to purchase due to the Union blockades. He was arrested at least twice for “treasonous” speech, once in Albany in 1861, and once in St. Louis in 1863—it seems on both occasions he expressed verbal support for the Confederacy. In 1864, he was involved in an abortive plot to kidnap Lincoln, which morphed after Lee’s surrender at Appomattox into the assassination. By 1864, John Wilkes and Edwin were estranged, and Asia remembered John Wilkes as a ranting, raving man, who reserved a special hatred for Lincoln. On April 11, 1865, Lincoln gave a speech from the White House window, in which he suggested extending the vote to African-Americans, and Booth flew into a rage. He killed Lincoln three days later, on April 14, Good Friday, 1865. After he had shot Lincoln and jumped onto the stage, he infamously shouted “Sic semper tyrannis,” the words Brutus is said to have said after he killed Caesar. One of the difficulties in answering this question is that the fanaticism John Wilkes Booth felt for the Confederate cause was very likely irrational. I hope I\\'ve explained why it\\'s not necessarily contradictory that Booth was from Maryland but supported secession. However, beyond that, the devotion to the Southern cause required to kill Lincoln was not one that at that point in the war could have been based in a logical train of thought. We know that Booth was ashamed at not having fought in the war—he was in his early 20s during it, but he had promised his mother he would not enlist. He later wrote to her, about that decision, ”I have begun to deem myself a coward and to despise my own existence.\" Some historians have argued that he felt the need to upstage his brother Edwin; he certainly must have seen himself as a parallel to Brutus, who was his favorite character to play and the origin of his most infamous quote. However, when all is said and done, Wilkes Booth certainly possessed an irrational hatred for Lincoln and an irrational fervor for the Southern cause, or he was just attempting to dramatically write himself into the history books.',\n",
       " 'To tackle a few assumptions here: John Wilkes Booth was born in Maryland, which was a slave state and didn\\'t outlaw slavery until 1864 (Source: Peter Kolchin, American Slavery: 1619–1877, New York: Hill and Wang, 1993, pp. 81–82) Booth was an avid supporter of slavery practically his whole life, and even dressed up in a stolen uniform in order to get closer to watch the hanging of an abolitionist. When the Civil War broke out, he wrote a long speech decrying Abraham Lincoln himself as the man responsible for the Union breaking up. (Source: Rhodehamel, John; Taper, Louise, eds. . Right or Wrong, God Judge Me: The Writings of John Wilkes Booth. Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois. pp. 55–64.) In Maryland, when the Civil War started, there were large swaths of the population who wanted to break off and join the CSA, so it\\'s not hard to assume that John Wilkes Booth rubbed shoulders with this segment of the population. Although the Maryland Legislature voted heavily in favor of staying with the Union, they didn\\'t allow Union troops to travel by rail and requested that Union troops be withdrawn from Maryland. This is eventually what led Abraham Lincoln to suspend the Writ of Habeus Corpus and instituted martial law in Baltimore (where John Wilkes Booth\\'s family is listed to have resided in the 1860 census) and also another source in Kauffman\\'s American Brutus as a situation that could have caused the radicalization of Booth. In Stefan Lorent\\'s Life of Abraham Lincoln, they further postulate based on some recorded conversations between Booth and his brother Edwin who was pro-Union that while Booth certainly supported slavery and the Confederacy (as plenty of Marylanders did), he very much hated Lincoln since he viewed him as a despot. So, Booth was probably a fanatical supporter of the Confederacy based on his upbringing and who he rubbed shoulders with since Maryland, being a border state, had both northern and southern sympathies with a mix of pro and anti-slavery individuals, along with his perception of the events that happened to his family and state which could have further radicalized him. In Kaufman\\'s American Brutus he suggests that John Wilkes Booth \"Admired Southern Succession as Heroic\", and may have begun the path to radicalization when Booth\\'s Oil Business went bust',\n",
       " 'Greetings! This is a most interesting question you have put forwards, and it is something which remains a topic of historiographical importance within the First World War. I would highly recommend, if possible, that you pursue further reading with that hallmark work by Fritz Fischer, Germany\\'s War Aims in the First World War (translated of course, from the original: Griff nach der Weltmacht: Die Kriegszielpolitik des kaiserlichen Deutschland 1914–1918). It was this publication which reignited the whole historiographical debate on what exactly the German Empire of 1914 wished to achieve when they issued that \"blank cheque\" to Austria-Hungary. With that recommendation and preamble aside, let\\'s begin. Prussia Ascends \"Mit einem Worte: wir wollen niemand in den Schatten stellen, aber wir verlangen auch unseren Platz an der Sonne.\" (in one word: We wish to throw no one into the shade, but we also demand our own place in the sun.).^ The quote above was made by Secretary of State of Foreign Affairs Bernhard von Bulow in December of 1897 to the German Reichstag (essentially their parliament). It echoes, in essence, the ultimate dream of Prussia (and then Germany) going into the 20th century. The German government was new to the game of Empires, and it believed that if Germany were to continue her rise as a continental and then global power, she required colonies of her own. This belief would soon become known as Weltpolitik (world politics), in which the German government deliberately sought to expand the influence of this new European power within and beyond the continent, in the hopes of becoming a new Weltmacht (world power). Historian Michael Howard on this pride in the imperialist system: It the German Empire had every reason to be ambitious. It constituted a nation over sixty million strong with a superb heritage of music, poetry, and philosophy, and whose scientists, technologists, and scholars (not to mention soldiers) were the envy of the world... The Germans prided themselves on a uniquely superior culture that held the balance between the despotic barbarism of their eastern neighbours and the decadent democracy of the West.\"^ To the Germans, their main rival (and obstacle) in this quest for world power was the British Empire, which at the time was the largest and possessed large influence all over the world. This \"British problem\" as I shall phrase it henceforth, would be a key contributor to the German aims in World War 1. The Imperium of Europe When the First World War began, the German High Command was still pondering the British problem. For the most part, they had left it to the Kaiserliche Marine (the German Empire\\'s Navy) to deal with the British threat. This of course entailed a naval confrontation somewhere in the North Sea or even the Channel, but the High Seas Fleet did not possess the perceived strength to take on the Royal Navy\\'s Grand Fleet based in Scapa Flow and later the Firth of Forth. German military planners for their part did not concern themselves too much with the threat of a British Expeditionary Force on the continent, but they did fear (as in the days of Napoleon) a prolonged war in which Britain\\'s impregnability as an island nation would be exploited to force a peace (something Germany was not willing to endure, as it had taxed Napoleon in his efforts a century ago). As the war dragged on and hopes of a swift victory were dashed, within the German Empire there were various camps forming with regards to German war aims. On the larger scale, we have the supporters of national self-sufficiency, and on the other side the imperialists of the Pan-German stamp. Historian Wolfgang J. Mommsen best describes what the first of these groups believed in: To the national self-sufficiency group, the true purpose of the war was the victorious defense of the German Reich against a world of enemies; hence their positive war aims were directed solely towards ensuring the security of the empire.^ Whereas a contemporary account in 1915 by theologian and philosopher Ernst Troeltsch, who himself was a member of the national self-sufficiency camp, best describes the stance of the imperialists: \"What a German victory should aim to achieve is the permanent enfeeblement of the great world powers on its borders, namely the British and Russian empires; this would also remove for ever the French threat to Germany. German world power must supplant replace these weakened empires.\"^ Even within the imperialist camp, also known as the \"annexationists\", there were divisions. The \"anti-imperialists\" such as Chancellor von Bethmann Hollweg, believed that a \"weak-kneed\" peace was ideal to avoid further German suffering, and the right-wing \"total annexationists\", who echoed the nationalist sentiments of Bulow and the other Prussian nobility by pushing for German confidence in taking territory everywhere it could. It was this unyielding commitment to expansion which doomed German peace efforts in 1915 with the Belgians and 1916 with the Dual Entente (Britain and France). What did the Germans want exactly with victory? A hard question to be sure, but Fischer believes that the German vision of a Mitteleuropa (Middle Europe) and Mittelafrika (Middle Africa) embody the main rhetoric of German war aims. They wished to create a Europe and Africa with Germany as the key nation-state in the former and influencer (and perhaps coloniser) in the latter.

       " 'Greetings! This response will cover in more-depth the geopolitical perceptions of the Russian Empire in the 19th century (specifically from about 1830 to 1899) and within that category focus more on how two key powers viewed Russia: Austria-Hungary and the British Empire. Note that parts of this response have been adapted from an earlier one on relations between Austria and Russia in the 1800s and I hope that other contributors can chime in on a wider variety of opinions about the Russian empire. Let\\'s begin. The Lion and the Bear British politicians for much of the 19th century viewed Imperial Russia as a constant threat from the east in the security of their Empire. Whilst Russia could do no harm militarily to the Home Islands (given her lack of naval technology and economic backwardness), they were most concerned about what Russian expansion eastward meant for the British Raj on the Indian subcontinent. In the 1820s Russia had begun expanding downwards into the Back Sea and into dangerous orbit with the Ottoman Empire (then referred to colloquially as the \"Sublime Porte\" after the main government offices in Constantinople). The British feared that the Ottoman Empire\\'s weakening grip over its Eastern European provinces in the Balkans and the open rebellion of its Arab regions (sparked after viceroy Mehmet Ali\\'s revolt in Egypt) would give Russia the means to expand further into the Levant and control Anatolia. This was an unacceptable eventuality, as that meant Russia would exert massive (if not the most) influence over Persia, the eastern Mediterranean, and directly threaten the Suez canal. Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston described these fears aptly in 1835: \"I take Tsar Nicholas I to be ambitious, bent upon great schemes, determined to make extensive additions to his dominions and, animated by the same hatred to England which was felt by Napoleon.\"^ Palmerston, echoing a fear shared by many of Britain\\'s imperial agents, feared that Russian encroachment into Central Asia would inevitably lead to conflict over the British Raj, threatening that \"jewel in the crown of the Empire\". To that end, the British sought to ensure that Russia\\'s influence in Central Asia was limited (or even rolled back) from places such as Afghanistan and Persia. As Palmerston himself rhetorically phrased it: \"Sooner or later, the Cossack and the Sepoy Indian soldier serving under Britain, the man from the Baltic and he from the British islands will meet in the centre of Asia. It should be our business to make sure that the meeting is as far off from our Indian possessions as may be convenient.\"^ With the Russian defeat at the hands of an Anglo-French-Turkish coalition in the Crimean War, this seemed a plausible route. The resulting series of geopolitical conflicts in Central Asia however, known as the Great Game, would cost Britain and Russia dearly. By 1870, London had to accept that St. Petersburg was not budging from its place in Asia, but also that it posed no dire or immediate threat to the security of the British Raj. The Roaring Bear and the Double-Sided Eagles Adapted from the earlier response linked in the introduction In 1853 we find the origins of the Crimean War as the first major upheaval in Austro-Hungarian-Russian relations and the decline of positive perceptions of Russia in Vienna. The occupation by Russia of the Danubian Principalities shortly after the debacle over the rights of Christians in the Holy Land sparked a series of negotiations between the powers of Europe. The Austro-Hungarian Empire was quick to react to the occupation in particular, joining with Britain and France in drafting the Vienna Note, which (without getting too far into its technicalities and interpretations), accepted the legitimate claims of Russia to the Ottoman-Christian territories, without overriding the authority of the Sultan. Tsar Nicholas I accepted this offer, but the Turks demanded certain changes which would have made the final Note unacceptable to the Russians. This diplomatic back-and-forth went on for a while, until the Western Powers were persuaded to (with the supposed backing of Austria-Hungary) issue an ultimatum that the Russian immediately leave the Danubian Principalities by April 30th, 1954. When the tsar made no reply and the Habsburg support turned out to be merely diplomatic rather than militarily, Britain and France declared war on March 27th. It is this \"big picture\" narrative of events that we must keep in mind, as we pick out the specifics of the Austro-Hungarian Empire\\'s role in the negotiations. The Habsburg monarchy was a critical consideration for the policy-makers in St. Petersburg, including the Tsar himself. To that end, Count Orlov (a prominent diplomat) was dispatched to Vienna in January 1854 in order to secure Austrian neutrality for the war which was predicted to come (the Russian minister in Berlin was ordered to do the same for the Prussians). So concerned with the intervention of Prussia and Austria-Hungary was Russia, that Orlov was authorised to guarantee the integrity of Austria-Hungary from French hostilities. Knowing full well that such negotiations would add another complex dimension to the overarching ones with Britain, France, and the Ottomans, a young Emperor Franz Joseph declined to talk about such matters. Both he and the Austrian Empire\\'s foreign minister Count Karl Ferdinand von Buol insisted instead that Russian troops not cross the Danube, for that would incite further reason for Austria to side with the Western Powers. Mind you, the Western Powers were also finding it rather difficult to deal with Vienna in their own diplomatic efforts. It would not be an overstatement to suggest that the opinion of the Austro-Hungarian Empire quite literally was the lynchpin of the entire negotiation process. This was particularly evident in the surprise of the Western Powers when Austrian support for the ultimatum turned out to be merely diplomatic in nature. Historian Bernadotte E. Schmitt writing in 1919 about this concern notes: \"They presented their ultimatum for the evacuation of the Principalities on the understanding that Austria would support it, whereas she actually gave only diplomatic approval, not a promise of military assistance, which alone would have compelled Russia to yield.\"^ The difficulty for the Austrians was considerable. The memory of Russia\\'s intervention (and specifically that of Tsar Nicholas I) during the Crisis of 1848 remained in the minds of both Emperor Franz Joseph (who came to power largely in part thanks to Russian assistance) and top-level advisors across the Empire. However, all of them also feared that if Russia maintained dominance in the Danubian Principalities, she would set up vassal states whose Slavic majorities would lead to further complications with the Slavic populations living under the Dual Monarchy. On the other hand, these leaders were also reluctant to cooperate with Britain or France in their opposition to Russia. The former was viewed as the home of liberalism and the home-in-exile of Hungarian lawyer Lajos Kossuth, who had played a considerable part in the 1848-9 revolution. The latter, ruled by Napoleon III, was viewed as the champion of Italian independence, which upset Austro-Hungarian rule in the region. In the end, Austria became increasingly hostile towards her old ally in the east. After Count Orlov admitted that Russia would indeed set up vassal states in the Balkans, the Emperor insisted that they now only conduct military campaigns on the Asiatic side of the Ottoman Empire (an impossibility given that the main crux of hostilities lay in Eastern Europe). Even as the Russian troops crossed the Danube on March 22nd, the Austrians were reluctant to place their army on high-alert. Just before Austrian troops were put on high-alert and the Russian crossed the Danube, the Habsburg Monarchy managed to secure an alliance with the Prussians. This alliance never had to wield its guns in the Crimean War, but it did set a precedent of thinking in Vienna which would characterise the next several decades of Russian antagonism by the Austro-Hungarians.',\n",
       " 'The idea that the Famine was a genocide is entirely rejected by historians of Ireland, yet still persists in the popular imagination - akin to the Irish Slaves Myth. This perception is the result of several factors, but primarily the nationalist (and anti-British) narrative received from nineteenth- and early twentieth-century historians and authors, such as John Mitchel. He famously stated in his 1873 book The Last Conquest of Ireland (Perhaps) that \"the Almighty, indeed, sent the potato blight, but the English created the Famine”, initiating the genocide theory. It’s this legacy of the Famine and its role as a defining nationalist moment, rather than the actual historical record, that has led to this narrative. This could partly be owing to a lack of historical engagement until the 1990s and the lag between academic findings and public perception. In addition, it\\'s important to note that the definition of genocide has changed since the nineteenth century and Mitchel’s writing; it now has a very different meaning in the context of the Holocaust and WWII. There’s a lot to unpack when it comes to the Famine and its legacy so here\\'s some context: There had been a succession of smaller famines in Ireland from the 17th century onwards, but the Great Famine, or An Gorta Mór (and not the Potato Famine), was much, much worse and, in the words of Cormac Ó Gráda, was the product of an ecological disaster. It occurred between 1845 and 1852, a period in which approximately 1 million people died (mostly of typhus and diseases linked to starvation) and another million or so emigrated to the US and Britain. The population declined from 8.2 million in 1841 to 6.5 million in 1851 . By 1914, the population of the island of Ireland was c.4.5 million, half of what it had been in 1845, and it then stagnated for much of the 20th century. In the period 1845-55 alone, Timothy Meagher estimates that 1.5 million Irish went to America . Descriptions in contemporary newspapers and the responses to the National Folklore Collection’s (in UCD 1945 questionnaire on the Famine are harrowing; it had genuine negative psychological effects on the Irish population and should still be seen as the central event in modern Irish history. In terms of apportioning blame, the claims of genocide stem from the inefficient government response. The Prime Minister, Peel, was slow to initiate relief in 1845 (because short famines were not uncommon): when he eventually took action it was to import grain from North America rather than to stop exporting food from Ireland - this is a major point of controversy as there was food in Ireland during the famine years, but nobody could have it. He also established public relief works, where people would work for money, e.g. building roads, to buy food. Then in 1846, the Liberal Lord Russell was elected PM; the Liberals’ core ideology was laissez-faire - where the state should not interfere with the economy and society. Their response to the famine was therefore conditioned by this ideology and they simply let the free market take its course. As the crisis deepened, some measures were undertaken by Lord Russell but they proved inadequate. The public relief works were deemed a failure by January 1847 as people were too weak to work; the soup kitchens, established in February 1847, were a very effective response but they were brought to a close in October 1847 because the Government assumed the famine was over and because they didn’t want to spend the money; workhouses were provided under the Poor Law but were overcrowded; and private charity existed but it was no substitute for government relief, especially for the length of time the famine continued. At the time, the contemporary press reported that the government was not taking enough action but the blaming and claims of genocide only truly began in the 1870s with the emergence of the Land War. Actions taken by landlords during the famine - namely evictions and consolidation of land - caused extreme bitterness and were central to the Land War. The famine thus helped lay the foundation for the struggle for national independence. It also became the origin myth for Irish Catholics in America - a group who resented the British government and who played a central role in Irish nationalist politics. The government response was ineffective, clearly, but the famine was not engineered by the British. It happened as a result of blight, it disproportionately affected the poorer Irish owing to their reliance on the potato, and the response was negligent and grossly mismanaged; there is no evidence that there was intent on the part of the British government to kill the Irish. But claims of genocide suited the nationalist narrative. NOTES: Mary E. Daly, ‘Famines and Famine Relief, 1740-2000’, in Eugenio F. Biagini and Mary E.

       " 'The common scholarly consensus is that the Great Famine in Ireland was not a genocide, but with qualifiers. Cormac O\\'Grada\\'s The Great Irish Famine is one of the more reliable and prominent modern sources (and typically assigned in courses on Irish history that cover the famine) and O\\'Grada argues that the British response to the famine cannot be properly construed as genocidal as there is no apparent intent to outright exterminate the Irish population. However O\\'Grada does note that this does not support the opposite position of the famine being entirely natural either. His research with Vanhaute and Paping demonstrates that the level of crop failure caused by the potato blight was worst in Ireland, and not helped by the comparative over-reliance on potatoes in Ireland compared to elsewhere, but even with these notes the death toll is far greater than seen in Prussia or the Netherlands during the famine (and both Prussia and the Netherlands had severe failures of their principal grain crops during this time as well). Other demographic data aside from deaths suggest that Ireland was hit worse but not so uniquely worse as to explain alone why the mass migrations and high mortality rate were seen in Ireland but not the European mainland. And the primary sources we have indicate that there was a belief among relevant government actors that the response was insufficient and intentionally so: Charles Trevelyan, who was put in charge of directing the response, wrote privately on the famine that \"the cure has been applied by the direct stroke of an all-wise Providence in a manner,\" and others in the government spoke both critically of an insufficient response and positively in stating that the famine was eliminating what was viewed as a \"surplus population\" or overpopulation in Ireland. The view among most historians came down to the British response to the famine being focused more on the British Empire than the welfare of the Irish and the massive casualty rate being not an act of deliberate genocide but rather a use of the deaths to put in place policies that would have been impossible in the face of local opposition, but it is not accurate to say either that the famine was entirely a product of British policies nor that the famine was some act of God that the British were entirely blameless for.

       " 'Zoroastrian scripture can be broadly divided into three categories, based on the language they are written in, two of which I think it\\'s fair to divide into subcategories: Old Avestan Gathas All Other Old Avestan Younger Avestan Middle Persian Sassanid works Later works The word \"Avesta\" identifies basically every surviving work composed in any stage or dialect of the Avestan language. Avestan can be divided into the two categories I identified above: Old and Younger. They are loosely comparable to Middle English and Modern English in terms of how different they are, though the nature of those differences is very different. The Gathas are specifically the oldest section of the Avesta attributed to the prophet Zarathustra himself. Additional religious texts composed under the Sassanid Persian Empire and later are also often included in the corpus Zoroastrian scripture, and modern Zoroastrians debate how heavily those later works ought to factor into their beliefs. Thanks to almost 250 years of work in comparative historical linguistics the vast majority of scholars have reached a consensus on the age of the Gathas, which is then used to identify a range of dates for the rest of the Avesta. Languages tend to change in predictable ways at predictable rates over time. By comparing Old Avestan to other Iranian languages and to its closest linguistic relative, Sanskrit (and its descendant languages), linguists now place the Gathas c. 1200-1000 BCE, used in the region around the intersection of Uzebekistan, Tajikstan, Turkmenistan, and Afghanistan. This necessarily places the lifetime of Zarathustra in the same time period and place. The rest of the Old Avestan corpus is very small, comprised only of the Yasna Haptanghaiti and components of the Five Sacred Prayers woven in and around the Gathas during the Yasna, the Zoroastrian liturgical ceremony. Based on the linguistic change between the Gathas and the Prayers, Zarathustra seems to have lived at the tail end of Old Avestan history, and Younger Avestan developed within a few generations. By about 900 BCE, Younger Avestan had probably completely replaced Old Avestan in regular use. Based on the place names used in both Younger Avestan and later Zoroastrian/Iranian traditions, the speakers of Younger Avestan also spread south into modern Afghanistan and eastern Iran (the ancient province of Arachosia). Younger Avestan thus accounts for most of the Avesta as we know it today and was probably in use down to about 400 BCE, at which point the Avestan language seems to have died out. It\\'s entirely possible that a descendant language survived beyond this period, but with the rise of the Achaemenid Empire, the core of Zoroastrian development began to drift westward to reflect the newly formed power of the Persians. As a result, later Zoroastrian literature would be composed in Persian. This is where academic research and Zoroastrian/Iranian traditions begin to hit a snag. Modern consensus about the lifetime of Zarathustra has largely supplanted the ancient Sassanid and Roman misconceptions that the prophet lived around the 7th century BCE, but it hasn\\'t been as successful in creating a common religious and secular academic consensus when all of this was written down. The whole Avestan corpus was preserved as oral tradition for centuries. Each generation of priests would memorize the words and meter of the hymns and prayers verbatim and pass them on. Linguists think this was actually pretty successful, given how these verses survive today. Beginning in the late Sassanid period, there is evidence of a tradition that believed Alexander of Macedon destroyed vast quantities of Zoroastrian knowledge when he conquered Persia, burning holy books stored in Persepolis and massacring the Magi, priests who would have passed on knowledge orally. There is no evidence for this. There is absolutely no record of writing or scribes associated with temples from the Achaemenid period, and while Alexander is supposed to have murdered priests in India according to Quintus Curtius Rufus, no mention is made of similar events in Iran. It\\'s very probable that some establishment priests perished during Alexander\\'s conquests and that whole lines of hereditary Magi may have been lost, but nothing as targeted as later tradition states. Likewise, absolutely no evidence or reference to written Zoroastrian religious documents appears during the Seleucid or Arsacid periods in the following centuries. There are even some references in Middle Persian literature that imply writing may have been considered a product of the Druj (the cosmic concept of lies and disorder) and Ahriman (the god that champions Druj), and therefore it was unfit for holy words. This changed in the 4th century CE, most likely under King Shapur II, when a unique script was developed specifically to write Avestan and the Avesta was compiled as a text for the first time. This began a manuscript tradition of copying and recopying the text in the newfound Avestan script, which is still used for writing the scriptures in the original Avestan today, though transliteration in the Latin alphabet is also common in modern scholarship. The Sassanids also produced commentaries and supplements to the Avesta in their native Middle Persian language. The vast majority of this was lost in the immediate wake of the Arab conquest of Iran in the 7th century, and may be the basis for some later allegorical traditions of Alexander destroying Achaemenid texts. A few late Sassanid Middle Persian works do survive, like the Zaratosht-nama and Ayadgar-i Zariran - both epic poems - as well as sections of the the Arda Wiraz namag, a dream narrative about the afterlife, and the Denkard, a sort of religious encyclopedia. Middle Persian continued to act as the literary language of the Zoroastrian communities into the 10th century CE, and many well known pieces of Zoroastrian literature were produced in the early medieval period. Examples include the rest of the Denkard, and most famously: the Bundahishn, a codification of medieval Zoroastrian cosmology and mythology. Finally, if you\\'re at all familiar with the preservation of ancient sources, then you know that it is very rare for large ancient manuscripts to survive in most environments, particularly under hostile political circumstances. The same is true of all of the texts we\\'ve discussed today. Almost no original Sassanid writing survives. Instead we are left to deal exclusively with fragments and summaries of other works until the 14th century CE. The oldest extant manuscript of the complete Avesta as we know it today is the K1 Manuscript, dated to 1323. K1 is the basis for almost all modern translation of the Avesta. The oldest surviving Middle Persian codex (labeled \"MK\") is dated to 1322 and is the the primary manuscript for translating many Middle Persian texts. In other cases the oldest surviving copies are even younger. For example, the oldest copy of the Bundahishn is dated to 1540. This is a relatively poor survival rate for surviving ancient manuscripts in comparison to more popular works like Biblical texts or the most popular Greek histories and myths. That said, surviving at all means they did better than most, especially considering that the Gathas are essentially a Bronze Age oral tradition. This less impressive survival is also to be expected from texts that primarily circulated among the priesthood of a religious minority in central Iran and northern India, neither of which are conducive to preserving perishable documents.

In pre-modern ages, it is natural in the management of a such a massive political entity as the Ming that things are bound to be not uniform. Tha Ming had millions in terms of manpower, and those were recruited from different sources in different contexts.(according to their regional laws, and such). As a result only some would be armed with arquebuses, if they had, while others would only have extremely primitive firearms. Also the Ming muskets were notorious for their unsatisfactory manufacture quality. In Qi Ji Guang’s manual, it was said that soldiers were afraid of aiming, because the muskets may easily blow up. While those ideas were overblown, this, alongside the previous point made creating entire cohesive units of trained musketeers extremely hard and inconvenient when they had already the upper hand in manpower and most importantly, artillery.',\n",
       " 'The era that correlates to the Islamic \"Golden Age\" was a pretty important one in terms of interreligious relations across Europe, the Mediterranean, and the wider Muslim world. While most Christian scholars outside of the Arabic world did not have much Quranic proficiency until late in the Middle Ages (as late as the twelfth of thirteen even in the Greek world, according to R. Y. Ebied and David Thomas), criticism of Christianity and Judaism was baked into the foundations of Islam. Depictions of Christian and Jewish stories appear in the Quran and other early Islamic literatures. You might have heard that Mary is the woman mentioned most frequently in its text-- the Quran largely agrees with Christian depictions of the life of Jesus, although it doesn\\'t agree with the orthodox Christian belief in Jesus\\'s divinity. From the earliest period there seems to at least be an understanding of Jewish and Christian narratives among the religion-crafters, if not necessarily familiarity with the texts itself (although that still existed primarily among scholars). In other cases, Muslim scholars argued that Jewish and Christian scriptures had been falsified to remove accurate depiction of the \"true\" religion, which they claimed was the Islam that Muhammad delivered. This is known as tahrif. Two particular targets of tahrif accusations are Ezra, a Jewish scribe whose Books in the Bible depict the end of the Exile and the construction of the Second Temple, and Paul, whose interpretation of Christianity is now the dominant one. Both were accused of altering the correct narrative to introduce blasphemous or heretical beliefs. Ibn Hazm was one of the major scholars of this theory, who argued that verses like Genesis 3:22 (\"This man has become like one of us\") are evidence of corruption in favour of polytheism. These verses have other interpretations among other groups, such as the Royal We, a heavenly council comprised of God and the angels, the Trinity, etc., etc., but the simplest explanation might be that the original text was composed in a time when outright monotheism (as opposed to preferential worship, called henotheism) was either developing or had not yet entered into the Hebrew religion. Paul is accused of having deified Jesus and that his interpretations of the religion were the foundation for modern Christian mistakes. Frankly, these accusations in particular are probably mostly true-- Paul\\'s letters form a disproportionate amount of the Christian canon and are a significant part of the foundations for the religion\\'s day to day practices. Having developed after both Judaism and Christianity, Islam benefited from their existing history of criticism between themselves. Jewish accusations of Christian polytheism through the Trinity and Christian accusations that Jews had killed Jesus, who Muslims see as the legitimate Messiah, were echoed by Muslims. Another way of gaining insight into its predecessor religion was through conversion. Converts play a disproportionately large role in the field of polemics (interreligious criticism). These converts specifically tended to be upper-class or well-educated members of their original religion who came into contact with other religions through study or cosmopolitan relations. For Islam, particular examples include Samaw\\'al al-Maghribi, a former Jew who converted to Islam, and Abd Allah al-Turjuman, a former Christian priest. These converts were able to bring specific insights into their original religion and criticize them as if from within. One writer, Abd al-Haqq al-Islami, agreed with the Muslim claim that Jewish scriptures had been falsified. References: R. Y.

He sent a telegram to the Führerbunker saying that if he didn\\'t hear otherwise from Hitler by 10 PM of April 24th, he\\'d assume Hitler was incapacitated and invoke the law. Hitler was furious, his anger stoked by Party Chancellery leader Martin Bormann, and sent a reply the next day demanding that Göring resign; he was placed under house arrest by the SS shortly after. Meanwhile, Heinrich Himmler had entered into clandestine negotiations through Count Folke Bernadotte (nephew of the King of Sweden), claiming that he had provisional leadership power to negotiate terms of surrender. He even used the liberation of concentration camp prisoners to buy himself goodwill with the western Allies. Unsurprisingly, Hitler was furious again, denouncing it as the \"most shameful betrayal in human history.\" He ordered Himmler arrested, and had the highest-ranking SS subordinate—Hermann Fegelein, Eva Braun\\'s brother-in-law who had previously tried to escape the Führerbunker in civilian clothes—executed.

Bormann would remain in his role in the Party Chancellery. The will notably contained a clause that officially stripped Goering of all his ranks and expelled him from the Nazi Party.

Roman aristocrats wanted to get the value for their money, so if one built a temple on their own expense, they were sure to put their name on that temple. Prominent Romans could have statues, and of course they also had descendants. These descendants and relatives were sure to boast of the deeds of their forefathers. They would try to put their faces on money, and it was customary to have busts of their ancestors at home. So a proper Roman aristocrat would know the names and faces of their ancestors, and the older generations would teach them their legacy of course. Vorenus has probably served with many aristocrats. IRL Lucius Vorenus is mentioned as a high ranking centurion of the IXth legion under Quintus Cicero, so I imagine he would have been on first name basis with Cicero at least. (He was the brother of Marcus Tullius Cicero by the way.) And of course there were other public records that the magistrates would make, and there were historians who have written books leaning on these sources. The first of them was Fabius Pictor in the III. century, so by the time Vorenus was born there was quite a selection of historians to choose from. But I have to add that Lucius Vorenus is not your average Roman Joe. As said, IRL he was a high-ranking centurion who probably came from a knightly family or became a knight during his life at some point (since the census was based on wealth and Caesar\\'s campaigns in Gaul were lucrative), and in the series he is also shown as a reasonably wealthy and influential member of Roman society. For reading more I would recommend Tim Cornell\\'s The Beginnings of Rome, he has a whole chapter dedicated to the sources that might have been available for the historians that we use as sources. Edit: Of course the Cicerones were homini noves in the sense that Marcus was the first of the family to become a senator. But they were still very much part of the Roman/Italian aristocracy, a wealthy family of high status. They just did not live in the capital, but in the smaller Arpinum. Much like Maecenas could be said a \"new man\", while he was the descendant of an ancient Etruscan dynasty that has ruled his hometown for centuries.',\n",
       " \"Could I ask you to clarify precisely what you mean? I know the passenger service world, not the freight world, so I'll stick to that. A great many designs have changed, for a great many reasons. Sometimes it has to do with safety. For example, the flared out, upside-down smokestack archetypal of our view of an Old West steam engine is really only necessary for wood burning trains (More common than you'd expect. Freight isn't my thing, but I can tell you logging railroads heavily used wood burning locomotives even when most railroads had coal, because why pay to ship coal out into the logging camps when you've got plenty of timber you can use? Coal may be better fuel, but the wood is basically free to loggers compared to the cost of transporting coal), coal burners having a straight pipe. The cone is a spark catcher to prevent fires, which is really only an issue for burning wood. Passenger cars become heavier as time goes on partially as an issue of comfort (less rattling and rocking around, and you can start making luxurious Pullman interiors), and partially as an issue of safety (lightweight wooden cars have basically no durability in a crash, and casualties could be very high). Of course, with more passengers as incomes rise and people can buy tickets, and the population overall increases and people spread out further, well, you need bigger locomotives, especially with these heavier Pullman cars, and early 20th Century steam locomotives are bigger, bulkier, and more utilitarian. &#x200B; Then coming into the 20s and 30s we're learning more about aerodynamics and how we can streamline a train to get it to go faster, and you start seeing those really curvy shapes, with hidden smokestacks, and those fairings on the sides of the engine. You also start seeing diesels crop up, and America really gets into diesels with streamlined trains. Very smooth and sleek, meant to go fast, the same basic models can do both passenger and freight. And from here, things really diverge, to where American trains just have a specific look to them, that you don't see in Europe, and I do not know European trains, so I'm useless to say why German trains look like German trains look. America got the EMD E and F units (F3 and F7 being the more well known), which is basically the image of a diesel train in America to this day. I can say in America, as our passenger railroads collapsed and Amtrak nationalized passenger service, those streamlined diesels were old and falling apart, and Amtrak needed a new locomotive, and the main manufacturer was only really doing freight, so Amtrak got basically a retooled freight design. Especially because the manufacturer thought Amtrak would fail, and wanted to sell Amtrak something that could be repurposed for freight if Amtrak did indeed fail. So Amtrak got that truck design with the elongated cab that's common to this day in the US. The EMD SDP40F. &#x200B; Honestly, I can't tell you what's up with that kinda semi-truckish shape, as compared to a flat cab. Freight is, again, not my thing. I just know why Amtrak ended up with basically freight locomotives. And they didn't work well for a bunch of unimportant reasons to this story, so EMD made a new design, the F40PF, which still looks like a semi-truck, and despite still being basically a freight design, it's beloved, it served well, I like them, Amtrak sold them off as they aged, and many regional railroads, such as the Caltrain I ride frequently, still have them today (though we are getting ready to retire them). Now the trend is back towards streamliners, because it's clear passenger rail isn't failing and we can afford passenger rail locomotives, and, well, streamlining is just better. It's aerodynamic. &#x200B; That said, this isn't really a great answer, because I need more to go off of. I'm just sort of shooting off some basic, surface level examples of changes that have happened over time. Do you want to know more about those Pullman cars, and how those developed into lighter weight cars for streamliners despite more weight originally being desirable? About how a lot of American rail shifted over to two level passenger cars as opposed to one level? Why streamliners went away for so long? Why freight has influenced American passenger rail design for a while? How Amtrak has searched for new locomotive designs? In order to answer the original prompt, I need to know what about the traditional 1800s trains you've seen change, so I can look into why that may have been.\",\n",
       " 'It varied from person to person and from family to family, but we can categorise these conversos into different groups. Those who converted sincerely and renounced Judaism for good. Things did not change that much for them, especially if they already came from positions of power. Abraham Seneor was a very rich jew who frequently lent money to the Crown of Castille, and who was quite a regular of the Royal Court, in part by virtue of being somehow related to Andrés Cabrera marquess of Moya. Abraham was forced to convert, and convert he did. He was dismissed from his position as \"alcabalero mayor de Segovia\" (chief tax officer of Segovia), but within a year he was back in the saddle under his new name: Fernán Núñez Coronel. He became the genearch of the very rich and influential Coronel lineage in Segovia. There are plenty of instances of people like Seneor, especially in Burgos, where two thirds of the rich merchants were jews or recent conversos, including lineages like Santa Cruz, Salamanca, Osorio, and Cartagena. Then we have those who converted sincerely, but upon whom there was a looming suspicion of false conversion. Depending on the places, suspicions could lead to shunning, denounces, or violence. The Cartagena lineage from Burgos was among this category. There were suspicions of false conversion, and the Cartagenas had to defend their sincere conversion, to the point of them writing a pamphlet for emperor Charles V where they defended converso soldiers and military officers as far more chivalrous and meritorious than their \"old christian\" counterparts as they actually took the effort in learning the tenets of Christianity and chivalry, instead of having christianity since and early eage. This group of conversos was quite endangered, especially if suspicions of their conversions became vox populi, as they would be shunned, and risked being lynched by angry mobs. Lives were ruined by such things, as foreseen in the question asked. A third group is those who publicly converted by kept practising judaism in secrecy. This kind of conversos was the fundamental target of the ires and actions of the Inquisition, an institution dealing against \"crimes of heretic pravity and apostasy\". The punishment would be different depending on the proven facts against the accused, and whether it was a first time offense or was it repeated. The Inquisition tended to be lenient to first time offenders, imposing abjurations de levi. If there was reincidence, then an abjuration de vehementi would be imposed along with public pennance and a pecuniary fine. More repeat offenders would get heftier fines, or even death and confiscation of properties. The Inquisition actually preferred to just impose pecuniary fines, as those would help in running the courts, paying the public defendants, paying the civil servants on the Inquisition\\'s payrols, etc. Of all these groups, the vast majority would be on the second category, but time would just shift them onto the first one. The false conversos were never a huge number of people, but neither had been the jews for that matter.',\n",
       " 'It isn\\'t true. The early Middle Ages are still sometimes called the Dark Ages, for either of two reasons. The original of the term was to represent the perceived intellectual \"darkness\" of the time. This is the original Renaissance meaning of the term, glorifying both the Renaissance and ancient Rome and Greece by damning the Middle Ages between them. The two most common modern uses, in \"serious history\", are: 1. A time where there is a lack of surviving written sources, compared to before and after. 2. A time of crisis, transition, and/or collapse. The term has been used to mean the disruption of long-distance trade, the collapse of centralised government, decline in agricultural systems (possibly due to climate change), etc. These uses are less common today than before, but it isn\\'t due to political correctness, but more due to the term being easily misunderstood (as meaning something like the original Renaissance meaning). Why use an ambiguous term that is easily misunderstood? Martin talks about life being harder, and \"certainly a lot less pleasant than it had been during the Roman era\" which had had \"better government\" and \"better hygiene\". Most people in the Roman Empire were close-to-subsistence farmers, most people in the early Middle Ages were close-to-subsistence farmers, most people in the late Middle Ages were close-to-subsistence farmers, and most people in Early Modern times were close-to-subsistence farmers. Medieval agriculture was generally improved over Roman agriculture, and people didn\\'t eat worse on average. They didn\\'t suffer more plagues on average in the early Middle Ages, and perhaps fewer. They married, they raised families, they paid taxes, and they bathed. What difference would the disappearance of the highest level of government had made for a farmer? Smaller government and a smaller urban elite might well have resulted in lower taxes, hardly something that would make their life harder. The rise of Absolutism as a principle of government in Europe after the Middle Ages was not something that the typical farmer would have seen as a Good Thing. Science didn\\'t stop in the \"Dark Ages\". Technology continued to advance, agriculture continued to advance. Literature didn\\'t stop. In some places and times, the main focus of literature moved from written to oral, but literature itself continued. If we resort to very simple quantitative measures as a proxy for the quality of life, we might try life expectancy. As far as we can tell, \"Dark Ages\" life expectancies were not lower than Roman life expectancies, and possibly somewhat higher. As noted above, the \"Dark Ages\" was meant to glorify ancient Greek and Rome, and the supposed rebirth (i.e., renaissance) of their heritage in the Renaissance. But life in neither antiquity nor the Renaissance was glorious paradise, especially for the average farmer, and even less so for slaves (Martin himself discusses some of these issues: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X_0PSvGhvc for example.) If, in terms of how hard life was for the average person, science and literature, and life expectancy, the \"Dark Ages\" was no worse than what came before and after, what was so \"dark\" about it?',\n",
       " '/u/wotan_weevil has covered the substantial aspects of the question already, but there is one ancillary issue here which should be addressed. As I have discussed in detail before the shift away from calling the Middle Ages, either in whole or part, a Dark Age took place between the 1910s-20s. (Well at least among educated anglophone authors. There are comparable developments in other languages around the same time, but this terminology of \"the Dark Ages\" is mostly unique to English.) So to frame this development in terms of this modern culture-war terminology of political correctness – well it\\'s a bit dated now, but certainly no earlier than the 1970s – is simply anachronistic.',\n",

       " 'Fencing was a widespread cultural activity with participants of nearly every class in nearly every culture in Western Europe during the medieval period. While it was obviously an element of warfare, swords were generally considered secondary to a polearm - like a lance or halberd or pike, or crossbow or musket - among different classes of fighting men, from professional mercenaries to fighting noblemen to civic militias. All of these men would find the question of what fencing was for very odd: fencing was fencing. It was a thing you did for itself, just like singing or dancing. Fencing is fun, and it was regarded as such even as far back as the 13th century. An advice book written in 1275 lists fencing, along with riding practice and lance practice, as an \"amusement\" among the king\\'s guardsmen. Pietro Monte, a 15th century master at arms, similarly describes fencing along with a diversity of other physical activities for men of arms to practice. Other advice books have a remarkably consistent list of activities for the physical education of the youth that include dancing, wrestling, leaping or vaulting, swimming, climbing, riding and jousting, shooting, climbing, and fencing. For example, Jörg Wilhalm Hutter, an early 16th century fencing treatise author and Augsburg hatter, wrote the following: Throwing stones, shoving staves, fencing and wrestling, dancing and jumping, jousting and tourneying, with these should one curry favor with women, yet fencing also wants pranking and jesting. This is presented in most of these books as amusements in their own right, but also as a means of training the body and acclimating the mind to stress and endurance for, among other things, warfare. I talk a bit more about athletic amusements here. But fencing is also unambiguously a part of tournament culture, both among the nobility and the lower classes. There were, without exaggeration, dozens of different kinds of tournaments and competitions, and even if we were to limit ourselves to one place and one decade, there would still be a huge variety in the ways that men competed and the ways that men played. For the purpose of this question, foot combats and melees often involved fencing with blunted swords or clubs, and certain kinds of single combats might involve numbered passes against one another with lance, sword, pollax, and daggers - but the variations in single combats for friendly competition or for other purposes is far far too complicated to really dive into here. So to bring this to a conclusion: fencing is of course an element of athletic culture in the medieval period, and is a part of the culture of play among classes high and low. It was viewed as an \"amusement\" in its own right and as a good exercise to boot. Fencing is also of course an element in warfare, as writers of fencing treatises themselves also discuss. For instance, Joachim Meyer, a cutler from Strassburg, wrote in 1570 that military leaders among all nations have so earnestly kept the troops they commanded in this practice, that sometimes when they would lie idle before the enemy, they would personally teach their soldiers how to handle their armour, weapons, and arms advantageously, and also skillfully to bear off the enemy\\'s strokes and thrusts, and to place their own correctly, which is particularly documented concerning Hannibal and the art of fencing is a particular element of the practice of war, and through this practice, the student is very masterfully stimulated to greater reflection to use every kind of advantage, along with many more other uses that this practice brings with it. It is likewise with the fact that single combat is a fine image in miniature of how a war leader should conduct himself against the enemy Meyer is not a lone genius here, as the connection between fencing and warfare is quite evident, but Meyer was also a patron of an activity called a Fechtschule or a fencing festival. They were competitions among Burghers to compete in non-lethal fencing games in single fencing bouts, the winner of each being the man who struck their opponent a bleeding wound on the crown of the head with a blunted special-purpose fencing sword, which is called today a Federschwert. The Burgher class itself was no stranger to military duty, either; they were expected to function as town watchmen, firefighters, and to fight battles in defense of the city if called upon So Meyer\\'s purpose, like all other fencing treatises, is to teach the serious and useful martial practice of war and also an activity people could engage in for fun, and money (winners also received two gulden per victory, about a week\\'s wages on average, which I expand on in this old answer if you\\'re interested), and for class clout, fame, honor, and glory. The Fechtschule deliberately modeled itself on the games of the nobility, who also prized public performance of skill as a useful skill and worthy practice and not only because these skills were related to warfare. Meyer\\'s position as the master at arms for the Duke of Mecklenberg, Johann-Albrecht I, just prior to his death also lets us see that this skill transcended class: if a burgher was considered skilled enough to teach warlike skills to the nobility, there couldn\\'t have been much difference in their approach. Ultimately, I think the main takeaway is that fencing is fencing. It was likely most often done because it\\'s fun, and as part of an athletic culture that encouraged private practice and public performance it was considered important, and connected not only to high-profile public demonstration, but also to warfare and fencing in private quarrels or duels. ________ You can read a translation of the 1275 manuscript The King\\'s Mirror here Pietro Monte\\'s Collectanea, Translated by Jeffrey Forgeng Jörg Wilhalm Hutter The Art of Combat, by Joachim Meyer, translated by Jeffrey Forgeng The Martial Ethic of Early Modern Germany, B.

       " 'I seem to read multiple questions here. First, how accurate these modern HEMA fencers are? I am not a practitioner, but I have followed the scene for about 10 years now. The answer, as you can guess, is \"it depends\". All I can say is that the most serious clubs are as accurate as one can reasonably get. I say so because they make a point of exclusively studying original Late Medieval and Early Modern fencing treatises, a great many of which luckily survived to this day. There is plenty of room for interpretation, naturally enough, so I could not swear any of them are 100% accurate. You also asked whether fencing was practised as a sport. The answer to this one is yes, definitely, at least in some times and places. Beyond various forms of tournaments, which often involved some swordfighting, XVI century Southern Germany had Fechtschulen (fencing schools) which, counterintuitively, were not schools but rather fencing competitions. Partecipation was open to townspeople, who also made up the bulk of the two main corporation of fencing masters (St. Mark\\'s Brothers and Feather Fencers). On fencing treatises: Sydney Anglo 2000.

       " 'There\\'s always more than can be said about his specific name and family history, but I wrote an answer on the German immigrant experience in schools that gets at some of what you\\'re asking. The full answer is here but the part I think might be most relevant for your question is about the shifting nature of whiteness in America and geographical differences: It should be said World War I, and tensions before the war, negatively impacted the dynamic between German Americans and their neighbors. Indiana and Texas, for example, had been a welcome place for German immigrants, including mandated German instruction in most Indiana high schools as a way to explicitly draw German immigrants to the state. (Basically, they were saying, \"your child will do well in at least one class in school and we\\'re cool with them speaking German.\" In 1900, more than 200 American public schools in more than a dozen states used this approach to appeal to German immigrants.) Steps, though, by xenophobic Americans brought a swift halt to German language and cultural education. Many of the men advocating for an end to anything and everything German in schools were engaged in what can best be described as \"superpatriotism.\" They saw it as their responsibility to rid their schools of any vestiges of the enemy, even though they had lived side by side with German immigrants for generations. But again, it was location dependant; New York State offered German language high school courses and corresponding exit exams until well into the modern era. Generally speaking, the pushback against Prussia in American schools during and after World War I was a general prejudice against all things German. A great deal of this was tied up in how white Americans have set and shifted the boundaries around who counted as white. That is, German Americans weren\\'t kicked out of the tent of whiteness - German speaking children were still allowed to attend public schools and German speaking adults were paid the same as other workers, whereas Black Americans were still barred from schools and paid less. So, while a German immigrant in the 1920\\'s and 1930\\'s may have felt the impact of nativism and xenophobia and elected to minimize the things that would draw attention, it would have been a matter of choice. The sentiment of the xenophobia would shift from German culture in general to German American children in specific by World War II. As an example, the topic of \"disordered\" thinking of American children raised in households speaking in German was a popular topic for dissertations well into the 1950\\'s. I\\'m also going to leave a link here to a question about the \"Americanization\" process for immigrants, including some history about the (not exactly accurate) idea immigrants were forced to change or Americanize their name when arriving at Ellis Island or other immigration points.',\n",

Studying transatlantic travel, where common women had virtually no access to luggage or storage, so they wore the same clothes and for as long as three months. This obviously proved difficult and particularly so for their monthly cycle as they didn\\'t have ready access to the top deck, let alone laundry facilities.

       " \"The information we have about Claudius' health is mostly derived from the description Suetnoius gives of him. In his book about the 12 Caesars, he always has a section of their physical attributes and health, such as he knew them. But also, keep in mind that Claudius reigned from 41-54 CE, and Suetonius was born probably at least 15 years after this, but he is a historian that lives closest so Claudius' lifetime. His account is likely based upon things that were said about Claudius after his death, or on whatever records were available to Suetnoius. He makes some strange claims about the physicality of other emperors, like Tiberius being able to push a finger through a ripe apple, because his joints were strong. Historians have varied greatly in their diagnosis of Claudius over the years. Polio, CP, tourettes etc. Most of these diagnoses are inaccurate, medically. This is what Suetonius actually says about his health: His knees were weak and his head was shaky. His speech was poor and he stammered. His mouth would foam and his nose would run, as well. Suetnoius describes that these symptoms would worsen when stressed. However, Suetnoius also writes that when sitting or lying down, he looked quite dignified. He was tall, but not slim. Later on he is describes as quite forgetful and aloof. Seneca (who was alive during the reign of Claudius) and Dio also attests to some of these symptoms. However, Suetnoius then goes on to say that while his health was poor, it became excellent when he was emperor, aside from fits of heartburn. Suetonius also writes that Claudius claimed to have exaggerated his ailments under Caligula (the prevoius emperor), to protect his own life. Claudius never planned on becoming emperor. Caligula was murdered, and then Claudius was chosen when he was 50 by soldiers, and was (apparently) hiding behind a curtain when a soldier came upon him and hailed him as emperor. Due to this account, we cannot be sure if his symptoms might have been exaggerated by Suetnoius, and possibly also by Claudius himself. He lived to his 60s, which is impressive by itself in the ancient world, when he suffered an unnatural death, most likely. Augustus and Tiberius both died in their 70s, which was considered extraordinary.\",\n",

       " 'Baphomet is the archaic French version of the name of Mohammed. The earliest records we have of the word, prior to the trials of the Templars, were simple references to Islam. The charges of heresy and idolatry were meant not only to convict the Templars but to destroy their reputation among the royals of Europe and the people. The Templars were held in high esteem and were a major basis for the archetype for the noble Christian knights who fought for the faith against the Muslims. The charges brought against the Templars, like the posthumous ones brought against Boniface VIII, were of a nature to destroy the reputation of the accused and essentially delegitimize them as Christians and in the eyes of Medieval Europeans. Idolatry, sodomy, heresy... anything that people would hear and think “Well then it’s a good thing they’ve been arrested.” It was basically 14th Century Qanon. So, as far as the charges of idolatry and heresy go, Clement V or- very likely- the agents of King Phillip IV basically cobbled up a bunch of charges that made the Templars sound as scary and repugnant as they possibly could to a Medieval European. Most Europeans wouldn’t have known much about Islam except that it was an “enemy religion” that Christians fought against in the Crusades, and so the agents of Phillip IV and Clement V could just say whatever they wanted about it and nobody would be any the wiser. So in the trials, Baphomet (Mohammed) whom the Europeans thought was worshipped as a god in Islam (similar to Jesus in Christianity) was cited as the subject of the Templars’ heresy and the “confessions” gained by torture described worshipping Baphomet as an idol that was either a severed cat head, a severed human head, or a skull with 2-3 faces, depending on the “witness”. Now, to understand the modern image of Baphomet, one must be aware of the rise of Western Esotericism. Though it is a label retroactively applied to numerous unconnected groups, it categorizes them based on their shared ideas that they hold secret knowledge- often portrayed as restoring forgotten knowledge- outside of mainstream religions, politics, philosophy, and science. Examples are Freemasons and Theosophists, as well as the various New Age and Occult groups. They can also be groups that knowingly construct new ideas but define themselves as being against the “mainstream.” Ironically, one can argue that this includes conspiracy theorists whose conspiracies often center around claiming other esoteric groups to be evil. As victims of the Church’s persecution EDIT: in conjunction with the monarchy, the Templars became symbolic to many esoteric groups whose ideas stood in opposition to the Catholic Church and/or its power structure and entanglement with the aristocracy especially Templarist Freemasonry from the early 1700’s. The first modern usage of Baphomet was in early 19th century attempts to discredit Templarist Freemasonry by essentially using the same technique that was used against the Templars: associate them with an evil idol. Later in the 1850’s, popular occultist Eliphas Levi would incorporate his own idea of Baphomet into his teachings. He combined the idea of the Templars’ idol with the depiction of the Devil on early Tarot cards to create his famous symbolism-ridden image of “The Sabbatic Goat” which is now the ubiquitous image of Baphomet. Basically, Levi’s image was picked up and reproduced for various purposes. Some examples include: 1. Prominent evangelical cartoonist Jack Chick referred to Baphomet as the Devil. He also had numerous ideas about supposed evils of Freemasons, the Catholic Church, and Muslims. 2. Famed Occultist and subject of one of Ozzy Osbourne’s best songs, Aleister Crowley, adopted Baphomet into his religion of Thelma, citing Baphomet as the emblem of Satan, who Crowley saw as a force for good slandered by the Christian faith (to put it roughly). 3. The image of Baphomet has served as an inspiration to the image of the “Horned God” in Wicca due to its previous use in the occult. 4. Anton LaVey, founder of the Church of Satan, created the “Sigil of Baphomet” to be the official insignia for his church. It is worth noting that while the Church of Satan does believe in black magic, it does not actually believe that Satan exists, rather the idea of Satan is symbolic and the Baphomet is important for its prior use in the occult. 5. The Satanic Temple also uses the Baphomet prominently. Like the Church of Satan, they don’t believe in Satan, nor do they believe in magic, but use the Baphomet for its symbolic value as representing their own rebellion to what they see as Christianity supremacy in society (think secular humanism with a twist of John Milton twist and a penchant for First Amendment activism). They even commissioned a large Baphomet statue to be erected outside a courthouse on the idea that if the government puts the 10 Commandments on its property it should also put the Baphomet. 6. Because of Baphomet’s popular use in the occult and association with the Devil, it has been adopted as a go-to image of the Devil or a demon in popular culture, such as in Dungeons and Dragons.',\n",
       " 'i\\'m certified through the Washington state department of health as a medical cannabis consultant, and have researched a lot of how cannabis was used throughout the last few hundred years mainly in the US. Getting to America wouldn\\'t have been possible without hemp rope, sails, and pitch to make ships sea worthy. Hemp was of course a vital crop in colonial America. The number one cash crop in Kentucky for hundreds of years. Some colonies required people to grow it, and some states allowed people to pay their taxes in hemp. While it\\'s unlikely smoking cannabis was common, at the turn of the 20th century it was one of the most common things prescribed at a pharmacy, and it\\'s easy to find cannabis concoctions from companies like Eli Lilly. I have found pictures of packs of joints that were used specifically for asthma, as certain terpenes and cannabinoid combinations can actually act as bronchodilators. We know many founding fathers grew hemp on their land, Thomas Jefferson noted in his diary about \"a particularly good smelling female hemp plant\". the female plants being the ones we smoke today. In 1937 the marihuana tax stamp act, which required you to possess marijuana, to obtain the stamp needed to possess marijuana. clearly unconstitutional because you had to self incriminate and do something illegal to obtain the stamp. but even after it was found unconstitutional they just made new laws making it illegal to possess cannabis. in 1944 Mayor Laguardia commissioned a panel of doctors that found no reason to make cannabis illegal, and until 1944 cannabis was found in the US pharmacopeia. People weren\\'t scared of cannabis, they used it for everything from migraines, and cramps to dysentery, and was a very commonly prescribed. However William Randolf Hearst started running racially based (i\\'d say stupid racist but have to maintain objectivity) articles talking about how smoked marijuana was awful (seriously go look for the articles, they\\'re a nightmare). The combination of Hearst with his pulp mill interests that hemp directly competed with, the Du Pont family discovering synthetic nylon, and alcohol prohibition ending, left a whole agency of government with nothing to do, and they turned their focus to cannabis. When the laws about marijuana passed, and people couldn\\'t get their cannabis products anymore a lot of people were surprised that marijuana was cannabis. Marijuana is not a name that actually had anything to do with cannabis until Hearst printed it in his newspapers. it only became counter culture in the 50s 60s and 70s with a generation that grew up with reefer madness that knew it wasn\\'t true. but it was too late. people born after 1944 grew up hearing nothing but how cannabis would give you schizophrenia, even though there is no scientific study to back that claim up. (if you have a history of mental illness, high THC might not be ideal though) in the 1960\\'s Dr. Raphael Mechoulam isolated THC and many of the other cannabinoids, and in the 1990\\'s he discovered the endocannabinoid system that they interact with. Since then the study of cannabis has changed immensely as we know the endocannabinoid system is the bodies master modulatory system and responsible for regulating anything that is over or under stimulated. Dr. Ethan Russo\\'s paper Taming THC is really the basis for todays medical cannabis revolution and our understanding of different cannabinoids interaction with different systems of the body. historically there is only about an 80 year prohibition on cannabis, and before that it was a vital crop',\n",
       " \"While I cannot go much deeper into the areas beyond the 'era of modernisation', I believe I will be able to delineate a general picture. The turning point, it seems to me, lies in this era from the 19th century onwards. But I cannot help much about the impact of the Ottoman family law(s) to the Ottoman successor states mainly because I focus on Turkey and, as we will see, Turkey abolished even the 'secularised' version of the Ottoman family law in the Republican era. The social and legal ordering of the Ottoman society before and after the era of Tanzimat (beginning in the 1830s and really kicking off in 1839) followed the lineages of the 'millet system'. According to this, all major non-Muslim groups were treated as separate, quasi-independent 'states within the state'. The very word millet is ambiguous here; it used to refer to this ethnic-religious groupings before and has come to refer more strictly to the ethnic-national groups today. Each 'millet', Jews, Greeks or Armenians, had their own religious laws, presided over by their own clergymen, applying their own religious rules. As for inter-confessional issues in family law, no such a thing existed to my knowledge, barring one example. According to Islamic law in the Ottoman Empire, a Muslim woman could not marry a non-Muslim man. A Muslim man could marry a non-Muslim woman but, on the condition that the offspring will be raised as proper Muslims. To ensure this, sometimes the woman was asked to convert to Islam before the children grew sufficiently to understand and be influenced by their mother on such serious issues. The Islamic law itself is I suppose better known. It allowed for, but in the Ottoman case tended to discourage, polygyny. A man was allowed to marry up to four women. He was also supposed to take care of them and to treat them well by providing for them. Though it would wane in comparison with what women in most countries have nowadays, women had a legal right to make complaints about their husbands when they violated any part of their marriage contract and had the right to divorce. Roughly speaking, this was the Islamic law as practised under the Ottomans. Family law remained the untouchable area of law in the Ottoman Empire under the Tanzimat era. What I have depicted above, in fact, used to apply to a variety of other legal fields. The new 'Nizamiye Courts' that appeared first to address commercial cases during the Tanzimat began to encompass wider areas of Ottoman society with time. This they did generally by applying laws that were either modelled after Western (generally French) laws or partially translated from them. However, scholars such as Avi Rubin remind us that this should not be read as a triumphant march from the Islamic era to the radically Westernising era. The personnel of the Nizamiye courts happened to be the same chaps that participated in dealing with the Sharia cases, for instance. Rubin also downplays the role of direct Western inspiration in legislation. I would not go as far to say there are multiple modernities (if modernity and the diffusion of Western practices will have any meaning for our historical analyses) but he is absolutely right that the Tanzimat era was not one giant step towards the inevitable goal of radical Westernisation in law and society, as it were. As before, more importantly, the family law remained the field of the Shariah (and other religious courts). Towards the end of the Tanzimat, Mecelle emerged as a codified, formalised version of Islamic law. It was rumoured that one of the Tanzimat statesmen, Mehmed Emin Ali Pasha, actually wanted to import the French Civil Code but was admonished by the more conservative elites not to go too far. We do not know whether this is true or not but what is certain is that even the Tanzimat did not bring about a major change in the issue of family law. Importantly, even Mecelle itself did not touch upon the subject of family law much, presumably because Mecelle was intended for use in the Nizamiye courts and the family law was still seen strictly as the business of religious courts. The most important change in the imperial era occurred during the First World War, when the Committee of Union and Progress passed a decree called 'The Decree on Family Law' in 1917. The decree is sometimes seen as the hallmark of the new, secularised, 'modern' Ottoman family law. This is certainly an exaggeration. The law codified and formalised Ottoman Muslim family laws by drawing on a variety of Muslim schools of thought. It regulated the application of family law (much as previous steps tried for different areas) predictable and formal. In the past, a certain degree of legal pluralism existed with plaintiffs able to choose to which court they want to take the case and with the court officials free to draw from this or that line of Islamic jurisprudence. This degree did much to limit these. Together with it, certain acts by the CUP meant that the authority of the 'millet' clergymen was somewhat diminished as well, with more control given to the state in recording and approving marriages. That said, this does not mean a radical break, since these changes often did not concern the legal rules at all. There were still multiple courts applying different sets of laws largely derived from different religions. While the Islamic law was now codified and clearly set out for all judges to follow, it was still Islamic law, though 'modernised' at times by drawing from multiple schools of jurisprudence. The Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 did not do much to change this either. Though it basically meant the Western states now recognised the new Turkey, to be a republic within months, this new Turkey was not as yet all that new. The Sharia courts still remained and so did legal pluralism. In fact, one article of the Treaty in particular guaranteed the freedom of minorities in Turkey (read non-Muslim minorities as before) to apply their own religious laws to their own cases. All this changed in 1926 when a rapidly secularising Turkey legislated a new Civil Code largely translated from the Swiss one. This removed all references to Islam, raised the age of consent, formally banned polygyny (rarer among Turkish-speakers than the Arabic regions in the Ottoman Empire anyway), and so, it was quite a case of Westernisation. The new Civil Code of 1926 also bypassed the Article 42 of Lausanne. Jews, Armenians and Greeks of Turkey were asked and accepted (how willingly I would not know) to renounce their right to use their religious law and accepted that as Turkish citizens, they could take their cases only to secular courts of the state. This meant that one of the last remnants of the millet system thus disappeared in Turkey. Today, it is still common among Turks to have their marriage first 'approved', as it were, by an imam and then by the state. The rules that these imams follow are naturally Islamic and closest to the late Ottoman practices. But this is neither illegal nor has any legal backing. Nobody faces any legal consequences for walking away from an Islamic marriage contract, besides, depending on the location, the good old social pressure. I do not know if this was enough to answer all your questions, but I hope to have been able to answer at least some of your questions as they related to Turkey. I hope this helps!

       " \"In describing your question, you have come pretty close to answering it. The design of a early gun can be summarized as lock, stock, and barrel. The lock was the firing mechanism. The barrel was the tube that contained the explosion and guided the bullet. The stock was the wooden handle that all the other pieces were assembled into, to hold them. In order to make a lot of anything, in the pre-industrial world ( if there was a big market), craftspeople specialized. To make enough guns for an army, there were specialist gunsmiths working in big shops, either working in an armory or supplying one. In the case of 18th c. England, the specialists making locks and barrels were mostly in Birmingham. The lock making shops would have smiths using forging dies to generate rough pieces, and other men with a variety of files doing the shaping, others polishing. Barrels would be forge welded by smiths , bored using water powered boring machines, then ground to profile by polishers using large water powered grindstones. Those metal parts would be sent to the Tower in London, where barrels were certified to be the right caliber, proofed to make sure they would not blow up, and the locks certified. Then those metals parts would be supplied to other specialist shops who would assemble them into a stock.( Yes, this is simplified- the assembly would be a part of the stocks shaping process, and there were brass pieces, called furniture, and triggers.... but you get the idea.) This specialization was good enough for the purpose of making a muzzle-loader. The only important uniformity was the caliber, and everything else, like the stocks, could just be pretty close- patterns were lent to the various makers, and the Brown Bess was called the Land Pattern Musket. However, the French ( precisely, a gunsmith named Honoré Blanc) realized that if they could have all the parts of a musket interchangeable, all exactly alike, it would be possible to easily repair them in the field. They didn't get very far in this- that meant working by hand, with all sort of measuring gauges and patterns, to make identical things to very tight tolerances, and this was much more work. However, the idea was immensely appealing to the US ambassador to France, Thomas Jefferson, and he brought it home, and it took root in the minds of American armorers. In the early 1800's, a gunsmith named John Hall came up with a breech-loading rifle , and got a contract to build them for the US government. He was able to set up his shop at the Harper's Ferry Armory in 1819 in order to do so- where many specialist barrel-welders, lock filers etc were already making guns ( and many of them were sons, grandsons of gunsmiths in the area- so they had some very good hand skills). Breech-loaders had been around before then, as you notice. But a muzzle-loader only had a barrel with one open end- so containing the 10,000 PSI pressure of the explosion of the powder charge was relatively simple. As the barrel of a breech-loader was open at both ends, the breech mechanism to contain that high pressure gas had to fit pretty tightly. That mechanism therefore had to be carefully filed and fitted, which took a lot of time. Which is why breech-loaders were quite expensive. Hall wanted to make his breechloading guns with interchangeable parts. He also wanted to make them relatively quickly, in order to make a profit. And he knew that machine metalworking tools were being pioneered by the British. So, he set up his shop with milling machines and lathes- but, more importantly, he set it up also with gauges, jigs and fixtures. That made it possible to do repeated operations: to cut the side profile of, say, one left breech hinge piece, then set another in the same milling machine fixture and cut another left breech hinge piece, and get the same dimension. Now , it would be far too much to say that suddenly there was no point to having guys with files, grindstones: they would stay very important. But a lot of the work was accomplished. Hall's shop failed, for various reasons . But Hall's system was noticed, and copied. As breech-loading designs evolved, requiring more and more complex mechanisms, the system was crucial. The Springfield Armory adopted it- you could even say, it became their religion. One very large shop in Vermont, the Robbins and Lawrence shop, became a source of special metal cutting machinery and tooling, and making , yes, breech-loading guns: the Sharps rifle would mostly be made there. In the later 1800's, the hundreds of small gunsmith shops that had been making muzzle-loading rifles and guns had mostly given up, and a gunsmith became mostly a repairman. Of course, the same can be said for blacksmiths making hinges, locksmiths making locks: they, too, stopped manufacturing and became more often repairmen. The ability to do repeated operations was useful for more than guns- it quickly was adopted for manufacturing everything: sewing machines, bicycles, whatever. It's just that the job of making enough guns to outfit an army had required so much production capacity, it's understandable that it would be what's called the American System really first started. Again, this is somewhat simplified: there were other places where some mass production techniques were being used earlier, like Matthew Boulton's factory in Birmingham. But Hall's innovation really was key. Even with mass production techniques, equipping a big army would always be a challenge. When the Dreyse rifle appeared, many countries, like Britain , France and Belgium, settled initially for just a conversion of their existing muzzle-loaders: the Snider Enfield required a new breech mechanism, but the rest of it was a 1855 Enfield rifle. And even the US: despite Hall's design, it avoided the expense of converting the armories over to breech-loading guns through the early 1800's, even as the War Dept. tried out various designs of private manufacturers. When the Civil War did break out, the War Dept bought breechloaders- but mostly for the cavalry: there was never a hope of making enough for the whole army. And after the War, the War Dept settled on its own breechloading musket conversion- which , modified and improved, became known as the Trapdoor Springfield. And the Armory would experience the downside of mass production: inflexibility. Once all the special jigs, fixtures and tools were in place to build piles and piles of Trapdoor Springfields, it was hard to make something else. It would resist making more modern magazine smokeless powder weapons until 1890. Merritt Roe Smith: Harper's Ferry Armory and the New Technology\",\n",

       " 'The earliest insulated wire used either woven cloth impregnated with pitch, wax, and/or resin, or a coating of hard wax (without the cloth). Wires like these were used to study static electricity, which often involved high voltages. The biggest problem with the hard wax coating was that it would crack when the wire bent, unless it was warmed sufficiently. This made it OK for things like coils which could be wound warm, and then the wire wouldn\\'t need to be bent again. Impregnated cloth insulation could also suffer from cracking, depending on the flexibility. Softer wax coatings tended to stick, so wire wound onto a spool would stick together. Early 19th century electrical experimenters such as Faraday used wires wrapped in cloth or string. Working with electric currents rather than high static voltages, this provided sufficiently insulation and was flexible. It was also relatively thick, and not good for winding compact coils. Thin wire covered with thin silk was used for winding compact coils for, e.g., galvanometers. (Faraday used heavier wire with thicker, more heat-resistant insulation, because he worked with higher currents which would have fried the kind of fine wire used in such galvanometers.) At the time, wide-brimmed women\\'s hats were often stiffened by cotton-coated iron wire (and Faraday used such bonnet wire in his experiments occasionally). Thus, a common way to get insulated copper wire was to take the wire to a \"bonnet-wire maker\" and pay to have the wire covered with silk or cotton. By the 1830s, there was enough demand for commercial manufacture, and insulated wire appeared for sale in catalogs. For uses such as galvanometer coils, thinner was better, and less flexibility was needed, and lacquer coatings were common. The problem with simple silk or cotton covered wire was that moisture would reduce the effectiveness of the insulation. Thus, for use where moisture might be problem, the silk or cotton coating was impregnated with oil, wax, natural rubber, or similar. Paper could also be used as the fibrous coating, similarly impregnated. This was basically the standard insulation until after WWII. In the 1930s, PVC-coated wire started to appear, and other synthetic polymers were experimented with, and these became widely used in the 1950s. This brought advantages such as lower cost, better insulating properties, better resistance to moisture, and being less susceptible to attack by pests. While mice and rats will still chew through PVC-insulated cables, at high risk to their own lives, and significant fire risk to the building, PVC cables are less attractive than impregnated cloth cables (the German attempt to relieve the trapped-in-Stalingrad 6th Army suffered when most of the tanks of the 22nd Panzer Division wouldn\\'t start because hungry mice had eaten the insulation from their wires). For the early history of insulated wires, see Allan A. Mills , \"The Early History of Insulated Copper Wire\", Annals of Science 61:4, 453-467, https://doi.org/10.1080/00033790110117476',\n",

By the 1850s, the silk or cotton covering would have then been covered in gutta-percha latex to make it waterproof enough for undersea cables - no modern chemical products needed. By the time Tesla and Edison came onto the scene in the 1880s, commercial insulated wire would have been nearly fifty years old.',\n",
       " 'This is actually a story I came across when writing this answer about convoys in the Bering Sea and the ALSIB air route. This translated article by Russian historian Alla Paperno has some information on the air crews in question. She notes that the following US air crews crashed or landed in the Soviet Far East: one of the Doolittle Raid bombers in 1942, 242 crewmembers from B-24, B-25, and PV-1 planes carrying out emergency landings in Kamchatka in 1943-1945, and four B-29 Superfortresses in 1944. The interned aircrews were collected first in facilities in Khabarovsk (a military hospital and an officers\\' rest camp). They were then transferred from the Soviet Far East by train to a specially constructed internment camp for them outside Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The camp conditions were certainly better than a standard POW camp - the aircews built baseball diamonds, volleyball and basketball courts, received reading materials from the US embassy in Moscow, and were able to send telegrams to family members in the US. It was from here that four \"escapes\" were staged over the border into Iran (and ultimately to the British occupation zone in that country). What\\'s interesting about the escapes is that apparently the aircrew were transferred by rail to Turkmenistan, to be taken over the border in Soviet trucks, when American journalist Drew Pearson wrote a story claiming one of the Doolittle Raid airmen had been released from the USSR, and the Soviets got cold feet over the operation, fearing the planned releases would endanger Soviet neutrality with Japan. A number of aircrew tried to make it over the border on their own when the operation was held up, but Soviet guards apprehended them. Eventually the Soviets relented to US diplomatic pressure and the \"escapes\" were organized and carried out - these apparently involved the NKVD loading the aircrew onto trucks and driving them all the way to Iran (where the US military took over custody, and the aircrews were flown to Egypt, then Naples, and then shipped back to the US). Additional source: George A. Larson. \"American Airmen Held as POWs in Far East Russia during World War II\". Air Power History. Vol. 59, No. 2 (SUMMER 2012). Note: this is an interesting account of the internment, and uses information gathered from interviews with some of the air crews, but some of its details are incorrect. Such as: the aircrews were internees, not Prisoners of War, and it claims Tashkent is 30 miles from the Iranian border. It\\'s over 500 miles from the border; the author seems to have gotten Tashkent confused with Ashgabat, Turkmenistan.',\n",
       " 'Merlin - the quintessential European wizard takes heavy inspiration from preexisting myths about the chief magician of the Norse gods, Odin. ( scholarly article detailing significant overlap in the Merlin/Odin myths) Odin is also often depicted with a staff, and Norse myth is reworked into Arthurian legend pretty readily. The sword Gram being shoved in a tree by Odin and only the rightful king could remove it is pretty clear as a predecessor to the \"sword in the stone\". (Source: The Volsunga Saga). We first get reference to Odin being worshipped by the Germanic people in the 1st century in Tacitus\\' Germania where he was equated with Mercury. Austrian professor Rudolf Simek claims that there\\'s some evidence of Odin already being depicted with his staff and his hat - which was partially why the Romans considered him analogous to Mercury. Odin is mentioned in old English magic, such as the Nine Herb Charm. Another prominent figure that could contribute but has less of a direct lineage is Moses, being depicted as performing miracles by the raising of his staff. This would have grown in prominence as the Christianization of Europe commenced, but if Simek\\'s claims are correct that Odin was already being shown with his staff in the 1st century then it\\'s more likely that Moses\\' staff-wielding did not have as direct an impact on views of magic. This last bit is speculation - It seems likely to me that various cultures would independently connect staffs with magic as the elderly were often the archetypes of the mystical. But to directly answer your question - The wizard staff in European fiction is likely derived from depictions of Odin with a staff that influenced Merlin to have a staff and Merlin was used as the basis for future wizard characters.',\n",
       " \"The town looks like the name 'Dadizeele', which would correspond to the Belgian village of Dadizele. Found ~15 miles east of Ypres, it was liberated by II Corps (which contained the 36th (Ulster) Division) during the 4th Battle of Ypres and the following Battle of Courtrai. During these battles, the 36th Division saw some heavy fighting, even against a German army that was exhausted by its previous attacks and reeling from a broad-front Allied offensive. On the 30th September, the 36th saw heavy fighting as they captured Hill 41, a significant terrain feature to the south of Dadizele. On the 13th-14th October, the division was involved in the opening stages of the Battle of Courtrai. The fighting saw the division break through the German front lines and capture the town of Moorseele, before turning south to take the strongpoint of Gulleghem, which was holding up the advance of the 29th Division. His citation for the award of the medal can be found here It describes him showing general gallantry throughout the fighting in October and November, as well as a particular action where he displayed enthusiasm, courage and leadership under fire during preparations for the advance from Dadizele towards Moorseele. As far as the medals go, two of them are campaign medals, awarded to everyone who served in a given campaign or timeframe. Going left-to-right, the first medal is the Distinguished Conduct Medal. This was awarded to other ranks (enlisted men, in modern parlance) in the British Army, with an equivalent medal, the Distinguished Service Order, for officers. It was one of the highest medals that could be awarded, second only to the Victoria Cross. However, it was also more widely awarded than the VC, to the point where the Army instituted a lesser medal, the Military Medal, to prevent the DCM being devalued as an award. The second medal is the British War Medal, awarded to any officer or enlisted man who served in the Army, Navy or RAF between August 1914 and November 1918. The third medal is the Victory Medal, which was awarded to anyone who had served as part of the armed services in a combat theatre in the same time-frame.\",\n",
       " 'Personally, although it often got boiled down in popular consciousness to \"communism\", the big, primary concern of the US government was Soviet influence. Which is to say, for example, while a lot of Americans in the 1950s would look askance at any sort of Marxist group, the big concern among the government and authorities were groups that were either openly favorable to Soviet foreign policy (like CPUSA) or groups that might be front organizations controlled by Communist Party members, or individuals under the influence of Soviet intelligence. This was a major driver of the Red Scare of the late 1940s and 1950s, although as I wrote here it was singularly ineffective in finding Soviet spies Another reason that \"fighting communism\", while it might have made a good slogan, does not accurately reflect US policy in the Cold War are the times the US developed friendly ties with communist regimes. The most famous will of course be the People\\'s Republic of China, which the US developed favorable relations with from the early 1970s on. This was clearly for geopolitical, not ideological reasons. Nixon made a political career of red-baiting, while Mao had long denounced the USSR as \"revisionist\" and traitors to Stalin\\'s legacy yet both men met and helped develop cordial relations between both countries (the US would sell billions of dollars\\' worth of weapons to the PRC until 1989). And China was not the only example. Tito\\'s Yugoslavia, after breaking with Stalin in 1948, developed warmer ties with the US, even winning foreign aid. Ceausescu\\'s Romania, pursuing an independent foreign policy (it did not participate in and criticized the Warsaw Pact\\'s invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968), also developed good ties with the US, with the government promoting private US loans to the country and Ceausescu even getting a photo op with the First Family from a White House balcony. Support for other communist regimes or movements that were fighting the Soviets or Soviet allies was often indirect or clandestine, but very much a reality. Official recognition of the Chinese-client Khmer Rouge as the official Cambodian government after the 1979 Vietnamese invasion is perhaps the most notorious example, but there are a few others as well, such as US support for Siad Barre\\'s Somalia after it went to war with Ethiopia (Somalia and Ethiopia were both Soviet clients at the start of the war, but the Soviets threw in behind Ethiopia, so Somalia eventually got US support). Angola\\'s UNITA would likewise be lionized as anti-communist freedom fighters in the 1980s, but had originally started out as a PRC-funded communist group before the US took over financing it.',\n",
       " \"The answer by u/MAXSquid does get at some important themes, but I think there is much more to the history of Communism and anti-Communism in the United States that we can delve into. The First Red Scare in the United States comes about after the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia in 1917. Not only was Bolshevism the antithesis of the liberal capitalist tradition in the United States, but this was also the height of wartime anxiety, suspicion, and jingoism in the United States. I've written here about the surveillance programs that got their start during WW1. Communism was linked to subversive activity, anti-state movements, and anarchism, all of which were directly counter to the interests of the US state. So from the first moment that Communism as a political force really has a large presence in the mindset of most Americans, it is linked to the notion of subversion or treason. Communism reemerges as a boogieman in the aftermath of WW2. I'm sure there are countless answers on the suspicion between the Allied Powers and the quick collapse of the old wartime alliance. To put it simply, the Truman administration soon agreed with Churchill's assessment that the Soviet Union was aggressively expanding its sphere of influence and forcibly installing Communist governments in Eastern Europe as opposed to letting those formerly Nazi-occupied states go their own way. Much like how electoral victories of Fascist parties led to the end of democratic elections during the 1930s, there was a similar concern that Communist governments emerging in European countries would mean their automatic allegiance to Moscow and authoritarianism. There was also geopolitical rivalry for very material reasons, and the Western allies rightfully were concerned that Europe would fall entirely under the sway of the Soviet Union. Thus communism was hitched to rivalry with the Soviet Union. Building off of wartime narratives about the importance of loyalty (and the accepted notion that most Japanese-Americans could not be trusted to be loyal), the moment was ripe for increased public and government anxiety about the possibility of disloyal Communist subversives within the US. Part of the reason why the US government tended to see subversion as a concern, as opposed to outright Soviet aggression, was precisely because the Truman administration was confident that the Soviet Union would need several years to rebuild its strength after WW2. The logic here was that while the US had the advantage in most areas of conventional strength, the Soviet Union would resort to subversive activities and espionage in order to either weaken the United States or close the technological gap through theft. By the time Senator Joseph McCarthy begins making waves in Washington, through introducing internal security acts, alleging the presence of disloyal communists within the ranks of the Truman administration, and calling for the termination of high-ranking US officials, the stage was set for broad public acceptance of the narrative that Communist spies could be anywhere. Why is anti-communism invoked to justify US interventions abroad? Going along with the assumption that communist movements are inherently linked, in some fashion, to Moscow, the activities of Communism globally becomes linked to foreign policy concerns. Thus, the Korean War was not just a civil war story of the communist North attacking the South--it was a story of Moscow advancing its geopolitical position in the unstable East Asian region. The victory of Chinese communists in 1949 against the better-equipped Nationalist regime in China, also, increased American anxiety about how Communist movements could take root among the rural poor and take over a country, further turning the tides against the US. Was there ever a chance for communism to actually be a domestic threat in the United States? Probably not. But the shocking victory of Communism in China, the rapid installation of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe, and the perception that it was very, very easy for Communist agitators to build a movement among the poor and destitute, added to an American sense of vulnerability. And yes, anti-communism and Red Scares happen all over the world during the 1950s. Masuda Hajimu has a fascinating book which explores the series of anti-leftist crackdowns that happen in Taiwan (the White Terror), Great Britain, and Japan. While some crackdowns were indeed surface-level justifications for certain political elements to advance their own interests, the anti-Communist justification was an easy one precisely because of the overwhelming sense of anxiety and fear of subversion and instability in the postwar period.

       " 'Greetings! I shall build off the excellent answers of u/Kochevnik81 and u/CapriciousCupofTea by delving a bit more into the geopolitical side of the Cold War\\'s origins. It remains of course, a historiographical debate of considerable (though by no means dominant or overarching) influence as to what extent ideology really motivated the US to do what it did over those 50 or so odd years. Our starting point for this is 1945, Ian Buruma\\'s cheerfully named \"Year Zero\". Let\\'s begin. The Potsdam Problems As Kochevnik81 pointed out in their response, Communism may have served as the ideological byword of \"Soviet influence\". The United States did not, as CapriciousCupOfTea notes, exactly find the Bolshevik revolution in Russia and the resulting government of the USSR \"to their taste\", so to speak. The Second World War of course, put aside those ideological differences for the time being, as both Uncle Sam and the Soviet Sickle had a common enemy to defeat: Hitler\\'s Nazi Germany. Once that threat had been defeated after four years of taxing and brutal conflict however, it remained unclear as to what the USSR and USA had in store for Europe. The British Empire was now a setting Empire, so historians often point to the post-war period as the emergence (but not necessarily a rapid one), of the \"two-superpower world\". The first signs of tension between the two superpowers came during the Potsdam Conference (July 17th - August 2nd, 1945). Joseph Stalin was the last of the \"Big Three\" Allied leaders who remained in power (Churchill lost the general election to Attlee during the conference, and Truman had replaced the late President Franklin D. Roosevelt after his death in April). This sparked misunderstandings and a fair bit of concern from both sides. Truman for his part, was not at all experienced with the Soviets, and he was more suspecting of their intentions than Roosevelt had been. He even recorded after a meeting with Stalin at Potsdam that \"the Russian were planning world conquest\". The key question on everyone\\'s mind was the shape of post-war Europe, and it was here that we get the \"spheres of influence\" dimension to the whole geopolitical mess that would become the Cold War. Stalin, with the cooperation of Roosevelt and Churchill, believed that the Soviet Union deserved the rights to exercise some influence (but not control, mind you) over Eastern Europe (Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria etc.). Truman however, alongside his Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, believed (perhaps rightly so) that Stalin would immediately begin transforming these nations into Soviet puppet-states. Byrnes was particularly concerned with Poland, where Moscow had set up a sponsored government in January called the \"Lublin Poles\", which complicated the fact that the pre-war Polish government-in-exile (the so called \"London Poles\") also wished to govern the country. In the end Byrnes agreed to give recognition to the Soviet government, but insisted (as Churchill had at Yalta), that Stalin allow \"free elections\" (a term which pops up a lot in American diplomacy during the Cold War, and in some instances a hilarious irony) to take place at the earliest possible moment. Stalin viewed this insistence as signs of American influence, which he found somewhat concerning. For the rest of Eastern Europe, hard facts dictated the options. The Red Army had liberated much of the region from Third Reich, so Stalin had practically incontestable reason to exert his influence over these states. Historian Thomas Patterson notes however, that this influence was itself motivated due to \"profound security fears\" over Eastern Europe, as it had been from this region that the Nazis had launched their catastrophically bloody war against the Soviets. The Long Telegram The concerns which Truman left Potsdam with were further reinforced in February 1946, when George F. Kennan, head of the US Embassy in Moscow, telegrams a 5,653 word report on the state of Soviet intentions with regards to the US and Europe. Here\\'s an extract from that telegram: “We have here a political force committed fanatically to the belief that with the US there can be no permanent modus vivendi, that it is desirable and necessary that... the international authority of our state be broken, if Soviet power is to be secure... Many foreign peoples, in Europe at least, are tired and frightened by experiences of the past, and are less interested in abstract freedom than in security. They are seeking guidance rather than responsibilities. We should be better able than the Russians to give them this. And unless we do, the Russians certainly will. In July, Truman himself ordered adviser Clark Clifford to write a top-secret report based on the \"Long Telegram\" in order to form a new and concrete American foreign policy towards the USSR. The result, the Clifford-Elsey report, was instrumental in the Truman Doctrine to follow (and the ideological spin which it evolved): “As long as the Soviet Government adheres to its present policy, the United States should maintain military forces powerful enough to restrain the Soviet Union and confine Soviet influence to its present area. All nations not now within the Soviet sphere should be given generous economic assistance and political support in their opposition to Soviet penetration.” Note that the Clifford-Elsey Report and the Long Telegram did not actually frame Communism as the main reason for Soviet expansionist desires, but both reports considered it a possible reason for Stalin\\'s \"aggressive\" designs for Eastern Europe. The Soviets for their part, eyed the American \"Open Door\" Policy (by which American economic and even military influence was spread across the world, sometimes under force) with suspicion, fearful that such influence would undermine their \"bloc\" in Eastern Europe. The Truman Doctrine On March 12, 1947, Truman presented his new policy to the American Congress. He took care not to explicitly mention the Soviet Union, but he did emphasise (and imply strongly) the aspect of Communism in fueling Soviet doctrine, something which key advisers (among them Kennan himself and Secretary of State Dean Acheson) would later critique: “I believe it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures...I believe that we must assist free peoples to work out their own destinies in their own way... I believe that our help should be primarily through economic and financial aid which is essential to economic stability and orderly political processes.” What followed was the Marshall Plan, which further incited Soviet concern over America\\'s increasing economic and political hold over Western Europe. To that end, in September of 1947 Stalin and the heads of various Communist parties across Eastern (and even Western) Europe met in Poland to form the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers\\' Parties (shortened to \"Cominform\"). At the conference where this happened, Andrei Zhdanov gave his famous \"Two Camps Speech\", now solidifying the ideological and geopolitical rivalry which had come about: “A new alignment of political forces has arisen. The more the war recedes into the past, the more distinct become two major trends in post-war international policy, corresponding to the division of the political forces operating on the international arena into two major camps: the imperialist and anti-democratic camp America, on the one hand, and the anti-imperialist and democratic camp on the other The USSR..The vague and deliberately guarded formulations of the Marshall Plan amount in essence to a scheme to create blocs of states bound by obligations to the United States, and to grant American credit to European countries as a recompense for their renunciation of economic, and then of political, independence.\"',\n",
       " 'I\\'m not so sure on how true this statement this, but can say a bit about how integration of former Nazis particularly in the military, bureaucratic and political spheres was justified. In both Germany\\'s in the immediate aftermath of WW2 the Nazi regime was considered officially to have been a regime predominantly made up of a small clique of fanatics who repressed the German people - Germans were presented as much as victims as the people conquered by the Nazis, as the Nazi\\'s rather then Germans were blamed for all that had gone wrong since 1933. There were differences in this broad narrative - west Germany presented the \"victims\" predominantly through the lenses of Germans who had been expelled from parts of central and eastern Europe during the Soviet advance and put primary responsibility of Nazi crimes on members of the Nazi party themselves (helping perpetuate the clean Wehrmacht myth amongst others). In East Germany, it was presented as the German workers\\' being repressed by a cabal of military officers, Nazi party functionaries, conservative bureaucrats and wealthy industrialists/capitalists hence the slightly stronger public denazification in the east. Neither of the Germany\\'s acknowledged that the Nazis had been more-or-less fairly popular in the early 1930\\'s and accepted by a large proportion of Germans, and often sought to explain Nazi rule through the lenses of Hitler somehow \"tricking\" the German populace through brilliant rhetoric and a sound economic policy. Because the German people were presented moreso as victims of the Nazis rather then enablers it was easy to say that former Nazis had been forced into/tricked into their roles, and so bore no guilt for the atrocities done under the Nazi\\'s, especially so if they weren\\'t members of organisations like the SS (of which many former SS officers attempted to bury that part of their past due to the stigma it carried). It\\'s only really in the late 1960\\'s that in west Germany a serious reflection of German guilt for the Nazi regime takes hold in society, with that process beginning in earnest in the east following the collapse of the Berlin wall. Source: The Search for Reconciliation: Sino-Japanese and German-Polish Relations since World War II, Yinan He. Note that this process of blaming a small clique for the atrocities of WW2 also applies for Japan as well and additionally helps explain why former militarist bureaucrats, generals and politicians continued to exercise power in post-war Japan.',\n",
       " 'I can discuss the Abenaki, the indigenous people of Maine. Now, Maine doesn\\'t get a lot of extreme weather like tornadoes or earthquakes, but it does have one particularly deadly weather event every year: winter. It\\'s easy to forget how dangerous subzero temperatures are with our fancy jackets and modern, heated homes, but temperatures like that can kill in a surprisingly short amount of time if one is exposed. And of course, there is snow. So much snow. Nor\\'Easters can dump several feet of snow in a single day, possibly even burying entire dwelling places. If you\\'re ever snowshoed in deep snow, you can probably appreciate the myriad of complications that can be present living in the middle of such a mess. Other difficult weather events common to Maine are ice storms and freezing rain. Difficult enough in modern times, potentially deadly when you are living in a wigwam and spending a significant amount of time outdoors, hunting for game. So, autumn has come to an end, and your family has left the coastal summer village, heading deep into the woods in hope of killing and trapping enough game to avoid starvation. Your family has harvested the squash you planted last spring in a river bank, which should last for a while, though not all winter. There isn\\'t a lot of snow, yet, but it\\'s coming. How do you survive in an environment where the air and precipitation are basically trying to kill you? The first protection from the cold, rain, and snow is your \"clothes.\" The Abenaki wore thick furs, sometimes multiple layers of it, and it could be quite toasty, though, from personal experience, it\\'s a bit like walking around in a heavy bath robe. On your feet are moccasins, which might be nested in a kind of fur \"feet mittens\" for added protection against the frozen ground. As the snow deepens, you will need birch bark snow shoes to stay on top of things, literally. (The importance of birth bark to the Abenaki cannot be understated.) You would also probably, but not always, be wearing animal skin trousers, or even trousers made of, believe it or not, birch bark. So you\\'re all bundled up, which will protect you for at least a number of hours in the cold. The next order of business is shelter, and it is here we meet the true hero of surviving the extreme cold: the wigwam. Abenaki wigwams were ingenious structures. Young saplings would be harvested in the spring and bent into dome-shaped, or sometimes conical, frames. Sheets of birch bark would then be cut from white birch trees with sharp stones and layered over the top of the frame for the roof, with a hole in the center to let smoke from the ever-burning fire escape. Furthermore, benches would be built inside along the walls for sitting and sleeping. Even with a fire in the hearth, sleeping on the ground in these temperatures was dangerous. A wigwam would look something like this: https://orbitalstudiespawn.weebly.com/woodland.html (Note that this is what a wigwam would look like in the southern woodlands. An Abenaki wigwam would be covered in white paper birch. Almost all Eastern Woodlands peoples used the same style.) Wigwams took time to build every year, and stripping the bark was truly a group effort. So if you found yourself \"between homes,\" as it were, you\\'d probably be living in a much smaller, simpler structure called a wikiup, sleeping on the ground. Not comfortable, but better than freezing to death. Now, birch bark is fine in the summer, when the days are (relatively) warm and the little Abenaki kiddos are running around naked, but it\\'s not exactly insulated. Autumn comes, there\\'s a crisp chill in the air... And your shelter is cold. At this point, the Abenaki would cover their wigwams with mud, or better yet, moss, not only for insulation, but to repel the autumn rains, which moss excelled at. The Abenaki used moss for many things, including as a liner in their babies diapers! Next comes the snow. In this case, snow is your friend. It covers the wigwam and acts as an insulator. Now you have a layer of bark, a layer of moss, and a thick layer of snow. Your wigwam looks more like an igloo at this point, and like the igloo, it\\'s surprisingly toasty inside. Imagine a Maine winters night in the forest. The winter winds howl, the trees start to \"pop\" temperature drops below zero. But there\\'s a fire going in the hearth, your belly is full of warm squirrel stew, and you are wrapped in furs. The fire slowly dies down, the interior temperature drops so much that the water freezes in the gourd bottles... But you are safe. As for the few serious weather events in Maine, like blizzards, Nor\\'Easters, and freezing rain, the dome shape of the wigwam and the sapling frame could withstand a lot of external stress. So, while I can\\'t speak for other indigenous peoples, the Abenaki weathered extreme weather the exact same way we do today: seek shelter from the elements. And while blizzards undoubtedly took lives if an Abenaki individual were caught by surprise far from their winter camp, there was a far more deadly foe to worry about: starvation. It was not uncommon for families to fast for multiple days in their winter camps. And, upon returning to the summer villages in the spring, it was not uncommon to notice that not everyone from last year made it back. There are tales of Abenaki hunters discovering old winter camps and finding the emaciated corpses of an entire family inside. This was an unfortunate reality of living in the far north.

However, for better or worse, many of these questions about what Hitler thought are, in the literal sense, unanswerable. We don\\'t know what Hitler thought about many things, and especially about things which were inconsequential for him. Hitler did not keep a diary, and the collections of his private conversations is disjointed and nowhere near complete, being almost completely dependent on the post-war recollection of his intimates (who may also be unreliable in their recollections, especially given those circumstances). Of course, you may still get an answer to this particular question! However, broadly speaking, proving the negative is very hard (there could be an 1965 article on the topic in Swahili), and if you\\'ve asked a question which is almost certainly \"We don\\'t know, and he probably didn\\'t care anyways\", few historians familiar with the topic matter actually are going to want to put in the necessary gruntwork, doubly so about a man who on a personal level was decidedly uninteresting.

A LOT more can be said on the matter of course, regarding economic, sociopolitical, and ideological debates on the rivalry, so I would recommend a good bit of prior reading so you can ask a more specific question on the causes of the Cold War.',\n",
       " 'Hi. So just to preface this: suicide and attitudes towards suicide are certainly not a subject specialism of mine, so it might be the case that this is indeed based on an historical event that I am just not aware of, and if that is the case then I would be glad if someone more knowledgeable than myself could correct me or clarify my thoughts. But with that in mind: I’m unaware of any “epidemic” of young girls committing suicide in 5th-4th century Athens as Dr Jung suggests. My guess is that perhaps Jung may have either misunderstood some detail in the ancient literature (which I’ll explain below), or has made an anachronistic mistake and is referring to an event from a later period that I am unaware of. But since he specifically mentioned “four or five hundred years” BC I thought I could briefly explain attitudes to suicide in Ancient Athens in the fifth and fourth centuries BC, and why this story is very unlikely based on how victims of suicide were perceived and treated both culturally and legally. The main emphasis of this story is the desecration of the young girl’s body by displaying her naked publicly as a deterrent. Publicly exposing the bodies of criminals was indeed a practice used by the Athenians, a specific pit in Athens called the Barathron was used as the spot for condemned criminals to be disposed of. This state sanctioned condemnation of the body was important: not only were the proper funeral rites for the dead not performed for the criminal, but it also symbolically ensured that the “pollution” they had caused by committing such a heinous crime was physically removed from the city itself and disposed of (more on this below). More specific to Jung’s anecdote, Plato (Laws, 871D) when discussing different forms of crimes and applicable punishments suggests that people who had committed a murder against their own kin (which the Greeks regarded as worse than other murder) should be executed and their bodies thrown out naked in a crossroads outside of the city limits. Though Plato is theorising about justice he is very likely using Athenian law as the basis of his ideas. So as you can see a specific punishment for criminals condemned of capital offences could include publicly humiliating the condemn’s body by leaving it naked and exposed without the proper funeral rites having been performed. So far Jung’s anecdote is not completely out of the bounds of possibility, but of course we are dealing with suicide victims, not murderers or criminals. And though suicide was a serious taboo, for the Ancient Greeks there seems to have been a very clear and important distinction to make between the two. For example, we are told by Plutarch (Themistocles, 22) that in the Barathron “public officers cast out the bodies of those who have been put to death, and carry forth the garments and nooses of those who have dispatched themselves by hanging”. This detail is incredibly important because Plutarch distinguishes between the bodies of the criminals and the objects of the suicide victims being disposed of. For the Greeks any sort of violent death, whether that be murder, war or suicide appears to have been considered to cause a “pollution”, Robert Parker defined this pollution as “a kind of institution, the metaphysical justification for a set of conventional responses of life through violent death” (1983, pp. 120). For the Greeks when a violent death occurs the pollution must be driven out through religious purification - this explains why the body of a murderer for example is thrown in the Barathron, as a way of ridding themselves of this polluter. But Plutarch’s point suggests that a victim of suicide was themselves not considered the polluter, but instead the object with which they took their own life. We see this elsewhere in Greek literature, for example Timachidas of Lindos tells us of a corpse found hanging in a temple of Athena in Rhodes: to clear the pollution the oracle of Delphi told the priests to replace the roof beams that the victim used to hang themselves with to purify the temple again. This distinction of pollution is incredibly important: it essentially means the suicide victim is considered (largely) blameless, and hence why the victim themselves is not polluted. We see this a lot in Greek Tragedy also where suicides are a common denouement to the story: tragic heroes and heroines such as Ajax and Jocasta kill themselves to escape very human issues such as social ridicule, loss of honour, regret over their previous crimes etc. - and the audience is asked to pity - not revile - their actions. So with this in mind, it would be incredibly unlikely that the poor girl who committed suicide would be so publicly shamed and ridiculed. Though of course suicide was a taboo and looked down upon by most writers who discuss it, the historical evidence seems to suggest that the victim was considered innocent and the body of a suicide victim would not be desecrated. There is one exception to this; and that is a speech given by the statesman Aeschines, where he mentions off-hand that “when sticks and stones and iron, voiceless and senseless things, fall on any one and kill him, we cast them beyond the borders - and when a man kills himself, the hand that did the deed is buried apart from the body”. (Against Ctesiphon, 244) Which seems to suggest that the hand of a suicide victim would be cut off during burial as this was considered the polluter. This is the only reference to this practice that we have, and so it’s not clear how widespread this practice was, but even in this you can still see that Aeschines makes a clear distinction between the hand itself and the individual by comparing it to inanimate objects - the victim themself is still blameless. To further prove how unlikely Jung’s anecdote would be: Plato tells us that before Socrates took his own life by drinking hemlock, a punishment he was forced into by the Athenian courts, he took a bath to spare the women who would tend to his body the trouble of it later. Socrates seems to have expected that he would be given proper funeral rites after his death. So clearly even institutional suicide (i.e suicide as a form of punishment by the state) was still regarded as suicide and not as execution, and they will not receive the same fate as other criminals executed by the state. The only thing I can think of that may validate Jung’s anecdote is whether this was an extreme exception taken by the Areopagus in a time of crisis. As I said I am unaware of any “epidemic” of such a kind in Athens in the fifth or fourth centuries, but we are told by Lysias, when recounting the horrors of the government of the Thirty Tyrants in 403 BC, that they banned those who they executed or forced into suicide from being given funeral honours (Lysias, Against Eratosthenes 12.96). This is the only comparable time I can think of where a suicide victim was denied funeral rites, but this was an extreme exception and Lysias uses this as proof of the government’s ruthlessness, suggesting suicide victims are never normally treated this way. So to sum up: I’m unaware of any period in the fifth-fourth centuries BC in Athens where an epidemic of suicides occurred, nor would the treatment of the victim’s body be in-line with contemporary attitudes to suicide victims nor legal punishments for those who committed suicide. As I said at the beginning, my guess is Jung may have misunderstood something he read on Ancient Greece, is presenting an apocryphal story, or he’s relating a different period or an event that’s just out of my area of expertise! Hope this helps! Parker, R. “Miasma: Pollution and Purification in Early Greek Religion”, Oxford. Garrison, E.

       " 'I can answer to the terrible. In Russian, he is known as Иван Грозный (Ivan Grozny). Grozny does mean terrible, but not in the sense of really bad. More is the sense of terror- and awe- inspiring. Think “I am Oz, the great and terrible.” I’ve seen it also translated as fearsome or even formidable. (Incidentally, that is also why the capital of Chechnya is called Grozny. It was originally a fort and part of an effort to take control of the region by Russia in the 19th century, an effort that including ethnic cleaning and quite a bit of deliberate terror-inspiring, as reflected in the name of the fort). Why Ivan would be considered terror-inspiring/fearsome/formidable, or even great and terrible is clear. He started off as an abused child puppet by powerful nobles. He ended up doubling Russia’s territory and building himself a central authority and powerful throne, the first Tsar of all the Russia’s, and he did it with the blood of many. During his reign, he broke away from the Mongols/Tatars, centralised power at the expense of the nobles, violently subordinated previously independent city states and regions, and conducted a campaign of violence in support of the latter. He is said to killed his eldest son in a fit of rage, he saw poisoners and plotters everywhere, and formed the infamous oprichnina, a private army who wore all black and had on their horses dog’s heads and a brooms, as a symbol that they would bite and then sweep all opposition away (he also executed the head of the oprochina). He had a temper too, and stories about him often involve a murder and vicious punishment. He lost the Livonian War after 25 years, and caused famine and depopulation in doing so. He was also a learned man, with a library considered now a lost treasure, and for which treasure-hunters sometimes still seek. He introduced and codified new laws, including, for the first time, the punishment of imprisonment as an alternative to corporal punishment. Ivan even looked the part - reportedly tall and strong (In 1963, archaeologists opened his grave and found he was about 178 cm talk and weighed 85 to 90 kg). To add to the image, he carried a heavy staff that Daniel Prinz von Buchau, an envoy of the Holy Roman Empire to Ivan IV’s court, said symbolised the tsar’s “imposing manhood.” Overall, the kind of person who would make an impression, but also terrify. As for when he got the name, that is not entirely clear. One version says that, on his birthday, a great thunderstorm struck Moscow, the likes of which had not been seen for many years. The storm was associated with his fearsome majesty. There do not appear to be any sources confirming this (there are very few primary sources at all for his reign, as compared to his stature within history now). Another version says that Russian people began calling him the fearsome after his death, as a compliment, in respect to his strength and power, as compared to the weak rulers, wars and the so-called “Time of Troubles” that followed his death. The third version is that he acquired the name informally while alive and it was reenforced and spread after his death, but mostly as a reflection of the deaths he caused and as a negative name.',\n",
       " 'There\\'s a bit of a discussion to be had about \"Intramural\" violence in Medieval and Renaissance Italian cities, which I touched upon in this older answer which might interest you. One of the points of the answer I linked above aims to bring across is that conflict resolution was a serious and complicated thing in Renaissance Italy. Tensions between families, factions, and social categories could and did devolve into violent confrontations, but significant thought and energy went into making sure this was avoided where possible. While intramural conflicts could potentially devolve into full-scale military-style confrontations, more commonly they took the form of smaller-scale affairs more aligned with our conception of individual vendettas. Outside of popular revolt or wide-scale intramural conflict, the public use of weapons was often reserved for specific purposes, to settle specific scores, and to achieve specific goals. Violence, when it occurred, was destabilizing and scorned; while it was sometimes unavoidable, it was not encouraged. This is why legitimization of public violence was immeasurably important to Renaissance Italians, and it was predictably easier to garner understanding of a single act of violence caused by specific points of contention than it would be to justify an ongoing feud against a whole group of people (although complicating the matter is the altogether common phenomenon whereby a few people accrued enmity in their role as leaders of a group or category of people). But even when conflicts were seen as legitimate and unavoidable, social pressures were nonetheless strongly in favor of peaceful resolution, and indeed public resolution of legitimate wrongs was a major function of the Communal Governments of Italy. In other words, Medieval Italians did not want tempers to seethe to the point where they had to walk around armed. So in a world where there is no Shakespeare but only dusty historians, before \"Ancient grudge breaks to new mutiny\" the neighbors would have dragged old Montague and Capulet in front of Prince Escalus (pretending he is also not fictional) and have them come to terms before publicly signing some sort of agreement (or alternatively but less probably, the conflict would have spread and consumed the whole of the city until one side was destroyed or fled). What this also means is that unless there were two factions openly warring with each other and setting out for blood (granted we do not know the details of the fictional conflict between Montagues and Capulets, and cannot say if this would be the case) Romeo, Mercutio, and Tybalt\\'s real-life counterparts would probably have not been walking around Verona while conspicuously armed. Indeed, in the play I had always assumed they \"fought\" with rapiers (but don\\'t remember if this is ever specifically mentioned in the text) which is a very 16th/17th century sidearm, and not what Medieval or Renaissance Italians used to commit murder: murder by clubbing or dagger appears much more often than a theatric sword duel. Further, in keeping with the fact that where possible peers pressured feuding parties into peaceful resolutions, feuds ending in murder were often only those with political or social implications: the lynch mob or death while imprisoned appear more often than a dramatic fight to the death in a public place. In other words, while the feud as described in Romeo and Juliet could sensibly warrant moving about while armed, Medieval and Renaissance Italians did not feud in that way. While this doesn\\'t mean that absolutely no one was armed in Medieval and Renaissance Italy (it might be advisable, for example, for people to be armed while traveling outside the city, while moving about at night, or why not, during the improbable but not impossible kind of conflict described in Romeo and Juliet) people would not be expected to carry weapons in places where they felt safe, especially (as would be common and expected) if moving about in groups: you do see accounts of people defending themselves from would-be-assassinations with daggers tossed or handed to them by a companion who just so happened to bring one along. This signals not only that these people had felt safe enough to move about unarmed, but also that their companion, not being the target of the would-be-assassination (remember the precarious legitimacy of who can be targeted by violence!) felt safe enough to toss their weapon to a friend in need.',\n",
       " 'I\\'m going to start my answer by clarifying a few of your statements: how chivalric are the knights in question, what period of the medieval era are we talking about, what region of Europe, what is a \"medieval knight\", what do we mean by \\'honourable\\', and the context of the fight. Firstly; how chivalric are these knights, and what does chivalry mean to them? First things first, we need to acknowledge the fact that, more often than not, Knights were not very good at sticking to whatever chivalric code they acknowledged when push came to shove. We have many primary source accounts that describe the lassitude of knights towards their chivalric obligations... and far fewer of those knights who stuck to their chivalric guns (or arming swords) to the bitter end. (The only historical example I can think of of the classical \\'chivalrous knightly combat\\' are accounts of The Combat of the Thirty.) The more closely we look into history, the more clearly shall we perceive that the system of chivalry is an invention almost entirely poetical... It is always represented as distant from us both in time and place, and whilst the contemporary historians give us a clear, detailed, and complete account of the vices of the court and the great, of the ferocity or corruption of the nobles, and of the servility of the people, we are astonished to find the poets, after a long lapse of time, adorning the very same ages with the most splendid fictions of grace, virtue, and loyalty. Jean Charles Leonard de Sismondi (1885-88), Historical View of the Literatures of the South of Europe, p.79. We also need to note that the basic code of chivalry is, largely, an informal code - and is not clearly defined in any sense. Rather, our notions of chivalry are a Frankenstein of three primary source accounts (Ordene de chevalerie, anonymous, ~1220. Libre del ordre de cavayleria, Ramon Llull, ~1270. Livre de Chevalerie, Geoffroi de Charny, ~1340) combined with later clarification by scholars who attempted to codify the concept when, really, it had never been. (Leon Gautier, \\'10 Chivalric Commandments\\', which he laid out in Chivalry, 1891.) So what are the particular chivalric values these knights hold too? Let\\'s assume that these knights follow the virtues that are most popularly described as chivalric in primary sources - faith, service, prowess, courage/valour/elan, fairness, mercy - and are paragons of chivalric virtue. (An almost mythic concept.) There\\'s an instinct in popular history to bucket all of medieval Europe together both in space and time. This couldn\\'t be further from the truth: Europe was a melting pot of countless cultures and traditions, and even shared trans-cultural beliefs like \\'chivalry\\' were often interpreted very differently \\'the next town over\\'. So let\\'s assume the fight in question is occurring in a region and time that conforms well to the popular perceptions of knighthood, chivalry, and knightly duels: the early 14th century in northern France. Now, let\\'s define a knight. This may seem pedantry, but what is defined as a \"knight\" has a pretty wide range and has undergone multiple shifts throughout the centuries. While previously a Knight was essentially just a military office granted by a lord generally associated with mounted, armoured, warriors - by this time the idea of a knight had clarified into a noble rank with an associated privilege, closely tied to the chivalric code of honour. Are the knights in question a member of an Order of Chivalry/Monastic Order such as the Order of the Holy Ghost? This could effect their approach to the situation. Are the knights in question bachelors (fighting under another\\'s banner) or bannerets (fighting for themselves) - and do they hold other titles? The questions of surrender and responsibility become much greater when your death could lead to disputes of land, or title. Lets keep it as simple as possible by assuming these two knights are bannerets with only minor land holdings and have no other titles and have taken no orders. \"Honourable\" was actually a fairly malleable concept, and varied greatly by context and circumstance. What was honourable in times of peace often wasn\\'t during times of war. Additionally - conduct that would be considered reasonable in a duel of justice or honour would probably not be so acceptable during a chivalric hastilude (a martial game). But you\\'ve specified this fight is for risk of capture and ransom, which implies wartime conditions; so let us say this duel is occurring \"on the field\"; and there are no urgent orders or objectives to pursue during the battle asides from pummelling each other into submission. ( Clifford J. Rogers, Kelly DeVries and John Franc. Journal of Medieval Military History: Volumes VII-VIII) Finally, we have to consider how they were fighting. Primarily: is this duel on horseback, or on foot - and how formalized is the duel in question? Have conditions been set and agreed upon (as was the most common case for formal duels)? I\\'m going to assume this fight - being, as implied, a wartime affair - was unconditional... as otherwise the question would be a very easy one to answer: \"whatever the terms under the conditions of the duel allow\". I\\'m also going to assume the fight is, as would be the most common situation in wartime, on horseback but could very well end on the ground. Now we can actually start to answer the initial question with all of our clarifications in place. May the fight between our two hypothetical chivalric knights at war in 14th century northern France commence! Citations for the following are: - Clifford J. Rogers, Kelly DeVries and John Franc. Journal of Medieval Military History: Volumes VI-VIII - John Ellis. Cavalry: The History of Mounted Warfare. - Ken Mondschein. The Knightly Art of Battle - Dierk Hagedorn, Bartlomiej Walczak. Gladiatoria: Medieval Armoured Combat – The 1450 Fencing Manuscript The fight is likely to start with lance passes, which was considered the best way to open a fight on horseback. And it is here we would see the first reasonable point of surrender; whichever knight was dismounted, broke their lance, lost their shield, or was otherwise disadvantaged at this point would be in a very reasonable position to surrender! This isn\\'t a game; and if neither opponent wants the fight to end in a death, they\\'d best end it as soon as possible. Even a couple of tilts would be considered a suitable display of valour by most accounts; it isn\\'t easy to charge headfirst into the tip of an approaching 9.8-foot long reinforced wooden spike aimed towards your heart or head! So if both knights survive this phase of the battle, and one has been clearly bested surrender would be appropriate. But if for whatever reason, the knights either didn\\'t begin with lances, or both lost the ability to attempt to impale each other from a safe distance - they would begin trying to impale each other from an unsafe distance. Melees, were messy, dangerous, brutal affairs. This phase of the fight would generally involve trying to dismount the opponent. Killing an enemy in full plate is difficult at the best of times: far more so when you\\'re both on horse. Generally, a knight would be dismounted in melee well before they were killed or captured. Dismounting generally happened quickly once a melee commenced, and this would be a likely point of surrender - fighting someone on horseback when you are not is an immense disadvantage, and only an exceedingly brave individual would attempt it if they had surrender and survival in mind. Beyond that; forceful dismounting often caused injury. Finally, somehow, both knights have wound up without a horse and still wanting to tussle. If medieval fighting manuals are any indication, fights of this fashion assumed both opponents were going to at least be trying to kill each other. There\\'s not much mention of techniques that were designed to subdue. But these are very chivalric knights, neither of whom have blood on their mind. We\\'d expect one of a few things to provoke a surrender here; a disarming, a wound, exhaustion, an overturning (obviously outmatched or placed in an unwinnable position), or a pin. Generally, if you could do one of these things you have displayed enough of a differential in skill (or luck), that there is nothing more to prove. Someone who wanted to surrender would have no reason to keep fighting at this point if they had a reasonable expectation that it would be accepted. Remember; there is no defined \\'point of surrender\\' in most chivalric codes... you simply have to have shown sufficient valour, and a chivalrous opponent is expected to be merciful. As for what surrender would look like? You can\\'t really \\'choose\\' how you\\'d surrender in most circumstances; trying to clearly annunciate anything but a grunting plea when you are exhausted and pinned under the weight of a full grown knight in heavy Armor with a knife trying to find gaps in your armour would be quite a challenge. Since there is no formalized conduct as to how to surrender in most chivalric writing, we can assume the expectation was: however you can.',\n",
       " 'The tenth century saw a revival of Byzantine military manuals, which gives us an insight into how the army commanders thought about warfare. For example, there are a succession of these army manuals starting from about the 950s to the 1000s AD that cover the use of large hollow square formations. In order these are the Sylloge Tactictorum (c. 950 AD) , the Praecepta Militaria (c. 965 AD), the Tactica of Nikephoros Ouranos (c. 1000 AD). Infantry versus Cavalry: The Byzantine Response by Eric McGeer. Some passages are verbatim quotes of the earlier manuals, however, what I find fascinating is that other passages have been edited with newer tactics. For example, the later Praecepta Miltiaria describes keeping the pikemen (menuvlatoi) close to the front line of spearmen (hoplites - no tactical relation to the ancient Greek hoplites aside from both having shields) where the Sylloge describes keeping them separate. These slight changes lend credence to the idea that these manuals were actually used and refined through periods of loss, such as in the early 950s soon after the Sylloge was written. It is possibly worth providing the context that the Praecepta Militaria was a military manual likely edited together from the notes of the mid-tenth century general, Nikephoros Phokas, in 965 AD. The intervening 15 years (or so) had seen a very positive reversal in Byzantine fortunes, which had swept Nikephoros to the throne in 963 AD and his sponsorship as emperor led to the wide publication of the Praecepta Militaria. This has been a very wordy way of saying that Nikephoros was a very competent general who cared deeply about military literature and that we should pay attention to his writings and writings that he\\'s sponsored. Near the beginning of the Praecepta Militaria, the following quote is provided that relates to the usage of ancient formations in current times: \"The heavy infantrymen must be deployed two deep in a double faced formation, and keep two infantrymen in front and two in the back. Between them are three light archers, so that the depth of the formation is seven men. We do find the ancient Macedonians making their phalanx sixteen men deep, occasionally twelve or ten. But because their adversaries were borne by elephants with wild beasts set loose among their formations, as we find the Ethiopians did against Alexander the Great, they also employed other methods in their wars in addition to these and for these reasons made use of such formations. In our own day, however, such formations are no longer employed and this type of phalanx is impractical. When compared with the wars of the ancients, even the offspring of Hagar have greatly reduced the depth of their formations. \" Chapter 1, lines 63-74, Page 17 of Sowing the Dragon\\'s Teeth by Prof. Eric McGeer What is interesting here is that Alexander the Great did encounter elephants, they weren\\'t the primary threat he faced when using his deep pike formations against Achaemenid Persia. It\\'s difficult to highlight an absence of evidence, however, another manual published under (or soon after the death of) Nikephoros II Phokas, called On Skirmishing, makes no reference to earlier tactics and strategies, instead keeping to very contemporary approaches of tracking the enemy, working out their size and force composition, shadowing them, and either attacking smaller raiding parties or forcing the invading force to not send out raiding parties at all. Three Byzantine Treaties, George T. Dennis In conclusion, the generals of tenth century Byzantium broadly knew of the different approaches that had been used and intentionally dismissed them in favour of novel tactics that earlier Roman and Greek armies hadn\\'t used. This reflects the much more constant state of border warfare and raiding in Anatolia and so the focus on cavalry as the offensive arm of the military with the infantry being used in a much more defensive role. &#x200B; Sources: Infantry versus Cavalry: The Byzantine Response by Eric McGeer Chapter 1, lines 63-74, Page 17 of Sowing the Dragon\\'s Teeth by Prof. Eric McGeer Three Byzantine Treaties by George T.

       " 'Unfortunately I won\\'t be able to go into the Byzantine Empire\\'s rich literary, architectural or scientific history and I hope there are some additional answers that explore this in more depth then I am able. That being said, I am familiar with Byzantine military traditions of the early and middle Medieval period and hope to illustrate how Byzantine generals thought about the past. I would like to start by clarifying that those who lived in the Medieval period did not see themselves as inferior to their ancient predecessors. Their view of the past wasn\\'t that progress was lost and had to be restored, but that they were the beneficiaries of a grand history that allowed them to move further and see farther than any who came before them. The following quote attributed to Bernard of Chartres by John of Salisbury is a great example of this: We are like dwarves seated on the shoulders of giants, and thus we are able to see more and farther than the latter. And this is not at all because of the acuteness of our sight or the stature of our body, but because we are carried aloft and elevated by the magnitude of the giants. Two point are fascinating about this quote, first, the acknowledgment of the incredible contributions to their world that the Roman giants made, and second, that they can see farther and stand taller than their predecessors. The modern notion that the people of the Medieval period were backwards or inferior is just that: a modern notion. The individuals actually living in the Medieval period did not see the world this way. While they understood the impact of the ancient Roman civilization on their own world, they saw themselves as continuing the legacy forward. We can see a similar sentiment among the Byzantine military sources I am familiar with. The authors are aware of the massive empire and powerful military of their ancient ancestors, both Greeks and Romans, but are focused on present problems, available resources, enemies, and circumstances. What worked for the ancients was not always relevant to their current situation. Here\\'s a passage by Nikephoros Phokas reflecting on infantry formations in the 10th century CE: The heavy infantrymen must be deployed two deep in a double-faced formation, and keep two infantrymen in from and two in the back. Between them are three light archers, so that the depth of the formation is seven men. We do find the ancient Macedonians making their phalanx sixteen men deep, occasionally twelve or ten. But because their adversaries were borne by elephants with wild beasts set loose among their formations, as we find the Ethiopians did against Alexander the Great, they also employed other methods in their wars in addition to these and for these reasons made use of such formations. In our own day, however, such formations are no longer employed and this type of phalanx is impractical. When compared with the wars of the ancients, even the offspring of Hagar have greatly reduced the depth of their formations. An anonymous treatise on strategy from the same general time period echoes this position: some learnings from the past are valuable, others are obsolete: There are four principal ways in which men have fought one another in the past. They have waged war on foot, on horseback, in chariots, and on elephants. In these pages we shall not bother to discuss fighting with elephants and chariots. Why talk about them when even the terminology for their tactics has become obsolete? It is on the infantry and the cavalry forces, as they are each called, that we shall concentrate. When we look at an earlier 7th century source, the Strategikon of Maurice, where the military situation of the empire is in a much worse state, Maurice begins by admitting that \"the state of the armed forces has been neglected for a long time and has fallen so completely into oblivion, so to speak, that those who assume the command of troops do not understand even the most obvious matters.\" He goes on to say they make no attempt to improve upon the system of the Ancients, as evident by their grand conquests, however, the text describes tactics, equipment, formations, and training relevant to his current period. He admires his ancestors for their success, but the text is focused on the task at hand, not attempting to recreate an ancient phalanx or legion. That being said, there is one point that is consistent from the Roman Republic all the way through the 10th century military manuals I\\'ve been quoting: the fortified camp. Having a specific, organized and consistent camp layout is something that absolutely shows up time and time again. Of course having a fortified camp is by no means unique to the Romans or Byzantines, but this is one facet of Roman military dogma that stood the test of time and remained relatively unchanged for a millennia or more.',\n",
       " \"I'm not aware of any law in the three kingdoms or the Latter Han (my area of knowledge, hopefully, others from others eras can answer for theirs) to stop an Emperor from refusing a harem but then, it would have been so against the norm that I'm not sure it would have even been thought of as a potential problem. It was certainly possible to restrict a harem size using ancient examples (though I can more think of ministers doing or trying to do then Emperors) or to bring down the numbers as a political or finical move. As the Son of Heaven, changing things is possible and one could use political capital on this, to go against traditions, but it would probably prove very problematic. It was expected to have concubines and I want to show the problem would be for an Emperor that considered going against it. It should be noted an Empress wasn't always the first wife or lover, she might (though certainly not always) be one of the first of the harem. If he were young, the Empress was to be chosen for him as a suitable candidate, probably one who would help cement the regencies control and if they didn't, it might not send a great signal about their intentions for the Emperor. If the Emperor was old enough (and the Empress died via natural causes/was killed by order of the Emperor) to select his own... he still might not have the final say. Political pressure could shield an Empress that an Emperor wanted gone (Sun Hao and Lady Teng), block the desired choice of Empress (Sun Quan and Lady Bu with court wanting Lady Xu) or force an Emperor to select one he didn't want (Emperor Huan wanted Tian Sheng, he got Dou Miao). If he were old enough, he would have concubines already and if he were a young Emperor, the Dowager and her relatives will have set up a harem (to distract him with pleasures of the flesh so they could keep power) to start the process of an heir. If, in strange circumstances, this had not happened then it could be used as leverage as the young Emperor Xian (last of the Latter Han) did to get his mother honoured as an Empress by his controlling military junta. It was difficult enough for the Han and three kingdoms Emperors to have adult heirs. Emperor Zhang, the third of the Han Emperors, was the last to not come in power under a regency of some kind. Every non-founding Emperor of the three kingdoms bar Sun Hao, Wu's last Emperor in a desperate throw of the dice over the young heir Sun Wan, had some sort of regency placed on them as they were either children or teenagers. Emperors tended to die young, leaving either a child or the Dowager needing to select someone which was usually a youngster. So why not later on if the Emperor wished to have just his wife (and if in the rare and fortunate position, in that era, of the Empress actually having a child)? He has no interest in the tantric and other love making practices that might lead to long life and has no particular interest in concubines (which did happen sometimes) How confident is he in his children surviving? It was a big problem for Emperors, Emperor Ling had his children take away from the palace to try to keep them alive due to history of young deaths with so many predecessors dying without a living heir. Sun Quan the founding ruler of Wu lost, via death or exile, the first four of his sons that we know of. Infant mortality, the uncertainty of fate, political wrangling could all claim the lives or ruin suitability to be the heir. The Son of Heaven will need a few sons, cross his fingers he lived long enough for more than one to be old enough (in case the eldest is unsuited) to ensure a smooth succession and there is no guarantee the Empress children will be that lucky. Or even the concubine's brood. It is putting a lot of hope on one partnership. What about the political consequences? As slimming down the harem did happen sometimes, sending ladies back home where they could be rewed wouldn't be unknown even if the family might not be too thrilled. Senior concubines, however, could well be from influential families who hoped to benefit from the imperial connection. Those members of the court and local powerful figures might not exactly be too enamored with the Emperor for sending their sister/daughter/niece back home. With only the Emperor, the wife and the children to look after in the palace, questions might be asked about if he should get a reduction in the number of eunuchs, his castrated servants. The eunuchs were important allies and a shield against powerful figures at court and the gentry, allies who helped many an Emperor try to overthrow an overpowerful subject. Or, should he die and a regency is required, to help the Dowager. The Empress might benefit from a lack of harem trying to bring her down but she also loses one of her important jobs, managing the harem as part of managing the household. The royal couple would risk accusations that would undermine the authority of the Emperor, that the relationship was out of balance, that he was under her thumb throwing Yin and Yang out of balance so endangering the state, that was the latest Daji or other bad female bringing down dynasty stereotype. It would throw the balance of the Emperor's body and his health There was an established principle that the ideal amount of wives for an Emperor was twelve (though harems tended to be much larger in practice with several ranks of grading). Twelve was the months granted by Heaven, the Son of Heaven reflected that and some scholars preferred nine to reflect the nine divisions of the land under Heaven. The Emperor is the Son of Heaven, ritual including the power of symbolism to mirror the heavens, keep the mandate and the balance. Wander off that, the Heavens would send omens, or if Heaven wasn't so considerate as to do so, scholars might make one up to justify sending in a memorial. Every problem, every natural disaster, every negative omen, every mild cold for the Emperor would risk being traced back to the Emperor breaking from the well-set principles from ancient times and having just one lady, of throwing the balance and angering the heavens, of yang being too strong and dominating the Emperor's yin. So an Emperor could go down this route but it would go against tradition, against the way things were thought should be done, raise questions about the Emperor and the Empress, risk alienation from members of the court. Emperors sometimes did go against the grain but with a purpose that, for the Emperor, was worth the political capital being used on it. Would disbanding the harem be worth that cost?

The Constitution was, necessarily, \\'incomplete.\\' It is only a skeleton describing a government, and such a skeleton is by necessity rather \\'bare bones\\' if you will.

As regards the Bill of Rights, they did not want to list certain rights so that others, not listed, would also be protected.

       " '“The company of women is a dangerous thing, for by it the old devil has led many from the straight path to Paradise.” So says one chapter of the Templar Rule - so officially no, there were definitely no Templar women. The Rule also notes that it is dangerous enough to even look at a woman, much less kiss or hug one, even if she’s a relative. However, the chapter above also mentions that “henceforth, let not ladies be admitted as sisters into the house of the Temple; the is why, very dear brothers, henceforth it is not fitting to follow this custom, that the flower of chastity is always maintained among you.” This must mean that in the first decade of the Order, women were allowed to join. In 1129 the Order was formalized into a proper monastic order with a Rule and, apparently, women were prohibited from joining. In this way the Templars were visibly different from the other military orders, such as the Hospitallers and later the Teutonic Order, which did allow women to join in limited capacities as “helper sisters”. Of course they weren’t allowed to fight on horseback like knights, but in the Hospitaller order they took care of the sick and injured, and they also cooked, cleaned, did laundry, etc - things that women were stereotypically supposed to do in medieval society, and men were not supposed to do. If they lived with the male members, then they had their own convent buildings, typically some distance away from the men to avoid any improper mixing (and breaking of vows of chastity). In the Templar order, it turned out to be a bit impractical to avoid women entirely, and no one really seems to have cared when the Rule was sometimes bent or broken. Women could join if they simply wanted to live a life of prayer and contemplation, and maybe a Templar convent was the nearest available place or they had some other connection to it. Women could join especially if they were elderly, or perhaps if they were the widow of a deceased Templar knight - this probably meant that husbands and wives could join the Order at the same time (otherwise the husband would have to abandon his wife). Sometimes there were enough Templar women in one place that they had their own separate houses. You mentioned Mühlen, but actually in that case, their convent had previously been associated with the Cistercians. In 1272 they asked to switch their association to the nearby Templar convent - so they had become nuns in one order and later switched to the Templars, rather than joining the Templars as novices. Templar commanders who were involved in higher-level diplomacy and negotiations couldn’t avoid women either. Wealthy and powerful women sometimes donated land or money to the Order. Eleanor of Aquitaine, for example, granted the Templars houses, land, and trade privileges in the important port of La Rochelle on the Atlantic coast of France. If they really had to avoid all women, they wouldn’t have been able to negotiate transactions like this. Nevertheless, the Templars were known for avoiding women, and some people did think that was a little suspicious. In the early 14th century, the Templars were all arrested and the Order was eventually disbanded entirely. Essentially the Order was accused of “institutional homosexuality”. According to the confessions made by knights who had been arrested, the initiation rites for new members often included kissing each other’s bellybuttons and genitals and perhaps actual intercourse as well. In one case a knight confessed that there were women at his initiation - but he didn’t know why, and he was afraid that they were demons in disguise. These confessions were often obtained through torture, so the knights were probably telling the interrogators whatever they wanted to hear. Another knight confessed that the Templars were abusing their female members and forcing them to break their vows of chastity. This was somewhat expected for knights in medieval society; they were stereotypically lusty and even if Templars were supposed to be celibate, they were still knights and they would probably still chase after women. But if they weren’t allowed to be around women, maybe they were lusting after each other instead? So the interrogators focused on the accusations of homosexuality and apparently no one thought the accusations of raping women were worth investigating further. But this does at least show that there were a few Templar women and the no one found that too unexpected or unusual. So in short, women were officially forbidden from joining the Templar Order. There were a few who joined anyway, but the Templars were particularly known for their almost complete avoidance of women.

       " 'It depends on your definition of modern. Certainly, this has been a trope at play in Western Literature for a very long time. Obviously, everyone knows about the more famous cases in Western Literature, Viktor Frankenstein being one of the most famous cases. But while Mary Shelly certainly popularized the archetype, she definitely didn\\'t invent it. We also have both Marlowe and Goethe\\'s Faust as another archetypical example of this trope. Even as early as the 17th Century it was already something of a proverb. \"Great wits are sure to madness near allied, and thin partitions do their bounds divide,\" says the English Poet John Dryden in Absalom and Achitophel in 1681. But the idea of a link between genius and madness goes back even further, at least back to the early Roman Empire where Seneca allegedly quotes Aristotle. \"No great genius has ever existed without some touch of madness,\" says Seneca in his Tranquility of the Mind. Aristotle himself links the two in his Poetics, though the link he holds is far more distant \"Poetry demands a man with a special gift for it, or else one with a touch of madness in him.” So the idea that genius and madness are linked definitely predates the existence of modern medicine. The idea of genius being mad seems to have distinctive Aristotilean undertones, approaching his idea of the Golden Mean. Hume points out his Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding that our cultural idea of a sane person lies somewhere between the highly social idiot and the isolated genius. \"On the other hand, the mere ignorant is still more despised; nor is anything deemed a surer sign of an illiberal genius in an age and nation where the sciences flourish than to be entirely destitute of all relish for those noble entertainments. The most perfect character is supposed to lie between those extremes; retaining an equal ability and taste for books, company, and business; preserving in conversation that discernment and delicacy which arise from polite letters; and in business, that probity and accuracy which are the natural result of a just philosophy.\" Does the idea predate Aristotle? There are indications but nothing conclusive. As to the mythological examples... well there are a few shaky ones. Ovid\\'s Metamorphosis mentions the story of the famous inventor Daedalus who kills his own nephew, Perdix, in a fit of envy, though whether this constitutes madness or just sheer malice is up to interpretation. The Völundarkvitha poem from the Poetic Edda mentions some truly dark acts of revenge by the brilliant smith Wayland (or Volund, in the poem), but again, whether this is an example of a \\'Mad Genius\\' is up for interpretation. So to summarize the first part of the question, it is a very old trope in Western culture. As to whether it\\'s prevalent in nonwestern culture, I\\'d have to defer to someone with more expertise in that area.',\n",
       " 'I assume you\\'re referring to the actual geography, not the visual style of the map, in which case the simple answer is: we did that. We filled it in. We just went, \"this bit of water is going to be land now\", and we did it. But who\\'s \"we\"? How did \"we\" do that? When? Why? The simple answer raises more questions than it answers. (Although that\\'s not hard to do when it only answers one in the first place.) First, a bit on how Boston Harbor came to be: sea level rise. All those characteristically funky islands out in the harbor like my own personal favorite, Thompson Island, are the result of glaciation. Glaciers rolled over the landscape, creating drumlins (though that drumlin is in Ireland), and when they retreated and the sea level rose, the drumlin peaks remained above sea level, creating the speckling of islands It\\'s also how the Harbor and the Charles basin acquired their original, not-exactly-linear shapes. The river current and the tides didn\\'t create the harbor; it was already there. Although a quick glance at the map leaves the impression that Boston harbor was filled in only after the Revolution, that\\'s not entirely the case. A common practice in pre-Revolutionary Bostonian construction was \"wharfing out\", where you basically built a wooden wharf from planks, then filled in the area underneath the planks with logs and surrounded the entire thing with a stone seawall, which effectively let you just keep going with your wharves almost as far as you wanted. The seaward coastline of Boston was also creeping outwards on its own throughout the 18th century, mainly because of waste disposal into the harbor. To be fair, I can see why you\\'d want to pretend that wasn\\'t happening. Who wants to say that you were expanding your city using sewage? A lot of the plaques and tourist information boards around the harbor these days also imply that it began in the 19th century, so the quick glancer is in good company. There\\'s a good example of one of those tourist info-boards on the embankment between the Russia Building and the Tea Party Museum if you live anywhere in the area, but I don\\'t have a picture of it. Infuriating. The point is, Boston\\'s expansion into the harbor in the 18th century was very much chaotic and higgledy-piggledy, and primarily a result of shopkeepers and artisans looking for living and working space. Either way, though, as much as I enjoy getting to nitpick that little fact, it is true that the vast majority of the landfilling happened after the War of Independence. The first big landfill project that really took place intentionally, with official coordination, and on a large scale was the filling in of Mill Pond now the Bulfinch Triangle which is the divot out of the northernmost side of the Peninsula you can see in the images you linked In order to fill the Bulfinch Triangle, the City dug the soil it needed out of Beacon Hill and Copp\\'s Hill and dumped it in Mill Pond, as memorialized in this lithograph — I was going to say \"famously\", but I guess it\\'s not so famous if you\\'re not used to seeing it on tourist info-boards. This represented a change in who was benefiting as well as a change in methods and sources of material. The landfill operation was motivated, as before, by the need to provide housing for working class Bostonians, but now their interests were being mediated by those of the city government. And later in the century, landfill became desirable for building rail lines and industry, so it came to be supported by real-estate developers and rail companies. That is, essentially, the process that was used to fill in everywhere else since then, from Dorchester Flats to Back Bay. But, if the technology stayed essentially constant, that doesn\\'t mean that it was a straight line of \"progress\" from Mill Pond to the coastline Boston has today. It\\'s not as though there was ever a single consistent policy on what should be filled in, or when. There was also a considerable degree of pushback to landfilling, and for not unsound ecological reasons. (I am stepping out of my wheelhouse when it comes to tidal science here.) The opposition mainly arose from a theory based on the real phenomenon of \"tidal scour\", which is the idea that a harbor maintains or expands itself by the action of water scouring away the seabed. The idea was, if you fill in too much of the harbor, the remaining water is insufficient to keep effectively scouring the remaining part, and sediments will just continue to build up, shrinking the harbor further and filling in deep underwater naval routes — a sort of greenhouse effect of land formation, if you will. Agitation based on this theory actually put a stop to landfill, and to the construction of causeways that cut off flats from the ocean and thus led to its necessity, on multiple cases. In order to stop a causeway between the Shawmut Peninsula and South Boston in 1851, in fact, something quite rare happened: the Governor vetoed a bill, which was quite rare in Massachusetts at the time — it just wasn\\'t really a thing. But it happened here, even in those early days of harbor ecology activism, because in certain cases ecology did take precedence. However, when tidal scour was not perceived to be in action anymore, it left opponents of landfill with no real recourse. Back Bay was filled in for this reason: if you look at it on a map it\\'s pretty clear that it\\'s in no position to be scoured by tide or current. However, the theory of tidal scour was flawed. Tidal scour, is, again, a thing, but it was not the active force in maintaining Boston Harbor; if you remember from way back when, Boston Harbor was created by sea levels rising, and the entire 18th and 19th centuries of landfilling didn\\'t produce any noticeable shoaling in the harbor. But I think it\\'s important that the story of resistance to landfilling gets told alongside the story of the how, when, why, and all that, because it\\'s a good reminder that A) progress is not an inexorable march, if it\\'s a thing at all, and B) Boston\\'s harbor has long been a cause for political debate, much before \"Love That Dirty Water\" (which you better believe I listened to on repeat while writing this) and George H. W. Bush\\'s attacks on Dukakis\\' environmental policy. ___ This comes mostly from Gaining Ground: A History of Landmaking in Boston, by Nancy Seasholes, and Remaking Boston: An Environmental History of the City and Its Surroundings, edited by Anthony Penna and Conrad Wright.

       " 'Conception was a slightly contested subject in the medieval period. Crash course in medieval medicine: medical practice and theory was still largely philosophical and based on Galenic medicine- basically, men were thought to be \"hot, dry, and hard\" in nature and women were malformed men which were \"cold, wet, and soft.\" The menses were thought to be semen which has become malformed in the woman due to her insufficient hotness. The predominant theory on conception was that both the man and the woman would each release a \"seed\" during intercourse, the man from his sperm and the woman from her menses, which would join together in the womb. How exactly this joining happened was also slightly contentious: some literature says that the menses provided the substance and was formed by the semen to take the shape of the fetus, some say the menses don\\'t have any part in it, some say that they join together and their mingling forms the fetus. This obviously sounds strange to us, as we now understand that the menstrual cycle is associated with the absence of pregnancy, rather than the cause of pregnancy, however in the medieval period the menses were thought to be a naturally generating substance which was both life-giving and poisonous if not kept in moderation. Nearly all ailments in women were blamed on retained menses, hence the use of blood letting, as it was thought that if those toxins were not released via regular bleeding, you had to release them another way. Interestingly, they also thought that breast milk was also menses which travelled up to the breasts! Sanitary products would have consisted of rags which would have been washed and reused. I\\'m not aware of any work done on menstrual products or how they would have held it in place- unfortunately this sort of knowledge was not generally written down and these sorts of products don\\'t generally survive the passing of time. Contraception was certainly utilized- I touched on it in this post I think it\\'s important to note that in the medieval period, traditional remedies and knowledge would have been the primary form of contraceptive and so would not make their way into literature. We see some of this in the Trotula texts, a very widely transmitted 13th century gynaecological manual, which, despite its hundreds of herbal remedies for other ailments, only prescribes amulets for contraception. Most remaining textual evidence is of abortifacients, rather than preventatives, which would advertise themselves as \"restorers of menses\" however there are some that explicitly say they will end pregnancy- notably in the Antidotarium Nicolai, which contains a recipe contradatum emagogum (antidote given to induce menstrual bleeding) which overtly says that \"it draws out the menses and a fetus in the womb dies.\" This recipe may actually have been quite effective- it includes mugwort, pennyroyal, nutmeg, and laurel, all of which are now known to be abortifacients. all translations are my own Further reading: Green, Monica.

       " \"For a brief period in the late 1910s and early 1920s, the Royal Navy saw the US as its most likely opposition in a future war. Germany had been defeated and disarmed, Japan was an ally (at the time), as were France and Italy. The US was also an ally, but had a stronger navy than the European powers. It had also shown a willingness to fight over interruptions to trade, a problem for Britain. A large part of the RN's strategy for fighting a war in Europe involved economic warfare, blockading trade into the nation Britain was fighting. This might well provoke a war with America. To this end, in 1919 the Admiralty's Plans Division recommended that an officer be assigned to draw up plans for a war with the USA - though this process was cancelled a few months later following a decision by the Government that America was not to be considered an opponent, as a way to defuse arguments for a massive building program. Given that the planning process was prematurely cancelled, we don't have a precise plan. However, we do have some knowledge of British plans from the writings of senior officers and similar sources. The RN's plan centred on using the British fleet as a fleet-in-being to support a campaign against American trade in the western hemisphere. Given the sheer disparity of force between the American and Canadian armies, as well as the easier logistics for the Americans, the British plan wrote off most of Canada. There was, however, some hope that Halifax could be defended, as an additional base for cruisers to operate against trade. The RN's fleet would be moved to Bermuda. Here, it could counter any American moves, and act as a tempting target for the American fleet to attack on British terms (i.e. where British aircraft and submarines could attack it more easily). Cruisers and submarines would attack American trade from bases at Port Royal, Jamaica and St. Lucia, as well as Halifax if it was held. Other cruisers would protect Britain's trade against attacks by American ships, though it was assumed that trade with South America would largely be cut off. Forces in the Far East would be used to secure Manila in the Philippines, preventing the USN using it to attack trade or British colonies there - this would use available RN forces plus manpower drawn from India and Australia. All of this planning assumed that the British fleet would be free to cross the Atlantic and keep the war contained to the western side of the ocean. If the British fleet was occupied with a war in Europe, an American fleet might be able to head to Europe, establishing a base at a port in a European ally or siezed from a neutral power like Spain. This would allow it to crush the trade Britain depended on, or defeat the segment of the British fleet that could be spared to fight it. With this, Britain would be forced to seek peace on American terms. Fortunately for the British, though, American planners expected that the loss of Canada would be sufficient to force Britain to seek terms, and no plans had been made for operations in the Eastern Atlantic. Canada's main plan for a war with America was called Defence Scheme No. 1. It was produced by Colonel J. Sutherland 'Buster' Brown, head of the Canadian Army's intelligence section in the 1920s. It was an aggressive plan, calling for a pre-emptive strike against America. It was clear to Brown that the balance of forces in North America strongly favoured America. A prolonged war would strongly favour America as a result; Canada would not be able to hold out against an American offensive. To prevent this, Defence Scheme No. 1 required Canada to mobilise before America could, and knock out the industrial and logistical centres required for an invasion of Canada. Flying columns would cross the border as soon as war was declared, followed a few days later by larger formations. Initial targets included Spokane, Seattle and Portland in the west, Fargo, Minneapolis and Saint Paul in the centre and Albany and Portland (Maine) in the east. The plan expected that the British would pour reinforcements into Canada in the ensuing months, and so aimed to delay an invasion of Canada until those reinforcements had arrived. However, as described above, the British weren't really planning to reinforce Canada, one of the fatal flaws of the plan. Another major flaw of the plan was that American planners were expecting this sort of attack. American plans assumed that the war would begin with a British offensive into America from Canada; once this was defeated, American troops would seize Canada's Atlantic ports, especially Halifax. With the routes for British reinforcements thus closed, Canada's industrial and agricultural heartlands could be captured. Defence Scheme No. 1 would play directly into this plan, neglecting to protect ports like Halifax and focusing entirely on an offensive into America without coordinating with the British.\",\n",
       " \"This question may also receive useful answers at /r/Askanthropology. Many cultures regard shoes as profane. By throwing a shoe at President Bush, the man was showing his contempt. In a similar way, when people in Bagdad toppled the statue of Hussain, many of them then pounded the image with their shoes. This is echoed by the Islamic practice of removing one's shoes before entering a temple. Many cultures regard it as an insult to sleep with one's shoes pointed in the direction of Mecca. The soles of shoes are often seen as foul. This concept is foreign to much of the English speaking world: many European cultures regard a shoe as something that can speak to good fortune: shoes were traditionally tied to the vehicle carrying a newlywed couple in an effort to grant them good fortune. Someone leaving on a trip often had friends throw an old shoe after them for the same purpose. In addition, it was common to hide an old shoe in the wall of a new house (often near the chimney) to bestow good luck on the house and its occupants. These practices might seem extremely odd to the fellow who threw his shoe at Bush as a sign of contempt - granting him good fortune was the furthest thing from his mind. As indicated, the boundaries of cultural practices in relationship to shoes is the sort of thing that anthropologists can address.

       " 'No, there was pretty much no continuity with Byzantine institutions and administration, and surprise surprise, the economy collapsed! The Latin Empire spent its entire miserable existence begging for help from western Europe. In 1204 the French crusaders and Venice concluded a treaty where Venice was given three-eights of the Byzantine Empire, and the new emperor in Constantinople theoretically controlled the other five-eighths. The crusaders had never been able to pay for the fleet that the Venetians built to take them to Egypt, which is partly why the crusade was diverted to Constantinople in the first place, so this agreement was supposed to help repay Venice. The Venetians ended up controlling most of the islands in the Aegean and Ionian Seas, including Crete, which was an important part of the Venetian state for centuries afterwards. Venice also began looting anything that wasn’t nailed down (or even some things that were). Some Greeks remained in Latin territory but many of them fled. A few Byzantine successor states were established, including the Empire of Nicaea, the Empire of Trebizond, and the Desperate of Epirus. Nicaea wasn’t far from Constantinople, so anyone with military and administrative experience fled there. The Byzantines had a system of provinces (“themes”) with their own governors, who could govern somewhat independently, but their authority always depended on Constantinople. Governors could rebel sometimes, and there are examples of Byzantine themes breaking away from Constantinople (Cyprus in the 1180s for example), but there wasn’t really a “feudal” system. There was the emperor and the bureaucracy of the empire in Constantinople and they appointed provincial governors. Of course I hesitate to say there was a “feudal” system in the west, because there was no single system that worked the same everywhere - but the crusaders who came from France and Italy were certainly familiar with a system, where there was a relatively weak king (or emperor) and local aristocrats were relatively more powerful. Boniface, the Marquess of Montferrat, and Baldwin, Count of Flanders, were theoretically subject to the Holy Roman Emperor or the King of France, but in practise they ruled their territories more or less independently. I assume this is what most people have in mind when they think of a “feudal system”, and that’s the sort of system that was introduced in the Latin Empire as well. Baldwin became the first emperor but he didn’t really control the other five-eighths of the empire, as stipulated in the treat with Venice. There were several western-style vassal states ruled by other French crusaders, including the short-lived Kingdom of Thessalonica. and the Duchy of Athens. Baldwin ruled the area immediately around Constantinople. The religious hierarchy was also interrupted. The crusaders established a Latin church hierarchy, with a Latin patriarch of Constantinople and Latin dioceses. The Greek church wasn’t suppressed entirely, but the Greeks had to recognize the authority of the Pope in Rome. The Patriarch of Constantinople fled to Nicaea so there really was no Greek church hierarchy in Constantinople itself. Greek priests outside of Constantinople could no longer expect any support from the capital, and they were supposed to accept the authority of the Pope in Rome as well (but if they did, they risked being excommunicated by the Greek patriarch in Nicaea). So anyone who actually knew how to run the Byzantine state had fled to Nicaea or elsewhere, and the Latins came up with their own system, which didn’t work out at all. Aside from Nicaea, the Latin Empire also had another enemy to the north, Bulgaria. Emperor Baldwin was captured in battle with the Bulgarians after only a year, in 1205, and he later died in captivity. Bulgaria and Nicaea chipped away at the empire until there wasn’t much left other than Constantinople itself. By the 1230s, the Latin Empire had was isolated from the other Latin states in Greece and the Aegean. The Latins had to beg for help from the west - in 1239 they sold numerous relics to Louis IX of France for 135,000 pounds, which helped briefly. But Nicaea eventually took back Constantinople in 1261. For your last question, did they think they were restoring the Roman Empire? No, not really, because as far as Western Europeans were concerned the Roman Empire had become vacant in the 8th century and had already been restored by Charlemagne. But that didn’t prevent them from taking the time “emperor of Constantinople”, the title that westerners usually used when referring to the Byzantine Emperor (which the Byzantine Emperor of course thought was extremely offensive, since he insisted that he was the proper Roman Emperor). So, what kind of empire was this, and how could there be two empires that were both supposed to be Roman Empire? These questions also occurred to the crusaders, but their solution was…just ignore them entirely: “In the eyes of the Latin leaders of the crusade the Byzantine Empire in 1204 was not irrevocably overthrown or destroyed, but simply taken over and continued\" (Van Tricht, pg. 61) It wasn’t the empire (which was ruled by the Holy Roman Emperor), but it was still an empire, so the ruler was an emperor, and never mind the implication that there were now two “real” Roman Emperors. In the end, the Latin Empire didn’t last long enough for this to become a real problem.

       " '(The post says there are two comments but I can only see the usual one from the auto mod so I hope I am not repeating anything). This is a great question because the myth was perpetuated in later years by the fact it wasn\\'t properly addressed or talked about. For context, with the defeat of Nazi Germany, the newly established DDR created the narrative that with the help of the Red Army innocent workers and peasants were liberated from the oppression of Nazism and ready to rebuild (Aufbau) a better Germany. In this narrative, fascism had been utterly destroyed, removed, and annihilated from the newly formed nation. Saying that the working class of East Germany were innocent during the period of The Third Reich while in reality millions of Germans actively or passively supported Nazi rule created a conundrum that was purposely not addressed. As you can imagine simply stating this as fact without confronting some incredibly difficult and pertinent issues created an undercurrent of problems. With this state sponsored doctrine in tow, the DDR effectively exonerated its citizens from past wrongdoings and insisted anti-semitism or post-war fascism were problems for capitalist countries. A survey conducted in the 1960s concluded over half the population of the DDR believed they had been anti-fascists during the Nazi period. Education naturally forms the outlook of many people and looking into what they were taught gives an idea of what myths can and cannot perpetuate. On one hand, there were no efforts to give any credit to the Wehrmacht or the \"ordinary soldier\" which contributes to the myth as a whole. The history curriculum paid little credence to the Western Allies and almost entirely focussed on the Red Army and their sacrifice. The result was the resounding defeat of fascism with no quarter for feeling sympathy towards German soldiers who survived. However, on the other hand, very little attention was paid to the plight of the Jews and other racial groups subject to genocide. Memorialisation entirely focuses on Russians, other Slavic groups, or the \"martyrdom\" of key Communist figures like Ernst Thalmann. It isn\\'t until 1984 that references to six million murdered Jews were included in textbooks. Even more worrying is that textbooks actually portrayed Kristallnacht as an obvious result of capitalism and drops part of the blame at the door of German Jews. Overall there is an overarching attempt to highlight how capitalism was a constant contributing factor throughout the war such as the \"IG Farben Cartel\" which apparently organised the murder of camp inmates and insisted on experimentation. The reason this is relevant is down to the DDR\\'s poor attempt at confronting the Holocaust and the anti-semitism that compounded it. Surveys done on the eve of unification in 1990 specifically looked at xenophobia and anti-Semitism in East German society and demonstrated worryingly high levels of intolerance. In particular, young adults and teenagers were most susceptible to this (E.g. 25% of students at high school agreeing with the phrase \"The Jews Are Germany\\'s Misfortune\"), all who had gone through the East German education system. Ultimately the ways in which the DDR confronted a deep wound in society conflicted with the foundation stone of their political set up and Marxist-Leninist doctrines. With the latter triumphing over a societal need to reflect, accept, and repent, a particular form of ideology injected through a state-controlled curriculum was in charge. Although by no means did schools encourage aspects of the Wehrmacht myth themselves, they did leave issues regarding Germany\\'s past horrors and complicity in the Holocaust in the dark resulting in vulnerable young minds more open to extremist views.

       " 'This is an extremely tricky question to answer, because quite simply we do not have historical sources that talk about religious practices without some kind of input from the Roman Empire, or earlier Greek influences. Literacy, as in the relatively widespread ability to record knowledge in writing for posterity is largely an invention of the Latin Church in most of Europe, or a holdover of Roman imperial administration. Writing systems such as runes did develop, though heavily influenced by writings systems in Italy, but they were ill suited to long records and were only ever utilized by a tiny minority of the population. Indeed most rune carvings, that aren\\'t Christian (which most of them are), say very very little and more akin to epitaphs or landmarks than actual records of practices. Lets take Norse paganism as an example. We actually don\\'t know nearly as much about Norse heathenry, or paganism, as it seems at first glance. All of our contemporary and roughly contemporary sources on Norse religious practices are Christian, Latin Christian at that, writing after the end of the Roman Empire and the conversion of the former Imperial heartlands to Christiana, and thus are pretty biased against these pagans. The famous description of Norse sacrifice at Uppsala for example comes from a German bishop who had a vested interest in playing up their savagery and barbarism. The account of Ibn Fadlan of the Rus\\'s funerary practices comes long after the traditional end of the Roman empire in the west and is likewise heavily colored and difficult to take at face value. However when most people think \"Norse mythology\" they go to the sagas. These books are also pretty unreliable when trying to reconstruct pre-Christian Norse beliefs. They were only compiled centuries after conversion by a Christian society, and so they cannot be held to be the immutable truth of Norse religious practices. Furthermore they\\'re not necessarily reflective of wider beliefs in the Norse world. The version of this religion as seen in the sagas is just a fragment of one society\\'s remembrance of these traditions and practices centuries after conversion. If all of this sounds like it makes the sagas perhaps not the best source, that\\'s because they aren\\'t. Archaeology is extremely useful but very limited. It can tell us about specific figurines, pendants, burial practices, and so on, but it\\'s impossible to really construct reason and motive. It provides a solid basis for speculation, but cannot provide anything definitive. Now strip away all of those biased sources and you are left with basically what is left to historians, as far as textual evidence, for Anglo-Saxon paganism which did at least exist at the same time as the Roman Empire (so did Norse heathenry but that\\'s a separate problem with the Byzantines). The only source that even touches on possible Anglo-Saxon pagan practices is Bede in his History of the English Church and People. Much has been dissected from what he mentions. He talks about one instance where a high priest converts to Christianity, and bears arms and mounts a stallion, to destroy the temple he formerly oversaw. However efforts to reconstruct an entire system of religion from this biased mention seems a little....poorly thought out. There\\'s no reason to assume what may have held true in one specific kingdom was true of others. This hasn\\'t stopped historians from trying of course. Robert Chaney lays out some quite plausible ideas on Anglo-Saxon religion, particularly the role Kings may have played in religious life. However much of his work is outdated and under increased scrutiny. Some aspects of Anglo-Saxon beliefs can still be gleamed though. Kristopher Poole argues quite convincingly for the centrality of horses and horse consumption as a central activity in pre-Christian England. The importance of horses is also quite well attested throughout Germanic cultures, from Tacitus to the Sagas, so this is a reasonable inference, but none of this comes directly from contemporary or un-influenced sources. But, enough about Scandinavia and England, what about Egypt? Egypt was the site of an incredibly antique pagan religious tradition that stretched back to time immemorial, so what happened to it? Egypt in Late Antiquity was animated vibrant monastic traditions, intense theological debate and scholarship, and religious conflict between the rising Christian population and pagans. However the influential pagan groups of Late Antiquity were not traditions that stretched back to Pharonic Egypt, worshipping Set, Osiris, and so on. In Alexandria there were prominent cults that incorporated some native Egyptian figures like Isis, and later Hellenistic deities like Serapis, but the Isis cult was widespread in Late Antiquity, and Serapis a recent addition. There was also a large Jewish community in Alexandria with a great deal of influence and prestige attached to it. However in Late Antiquity the most influential pagan cults were Neo-Platonic groups and the mystery cults such as Mithraism and Isis worship which as I mentioned were popular across the Empire. But what about the famous gods and goddesses of Egypt that we all know and love from Age of Mythology and documentaries? Ancient Egyptian religion is stereotyped as being incredibly conservative, changing little over the millennia that it was practiced in the Nile Valley, and this is misleading. Religious changes happened in Egypt as they did anywhere else, and the practices, important deities, and cultic sites was always subject to a certain amount of ebb and flow over the course of history. In general a few things can be said, but we should acknowledge that these are generalizations. The religious practices of the Egyptians had adapted well to the intrusions of the Persians, Macedonians, and Romans following the end of native Egyptian rule for centuries by the time of Late Antiquity, but these same tradtions and practices vanished rather rapidly in the third-fourth centuries. So what happened to cause these millennia old traditions and practices to disappear so quickly? There are essentially two stories to tell here. One of the \"official religion\" that would be familiar with priests, temples, and state support, and the other is harder to describe and has to do with the rural communities that you might assume would have resisted conversion for longer than urban centers in Egypt. The institutionally supported temples and the \"Religion\" of Egypt was essentially over by the end of the Fourth Century AD, and its demise took the religious beliefs and practices of Pharaonic Egypt with it. This is because the religious traditions of pre-Hellenistic Egypt had been inexorably linked with governmental support for the temples, priesthood, and so on. Once this pipeline was shut off, the whole system collapsed on itself. In its place Christian institutions, now with state backing, quickly began to assert themselves in Egypt. This is when the temples of Amun and Ra and so on were closed either through direct state action or through lack of resources to support themselves following the withdrawal of state support. On top of this there were several waves of iconoclastic violence that demolished or severly damaged many prominent pagan temples in Egypt, both those belonging to traditional religious cults as well as more recent cults. Undoubtedly in some rural areas there were still more traditional and conservative practices going on, but in the face of Christian dominance over Egypt they eventually disappeared, having been reduced in status and importance for some time. It is extremely unlikely such \"pagan\" communities survived the end of Roman authority in Egypt, much less survived into Islamic times in Egypt. Numerous laws passed against public practice of pagan religious traditions were issued under later emperors and temples were closed, festivals ended, and Christian institutions supported in their place. It is really impossible to tell when the last household or family stopped their traditional practices and embraced, or at least accepted, the new religion sweeping the countryside, but evidence of Egyptian indigenous religious practice peters out by the 4th century in Egypt as I mentioned above. However there is a second act to this story. In the area of Philae, south of Ancient Egypt, traditional practices continued for a few more centuries following the end of the religion in Egypt proper. The temple to Isis here was only closed in the 6th century by Justinian the Great. At this point it is assumed that population assimilated into Christian practices found in Egypt proper. The idea that these practices and beliefs survived the end of Roman authority in Egypt, following either the Persian Conquest of Egypt from the Eastern Romans in the 7th century or the subsequent seizure of Egypt by Islamic forces shortly afterwards belongs in the realm of fiction.',\n",
       " \"Let's first answer your question in the narrowest sense: what exactly did Sherlock Holmes eat? This will give us a good view of meals, snacks, and eating habits, which I will expand upon below. We can look at it story by story: &#x200B; The Adventure of the Three Students There was a promise of green peas by the landlady, but Holmes and Watson arrived late and didn't have any. The Adventure of the Abbey Grange The first morning, Holmes and Watson skipped breakfast because they had to leave early. Instead, they had some hot tea at Charing Cross before boarding the train. The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet Holmes went out to investigate and took a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrust this rude meal into his pocket. The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle Holmes invites Watson to dinner. “I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe.” From this we learn that his landlady would either make some kind of menu, or tell him earlier in the day about what was for dinner. The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton Holmes and Watson had some cold supper at 9:30 before going on their mission. At various instances we learn a little about the times their meals were taken. Lunch is mentioned around 1PM, then dinner and then the cold supper at 9:30. The Adventure of the Dying Detective Holmes eats some biscuits. After the wrap-up, Holmes announced “when we have finished at the police-station I think that something nutritious at Simpson’s would not be out of place.” Simpson's is a restaurant. The Adventure of the Engineer’s Thumb For breakfast at home, Holmes and Watson have a meal of fresh rashers (bacon) and eggs. The Five Orange Pips The only mention of food is when Holmes tears a piece of bread and eats it as is, washing it down with water. The “Gloria Scott” After dinner one evening, Holmes and the Trevors were sitting down over a glass of port, cracking and eating nuts. The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter Holmes and Watson have a cold supper at the inn in Cambridge. The Naval Treaty After returning from Woking, at 3:20 p.m., Holmes has a hasty luncheon at the buffet. The next day, Holmes lunched in the dining-room at Brierbrae before setting off to London again. Also mentioned in this story is breakfast, where Mrs Hudson serves ham and eggs, curried chicken, and purloined treaty. The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor A quite epicurean little cold supper was laid out upon Holmes's table. There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a pate de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles. Holmes had ordered this from a confectioner in anticipation of being joined for supper by his noble client, the noble bachelor from the title and his bride. The Adventure of the Priory School The first morning on the case, Holmes had cocoa at breakfast. In the evening they ate at the Fighting Cock. The Red-Headed League Holmes went to hear Sarasate, a violinist, play at the St. James’s Hall, and stopped for lunch of a sandwich and a cup of coffee on the way. The Reigate Squires There was a dish of oranges and a carafe of water on a table in Mr. Cunningham’s bedroom. The oranges might have been decorative but also probably acted as a snack. The Adventure of the Retired Colourman Mention is made of Holmes having had breakfast: some toast crumbs and two empty egg shells are left at his place. A Scandal in Bohemia Some cold beef and a glass of beer are taken for lunch. The Adventure of the Second Stain In the 2 days following the murder, Holmes is described as devouring sandwiches at irregular hours. The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place Holmes and Watson catch a trout and have it for supper. The Sign of the Four After returning from the overnight quest, Holmes and Watson have breakfast consisting of ham and eggs with coffee. Silver Blaze Curried mutton is served. The Adventure of the Six Napoleons No time for breakfast but they do have coffee in the morning. The murdered man had an apple in his pocket, supposedly a snack. Holmes has a hasty luncheon at a restaurant. A Study in Scarlet Upon the 4th of March, Holmes was eating breakfast, and munched silently at his toast. Slightly later, Watson sat down at his own breakfast. It is described that he used an eggspoon so presumably had an egg. A meal is described of cold meat and bread that were leftover from an earlier supper, that are made into sandwiches. A bighorn sheep is killed and cooked, it makes enough meat to last a few days. The Problem of Thor Bridge Holmes has two improperly-cooked hard-boiled eggs for breakfast before the client’s visit. The Man with the Twisted Lip A cold supper was set for Holmes and Watson by their client when they arrived at her house late at night. The Adventure of the Veiled Lodger Before setting off to see the veiled lodger, Holmes and Watson ate some cold partridge. With the partridge, they shared a bottle of Montrachet to renew their energies.\",\n",
       " 'Hi there! You’ve asked a question along the lines of ‘why didn’t I learn about X’. We’re happy to let this question stand, but there are a variety of reasons why you may find it hard to get a good answer to this question on /r/AskHistorians. Firstly, school curricula and how they are taught vary strongly between different countries and even even different states. Additionally, how they are taught is often influenced by teachers having to compromise on how much time they can spend on any given topic. More information on your location and level of education might be helpful to answer this question. Secondly, we have noticed that these questions are often phrased to be about people\\'s individual experience but what they are really about is why a certain event is more prominent in popular narratives of history than others. Instead of asking \"Why haven\\'t I learned about event ...\", consider asking \"What importance do scholars assign to event ... in the context of such and such history?\" The latter question is often closer to what to what people actually want to know and is more likely to get a good answer from an expert.

       " \"It’s hard to say exactly how Reagan came to survive the tribulations of the Iran Contra matters and endure as a conservative icon. Malcolm Byrne, the author of what I understand to be the most recent serious scholarly work on Iran Contra (Iran Contra: Reagan’s Scandal and the Unchecked Abuse of Presidential Power) had this to say in his AMA( https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3sm68o/ama_ronald_reagan_and_the_irancontra_affair/) in response to the question “What are some of the reasons we forget about Iran Contra and idolize Reagan today?” It seems to be a fact of politics that likability matters. Nixon was not a likable guy and that hurt him in public opinion. Reagan was adored by many Americans; many others hated his policies but it was a recurring theme that anyone who met him seemed to come away liking him. When it came to Iran-Contra polls showed that most Americans didn't believe his excuses and cover stories, yet there wasn't a broad-based push for him to pay the ultimate political price -- impeachment. So personality had something to do with it. The discovery of Iran-Contra also came on the eve of the 1988 presidential election season and the Democratic leadership decided they didn't want to do anything that would allow the GOP to claim they were playing politics (naive as that sounds). So they actually dialed it back and, among other decisions, chose early on not to consider impeachment unless there was something overwhelming to indicate they should. Of course, looking back, it's clear Reagan took various steps knowing they might be violations of law, but the Democratic leadership (unlike many in the rank and file) was not willing to push the issue. Another factor is that the world moved on. Reagan went on to hold important summits with Gorbachev including signing the INF treaty. The Berlin Wall came down, George Bush got elected president, the Gulf War happened, etc., etc. By comparison Iran-Contra seemed less and less important. The republic didn't collapse! Those are some of the reasons why Reagan is largely forgiven and the scandal essentially forgotten. I’d like to focus specifically on your secondary question on whether there were any serious efforts to impeach Reagan. While Byrne alludes to impeachment, there’s plenty of room to dig deeper. The short answer is no, but it's worth looking at why. Incidentally, Byrne's book is very good and I recommend it to anyone interested in this subject. Also check out Theodore Draper's A Very Thin Line. On March 5, 1987 Henry Gonzalez (D-TX) rose in the House to introduce a resolution (H. Res. 111) comprising six articles of impeachment of Ronald Wilson Reagan. The brief AP story( https://apnews.com/article/ce090643c85cf3c1065d06427d85e1d9) on it from the time makes it clear that this was not a particularly big deal. “The articles were not expected to be approved and were not presented in a forum to be taken seriously by the House leadership. Gonzalez made his remarks at a time in which the House had concluded its official business for the day and a handful of members were making speeches. Less than a half dozen members were on the floor at the time. Articles I-V focused on what Gonzalez argued were specific contraventions of various statues by the President relating to his approval of arms shipments to Iran, violation of the Congressional ban on Contra funding, and failing to notify Congress of intelligence operations. Article VI was sort of a catch-all arguing that Reagan had “presided over a pattern of Executive actions in disregard of the laws of the United States and a pattern of casual and irresponsible Executive decision-making” The articles and Gonzalez’s remarks can be found here starting on page 4899. As the AP story notes, the House leadership was not supportive of Gonzalez so this was not a serious effort. After all, the Congressional committees investigating the matter had only been formed in January and wouldn’t hold their first public hearings until May 5( https://www.brown.edu/Research/Understanding_the_Iran_Contra_Affair/timeline-hearings.php). As is again noted by AP, Gonzalez had decided to introduce H. Res. 111 following publication of the Tower Commission report This was the first of the Iran Contra investigations and took place over only three months. Chaired by former Senator John Tower, it was specially convened by Reagan to look into the scandal (officially it was called the President’s Special Review Board). Though working on a truncated timeline, its findings were comprehensive enough to give Gonzalez a basis for his resolution. Doomed though H. Res. 111 may have been, it was not the last word on impeachment. Rep. Lee Hamilton (D. Ind), Chair of the House Committee on Iran Contra told ABC that impeachment was not off the table, but the standard for it would be if Reagan had approved the infamous diversion of profits from the Iranian arms-for-hostages scheme toward the Nicaraguan operation. The LA Times reported his comments( https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-06-15-mn-4220-story.html) thusly “Congress will probably consider impeaching President Reagan if it discovers that Reagan knew about the diversion of profits from his secret arms sales to Iran, the chairman of the House committee on the Iran- contra scandal said Sunday. If John M. Poindexter, former national security adviser, testifies next month that Reagan knew of the diversion, “It is likely . . . (that) you would have a demand for impeachment proceedings,” Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), the committee chairman, said on ABC-TV’s “This Week With David Brinkley.” Whether or not Hamilton would have actually supported impeachment had such evidence arisen is a meaningless historical what-if, but its clear that he and his colleagues went into the investigations determined not to pursue impeachment unless absolutely necessary. Byrne’s answer above has some good flavour on this, but we can certainly get more specific. In 1990, Seymour Hersh wrote a piece in the New York Times called The Iran-Contra Committees: Did They Protect Reagan?( https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/29/magazine/the-iran-contra-committees-did-they-protect-reagan.html) It looked into the Congressional investigations and the decisions that shaped them, and painted a picture of a Congress that wanted to avoid impeachment. It quotes remarks made by Iran Contra Senate Committee Chief Counsel Arthur Liman, who in 1988 said ''Even if you concluded that the President was involved in the diversion, an impeachment process has a huge price. In a nuclear age it's something that has to be used sparingly. We were all very mindful of the fact that there was an opportunity for the negotiations with the Soviet Union. We were mindful that if an impeachment process was started, that opportunity would be lost. We were mindful that this country would have been paralyzed. . . . ''So, unless you had a smoking gun - irrefutable evidence that would cause a President to resign - to have gone down that road could have sacrificed whatever opportunity there was to try to establish some new order with the Soviet Union. . . . I think it was the morally right decision that Poindexter and North, for whatever reason, refused to inculpate the President on the diversion.'' Wanting to avoid impeachment because of the toll it would take on the President during a delicate time with the Soviet Union is certainly a legitimate concern, although one has to wonder if Liman is implicitly endorsing misleading Congress with that last part. The piece has more on the impeachment question. Hersh quotes an anonymous participant describing a January 1987 Senate committee meeting reaching a consensus that no one wanted impeachment. ''We don't want to go after the President,'' the participant said. ''He was too old,'' with too little time left in office. The Senators ''honestly thought that the country didn't need another Watergate. They were urgently hoping to avoid a crisis.'' There was yet another consensus, the witness added: the President did not have the mental ability to fully understand what had happened. Hersh also quoted Vice Chair Sen. Warren B. Rudman (R. NH) offering a view very much in line with the one Hamilton had expressed to David Brinkley, namely that only Reagan’s implication with the diversion could trigger impeachment, relating that ''if there was an impeachable offense, it could only be the diversion.” So there you have it. Articles of impeachment were introduced but went nowhere, and the Congressional Committees looking into the matter didn’t want to pursue unless they absolutely had to. No one wanted another Watergate, which was still uncomfortably recent history at the time. There was concern regarding the situation with the Soviets, as well as whether it was worth going after an aging President who may not have remembered what he was doing, not to mention the points Byrne made. Any impeachment proceedings would have had to meet the high bar of proving Reagan’s involvement with the diversion of funds, and that proof never materialized. I know this doesn't address your main question, but I felt that the impeachment issue deserved some in-depth analysis, so that's where I decided to focus.\",\n",
       " 'With Nixon, his major downfalls were 1.) the Saturday Night Massacre in October 1973, and the firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox -- Nixon\\'s popularity was taking a beating already, but it dipped down and stayed at an eye-popping 27 percent. (Nixon couldn\\'t even do the firing directly -- he asked the Attorney General to do it, who refused and resigned, then asked the Deputy Attorney General to do it, who refused and resigned, so finally the third person in line -- Robert Bork, acting head of the Justice Department -- did the firing.) 2.) a tape that is now actually named the \"smoking gun\" tape, where Nixon has a conversation with H. R. Haldeman (Chief of Staff) about explicitly having the CIA interfere with the FBI investigation. This meant he knew about Watergate shortly after it happened and was involved in an attempted cover-up. This led directly to his resignation. Even without the tape, Nixon\\'s political reputation was pretty much wrecked after incident #1. Reagan never even had the opportunity to make the same Saturday Night Massacre mistake -- what happened with the Cox firing eventually led to the Ethics in Government Act (signed by Carter in 1978) which gave special rules regarding the appointment of special prosecutors, now meant to be appointed by a panel of three judges as opposed to the Department of Justice itself. The law was renewed during Reagan\\'s first term, and while his DOJ voiced objections Reagan signed the renewal. It was during this renewal period -- in December 1986 -- that Lawrence Walsh was appointed to study the allegation that a so-called \"surplus\" of money from arms sales to Iran was then \"redirected\" to fund right-wing rebels in Nicaragua. Walsh was not appointed by the Department of Justice and could only be removed for \"good cause\" -- that is, Reagan couldn\\'t just ask the DOJ to fire the special prosecutor like Nixon did. The \"smoking gun\" never happened either, mainly because Reagan never was definitively linked to the scandal. In the Congressional investigation that followed, essentially, Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North (National Security Council) took the blame, along John Poindexter (National Security Advisor). North essentially had the \"blessing\" of Poindexter and it was assumed Reagan\\'s approval; as well. Interestingly enough (and possibly, cannily enough), Reagan appointed his his own group, the Tower Commission, to do their own investigation. They concluded Reagan was not connected directly but that his management had essentially created the conditions which allowed Iran-Contra to happen. Reagan\\'s approval took a pounding, and when the scandal first broke in November 1986 his approval ratings plummeted from 67% to 46%. It\\'s not like people believed Reagan\\'s story of not being involved -- polls from the time ranged from 12 percent to 23 percent of people believing he didn\\'t know about the redirection of funds. The Democratic Congress was hostile, and the media was certainly heavily invested -- Peter Wallison, counsel for the White House, counted 555 stories in the Washington Post and 505 in the New York Times during the opening three months of the scandal. But: Reagan still managed to survive politically, and leave office with a high approval rating. For one thing, while Reagan did take an initial hit to his popularity, it stabilized; Reagan did not compound his situation with more mistakes. He took a balancing act with media and while he attacked media for bias he also welcomed reporting at the same time. Oliver North\\'s testimony also managed to be a \"hit\", so to speak; he simultaneously took blame while also implicating people higher up while on a third hand not implicating the president. Yet the buck does not stop with Admiral Poindexter, as he stated in his testimony; it stops with me. I am the one who is ultimately accountable to the American people. He gave an emotional appeal for the Iran-Contra scheme and for the \"freedom fighters\" of Nicaragua, depicting himself as a victim in a rightous cause. He was a \"defender of democracy\". 70% of those watching thought he was \"performing well\". Later polls had 67% of him as a \"true patriot\". The testimony was sufficient to deflate the Congressional committee (where some of the members, incidentally, had previously approved over-the-table aid for the Contras -- the scandal was in the diversion, not funding them in the first place). Democrats tried to claim any assessment of the President\\'s role was premature but Reagan\\'s approval rating was starting to recover. There was the direct assertion from the senior Democrat on the Senate committee that The mistakes were not only in the execution of policies. The major mistakes were in the policies themselves. And the policies were the President\\'s. but the lack of a direct criminal act to pin on Reagan made it hard to act decisively. Dick Cheney was on the House committee, and remarked If there ever was a crisis -- which I doubt -- it ended before these committees were established. Rather importantly, even while Reagan\\'s political competence was being questioned, his personal reputation was still strong. A July 1987 poll asked Apart from whether you approve or disapprove of the way Reagan is handling his job as president, what do you think of Reagan as a person? Would you say you approve or disapprove of him? which led to a whopping 72% approval. In summary: 1.) Congress didn\\'t find a criminal smoking gun to pin on Reagan 2.) Congress -- and some of the public -- was sympathetic to the character of Oliver North and the cause of funding the Contras 3.) Reagan was still well-liked enough as a person, and he managed to frame the conversation of what happened as a leadership mis-step rather than a wholesale ethics disaster ... Busby, R. .

       " 'Recent archeological studies confirmed lack of cultural continuity between Roman and Early-Medieval periods in Poland and Western Ukraine which was the final nail in the coffin of the idea that Slavs originated in Central Europe in some deep antiquity. First archeological cultures that are considered without a doubt Slavic are Prague-Korchak in North-Western Ukraine/Southern Belarus and Penkovka in North-Western and Northern Ukraine. The latter is related to Kolochin culture Kolochin was most likely Baltic, possibly Slavic and probably one of the ancestors of Penkovka, but could have also coexisted with it in its later period. Oldest signs of those cultures in North-Western Ukraine are dated around 475-500 CE. Culture that predated them in the region (Chernyakhov disappeared a hundred years prior and appeaser to have no relation to the Slavs that appeared in its placed later on. Prague-Korchak, Penkovka and possibly also Kolochin are most likely a descendants of Kiev culture from Central-Northern Ukraine/Southern Belarus that coexisted with Chernyakhov (to its north) and disappeared around the same time. The two main ones I\\'ve been harping about are so important because they are identifiable in Roman records. Prague-Korchak is identified with the Roman designations of Sclavoni/Slavs, while Penkovka as Antes who Romans describe as linguistically and culturaly identical to other Slavs, but somehow distinct. They inherit the name of one of the Alan tribes the Goths fought just before fall of their kingdom in 376 CE. That\\'s all archeology and historical records we have. Now to linguistics and then the theories that are made out of all the evidence. Early Slavic hasn\\'t started diverging into different languages till at least 1000 CE. Slavs between Laba, Upper Volga and Adriatic coast has spoken the very same language, which means it had to be developed before their VII century expansion. Now, the three distinct parts of Early Slavic are Baltic, Germanic and Iranian. Which means that the language either entirely came to be in a place where those 3 cultures coexisted or got the loan words from the \"spare ones\" very, very early. Now, if we look through the dates above we\\'ll notice that Slavs appear b1oth historically and archeologically around 475-500 CE in Western Ukraine. That is in an aftermath of the Hunic invasion. It is commonly agreed that the came from the north - deep forests and marches that covered the Baltics, Belarus and very north of Ukraine. There are two competing theories on when they formed: 1. Proto-Balto-Slavic peoples formed somewhere in Northern Belarus/Baltics perhaps as early as 2000 BC and pushed south into the vacuum created by the Huns integrated remnants of Iranian and Germanic tribes which explains the loan words present in all Slavic languages. 2. Southern groups of Proto-Baltic peoples living in Baltics/Belarus mixed with the refugees from Germanic and Iranian tribes and nations crushed by the Huns around 400 CE. That resulted in creation of a new language and culture - the Slavs. In this scenario Iranian and Germanic \"loan words\" aren\\'t \"loan words\" but an integral, albeit smaller, part along the mostly Baltic core. Either way the Slavs then descended from their forests and marches onto Ukrainian steppe and within next 200 years expanded as far west as Laba and Adriatic Sea and as far south as Peloponnese. Based on both Roman historiography and archeological evidence the conquest didn\\'t involve major exchange of population (read: the inhabitants at the time weren\\'t slaughtered), but rather cultural assimilation. I myself am a cautious proponent of the theory number two, since it seems to make more sense from both linguistic and historical point of view in the light of available evidence. Source: A.

       " 'So the simplest answer is that Japan, Italy, and Germany were the countries that signed the Tripartite Pact at its inception in 1940, forming an alliance amongst themselves that became known as “The Axis.” This built on the alliance between Italy and Germany which had been known as the Rome-Berlin Axis. Now to start getting a little more in-depth (though I’ll try not to get too technical). The question of which countries are meant by “The Axis” is a question of both the political and military ties between them, as well as the judgments of those outside of the Axis during its existence and when teaching the history afterwards. Romania and other countries like Hungary, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia did eventually join the pact and there were other countries that allied with or became co-belligerents with the initial 3 Axis powers, but the reasons for not counting them among the “Axis powers” is a judgment call based on several factors. One such factor is the agency of joining. That is: did the government of the country make a decision to join with the Axis? Now from a technical/legal standpoint the answer may be yes, but the circumstances surrounding the alliance may be such that we might consider it improper to say that the country joined of its own agency. A clear example would be Vichy France. Unlike Poland, from a legal standpoint France was de jure still an independent country under the dictatorship of Prime Minister Phillipe Pétain that aligned itself with the Germans. But de facto, France was conquered, it surrendered, and became a client state of Nazi Germany through the installation of a friendly ruler. So we don’t call France part of the Axis because whatever it says on paper, the French government did not, of its own free, willing, and voluntary agency join with the Nazis. Other countries in this boat would be Yugoslavia and Norway. We also look at the exact nature of the relationship that the non-Axis powers had with Italy, Germany, and Japan. For example, let’s look at Finland. The government of Finland voluntarily joined the Nazis as what they considered co-belligerents against the USSR. Now the line between allies and co-belligerents is largely a matter of political philosophy, but several factors differentiate the Germany-Finland relationship with the Germany-Italy, Germany-France, or Germany-Norway relationships. Finland did not join the Tripartite pact, it did not integrate its army with the German army, and it didn’t really concern itself with any aspect of WWII as a whole (at least not in any major way), it had no expansionist goals of its own, nor did it share the political ideologies of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, or Imperial Japan. Rather, Finland was a liberal democracy, wished to stay a liberal democracy, but had a common enemy with Germany in the form of the USSR, which had waged the Winter War on Finland and took important territory from it between November 1939 and March 1940. Not to mention the history between Finland and the Russian Empire. So while Finland and Germany fought together, and the preexisting government of Finland did so voluntarily, the nature of the relationship was more “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” than a proper alliance. However, after the Karelian Offensive, Finland surrendered to the Soviets and waged the Lapland War against the Germans. After the war, Finland was classified as a Nazi Ally in the Paris Peace Treaty and forced to pay reparations. But by the early 50’s those were paid and strange position of Finland during and after WWII made the narrative of Finland’s involvement in it subject to Cold War information campaigns. As a liberal democracy with rising economic power that also shared a border with the USSR, both sides of the Iron Curtain had an interest in holding diplomatic ties with Finland, while also shaming it if it got too friendly with the other. So the academic circles of both sides would throw around different analyses of Finland’s involvement depending on the political climate. Thus the politics of historical interpretation is certainly a factor, though it shouldn’t be overstated. And with that all established, now we can get to Romania, which has its own unique story that you can say falls somewhere between those other examples. That is: It was a neutral country that became pro-Axis after a coup, which became pro-Allies after another coup and after the war became occupied by an Allied power leading to the rise of its own anti-monarchy Communist government. Whew you can already see the complications. So the government Kingdom of Romania did not decide to willingly join with the Axis, but after it lost territory to the Soviets King Carol II was overthrown by an internal fascist movement (EDIT: I initially said this was done by a group called the Iron Guard, but the story is more complex than that. See u/RevAndroid’s comments below for more info). It was still a de jure kingdom under King Michael I (who had previously been king before Carol II) but was de facto a dictatorship under Ion Antonescu. Romania joined the Tripartite and became a staunch Nazi ally on the Eastern Front, and was responsible for a number of atrocities. However, the dictatorship was later overthrown by King Michael, Antonescu was ousted, and the Kingdom joined the Allies. In the Treaty of Paris, it got a similar treatment to Finland. It was recognized as an Ally of Nazi Germany and had debt for reparations imposed on it. It’s eastern territories were taken in by the Soviets, and the Soviet occupation of Romania proper helped bring about the Socialist Republic of Romania. So of course, the history became a subject of debate. The Soviets and Romanians couldn’t have this wonderful narrative of the rightful king being restored and bringing the country to the allied side. It’s too Tolkien-y and monarchist-y. They also didn’t want to mark Romania as fascist or Hitler-aligned as it was trying to maintain good diplomatic relations. And as for the West, well, let’s put it this way, the CIA was trying to support anti-communist forces in Romania and a lot of them were very much anti-semitic fascists, which still gets downplayed. So any narrative that got pushed was more along the lines of the positive story of the king and how he helped the Allies. So in conclusion, the application of the term “Axis power” is generally just left to that simple reasoning of the initial signers of the Tripartite Agreement. Whatever the military size and role that a country had, Germany, Italy, and Japan were the three countries that were really exerting their own power and ideas on the world, and other countries aligned with them, like Romania, have more complicated or insularly self-serving roles in WWII. And the 75 years that have passed since the war ended were largely filled with further divisions that politicized the very teaching of these countries’ roles in WWII. Today, the roles those countries played may not be widely suppressed or hidden, though I’m sure you can find plenty of debate and politicized history if you dig for it especially within those countries. But for the purposes of general education of WWII outside of those countries, especially in grade school or secondary school, teaching the Axis as the Big Three is often enough.',\n",
       " 'I wrote an earlier answer here focusing on the relationship of the Shāhnāmeh to pre-Sasanian history, which may be of interest. As that answer indicates, there is some content in the Shāhnāmeh (and in other medieval histories of pre-Islamic Iran) about the Achaemenids and Parthians--though, as you point out, not under those names. The New Persian form of “Achaemenid,” Hakhāmaneshi, is, I believe, unattested in premodern texts. “Parthian,” pahlavi, wasn’t associated with a particular dynasty until the 20th century. Rather, it referred to an archaic form of the Persian language, and/or a generalized heroic past; pahlavān came to mean a hero or champion, of any era. Classical Greek historians claimed that a figure called Hystaspes was connected with the origins of the Achaemenid dynasty. Called Vishtāspa in Old Persian and Goshtāsp in New Persian, he’s a central character for a significant portion of Ferdowsi’s epic, particularly since he was linked with the advent of Zoroastrianism. The character of Dārā corresponds to Darius III (Dārayavaush), though the name seems to be borrowed from non-Persian sources (probably “Alexander Romance” material; again, my linked answer goes into more detail on this). And while Ferdowsi offers very little on the Parthians/Arsacids, his contemporaries could muster a little more information. The Ghurar Akhbar Mulūk al-Fars wa-siyaruhum (“Highlights of Information about the Kings of Persia, and their Biographies”), which may or may not be by a scholar named al-Tha’ālabī, was written around the same time as the Shāhnāmeh. It provides information on a number of Ashkanian kings. Even if these cannot clearly be correlated with historical Parthian kings, (except the last one, Ardavan, who also figures prominently in the Shāhnāmeh), pseudo-al-Tha’ālabī still attests to some degree of interest in, and material connected to, this period. You ask specifically about Cyrus, and are right to suspect that his involvement with the Israelites granted him a place in later historiography. The great historian Al-Ṭabarī, writing in Arabic about a hundred years before Ferdowsi, was well aware of this figure, whom he calls Kīrash son of Akhshūyarash (corresponding to Hebrew Ăḥašwêrôš and Latinized Ahasuerus). He admits that there is dispute over this character’s correspondence to the ancient Iranian king lists, and suggests a few possibilities: Kīrash may be identified with Bishtāsp (the Goshtāsp referred to above), or with Kay Arash (a figure with a number of possible genealogies, who appears very briefly in the Shāhnāmeh and other texts). Al-Ṭabarī seems to prefer the latter identification, explaining that Kay Arash was appointed sub-ruler over Babylon; while never King of Kings, he was a person “of great importance” ‘aẓīm ash-sha’n. Needless to say, modern etymology does not suggest a real connection between Cyrus/Kurosh and Kay Arash. The later idea that Cyrus is represented by the Shāhnāmeh’s Kay Khosrow is, as far as I can tell, a European notion from the late 18th century. But this methodology of identifying names from one tradition with better-known figures from another meant that premodern Iranian historians didn’t perceive any significant gaps in their historical record. So we’re not dealing with a complete lacuna. But you’ll also note that I’ve focused here on Islamicate, rather than Sāsānian sources. This is because very little historical writing survives that is unambiguously Sāsānian. With the exception of a few inscriptions, and the fascinating but qualitatively different evidence of coins, seals, and similar finds, we are almost entirely reliant on the empire’s non-Persian contemporaries and on significantly later records in Middle Persian, Arabic, and New Persian to get any sense of the history of the Sāsānians themselves, let alone how they perceived earlier historical periods. It seems likely that, at least by the late Sāsānian period, there were attempts to create unified historical narratives of the Iranian past; the most famous was referred to as the Xwadāy-nāmag, “The Book of Lords.” But although some translations/versions of this text were almost certainly used by writers including al-Ṭabarī and Ferdowsi, nothing close to a Sāsānian original survives, and we’re left to speculate on what such an account might have looked like. The Middle Persian Kārnāmag-ī Ardaxshīr-ī Pāpagān (“Book of the Deeds of Ardashir of the Pāpagān”), a heavily romanticized biography about the founder of the Sāsānian dynasty, may not be vastly different from its pre-Islamic original, though the surviving manuscripts are much later. And the Kārnāmag itself tells virtually the same story of Arsacid irrelevance as the Shāhnāmeh does. Keep in mind that we’re dealing with huge swathes of time--over five centuries between the death of Darius III and the rise of Ardashir, a period so long that medieval Islamicate sources routinely cut it in half. In those centuries, huge linguistic and cultural shifts occurred throughout the Persianate world. Knowledge of the cuneiform Old Persian script was lost with the Achaemenids; Greek texts like Herodotus or Xenophon, which might have provided more information, do not seem to have been known or read in Iran until modern times. If the Parthians recorded their history in writing, we have no evidence of it. Sāsānian royal propaganda explicitly made their dynasty the heirs of the sacred Avestan Kayanians; the intervening period was portrayed as a dark age, a nadir of Iranian power. The ubiquity of the Alexander legend meant that this figure, and a few notable Persians whom he interacted with (such as Darius and Roxana), had to be accounted for. But once these were grafted onto the end of the legendary Kayanian dynasty, the result was a comprehensive narrative that endured essentially until the 19th century, when Iranians began confronting the gap between their sources and those that Europeans possessed. I don’t know much about this later phenomenon (though I’d like to; future research perhaps?), so I’ll break off here. Some sources are linked at the bottom of my earlier answer; please let me know if I can clarify or follow up on any of this!',\n",
       " \"I loved Jo Jo Rabbit, but it should be appreciated as a caricature of life under Nazi rule, as well as the demise of the Third Reich, rather than a serious attempt to describe those events. Hitler committed suicide on April 30th, 1945. It took about two weeks for German forces across the European theater to surrender. At the time of his death there were German forces fighting throughout Germany, but also hundreds of thousands of men still active in Austria, Italy, Denmark and parts of Central Europe. Why did they fight even after Hitler died? I'm not trying to be flip when I say that it takes time for something as big as a world war to wind down. You're talking about something that has literally millions of participants locked in life or death struggle that had been going on for almost six years. Many likely didn't know about Hitler's death until a few days after it happened. Others were of course following orders from their own superiors, as for a few days at least it may not have been a foregone conclusion that Hitler's death automatically meant the war was over (although of course by then the result of the war was hardly in doubt and some individual commanders had entered into surrender negotiations even before Hitler's suicide). There was actually a succession after Hitler's death, as Goebbels and Admiral Donitz became the new leaders of Nazi Germany for just a couple weeks (with Goebbels of course committing suicide just days after his appointment). Some of the will to fight on also undoubtedly was out of fear of what would happen to Germans if they surrendered. In the East in particular, the Soviet reprisals against the German civilian population were brutal and well known (as had been the German treatment of so many Soviet civilians), the Germans in those areas knew what awaited them which undoubtedly motivated some continued resistance, either out of fear or the hope that resistance in the East would mean more Germans could surrender to the Western Allies. Related to this is that, among senior Reich officials in particular, the German actions of the last 6 years had practically created a death cult. By which I mean that the Nazis throughout WW II had crossed so many Rubicons that many who were involved knew that even if they survived the war, they may not survive the peace. The collapse of the Third Reich created a wave of mass suicides among Germans. As for your side question, again, that scene in the movie is a caricature. That being said, things became very desperate towards the end of WW II, with relatively young children and old men conscripted into the ranks and sent to fight with very little training, sometimes issued with just a Panzerfaust in the hopes they could knock out an enemy armored vehicle. There are a ton of books about the fall of the Third Reich. The Third Reich at War by Evans is a good one. The End and Hitler: A Biography, by Kershaw, are two other good sources.\",\n",
       " \"The reasons that drove some men to piracy to begin with didn't die with their pardons. Reasons such as lack of prospects on land, hope to make a good fortune and, or to provide for their family. Good former pirates didn't necessarily make for desirable candidates for prime jobs outside of the sea. Some men hoped to switch to privateering and either managed, had a bad go of it, or just decided pirating was preferable. Some men had been pirates so long, or at least sailors of a kind, that it was the life and job they best knew. That kind of acclimation could apply to men who had been reluctant pirates initially. The pardon was hard to turn down but that didn't mean it was easy for the men to stick to once they had it. Stede Bonnet's motivations get tossed about in history. He wasn't always a pirate when he 'was a pirate', he spent awhile as a guest on his own ship after promoting Blackbeard to his captaincy. By the time the pardons came Stede seemed ready to leave the pirate life behind. Blackbeard didn't trust Eden enough to go without a test dummy and sent Stede ahead to test out the business of getting a pardon. Meanwhile he also marooned a portion of crew, damaged ships, and fled with a treasure that wasn't all his. Blackbeard got wind of Stede's granted pardon, got his own, got Governer Eden to grant him a privateering comission, and proceeded to be a pirate while Eden looked the other way. Stede rescued the marooned men and either wanted to or was forced to seek revenge against Blackbeard. Which led to him either wanting to or having to return to piracy. Rackham is a pirate who might have actually held to his pardon. But then he went and met Anne Bonny. She was already married to a man who worked as a pirate informant for Governer Eden. Neither pleading nor bribery would get Anne's husband to agree to a divorce, so Rackham and Anne fled to the sea in a stolen ship which voided his pardon. Piracy was the natural choice at that moment, and they didn't live long after. Rackham, and probably Stede, didn't go back to piracy as a first choice. Whether Blackbeard ever actually intended to follow his pardon, he quickly lost interest, or it was a show and a way to get in Eden's pocket, we'll likely never know. I don't know the statistics for other men returning to piracy after accepting pardons, and how quickly they did so. Whether it was many or few, the men flipping on their pardons were presumably not ones who'd had great success after returning to land or 'privateering'. Piracy was a dangerous business but ultimately it could seem the most profitable, reliable, and familiar enterprise for men accustomed to it and lacking better prospects.\",\n",
       " 'So my question is this, how did Nazi Germany create so many skilled scientists? They didn\\'t. Nazi Germany inherited a declining scientific establishment, which still had and still trained good scientists and engineers. Prussia had introduced the modern research university, and German research soared. Germany also had a modern and strong industrial base. In the late 19th century, Germany was a world-leader in many fields of science and technology. However, the economic trauma of WWI, and the Great Depression, were serious blows to German science. The Nazi takeover of Germany was another serious blow, as the Nazi attack on Jewish scientists removed many skilled scientists and engineers (consider that Fritz Haber, who made perhaps the most militarily important scientific contributions for Germany for WWI (the Haber-Bosch process for ammonia production, essential to keep German explosive manufacture going after imports of nitrates were cut by the Allied blockade, and also much work on chemical weapons) was Jewish). The main field in which Germany was ahead was rocketry, and they also had innovative aeronautical engineers and scientists. Some of the prominent ones who were recruited for work in the USA through Operation Paperclip were: Wernher von Braun, trained mostly pre-Nazi (and partly in Switzerland), awarded his doctorate in 1934. Hermann Oberth, rocketry pioneer, trained in the 1910s and 1920s. Pre-Nazi. Hans Amtmann, aircraft designer. Pre-Nazi, worked on the design of the Junkers Ju 52 in 1930. Anton Flettner, aircraft engineer. Pre-Nazi, was working in the field in WWI. Adolf Busemann, developer of the swept-wing. Pre-Nazi, with doctorate in 1924. Werner Dahm, who became the Marshall Space Flight Center Chief Aerodynamicist. Trained under the Nazis. The Nazi regime hampered his education, by denying him enrolment in some aircraft-related courses because he didn\\'t join the Nazi student club. Konrad Dannenberg, a key engineer on the Saturn V. Most of his education was pre-Nazi; he was 21 when the Nazis came to power (and had joined the Nazi Party in 1932). Kurt H. Debus, also a key engineer on the Saturn V. Most of his education was pre-Nazi; his doctorate was under the Nazis. A Nazi himself, joining the SA in 1933, and later the SS. Walter Dornberger. Pre-Nazi, was working with the Reichswehr on rocketry. Krafft Arnold Ehricke. A young amateur rocketeer in the 1920s, trained in aeronautics under the Nazis. Sighard F. Hoerner, aerodynamicist. Much of his training (and possibly all) was pre-Nazi. Alexander Lippisch, pioneering aircraft designer, worked on delta wings and supersonic designs. Trained pre-Nazi (he was already working in the 1920s). Robert Lusser, aircraft designer. Trained pre-Nazi. Hans Multhopp, aircraft engineer, entered university in 1934 so trained under the Nazis. Hans von Ohain, jet engine pioneer. Trained mostly pre-Nazi, obtaining his PhD in 1935. Started jet engine work in 1933. Arthur Rudolph, rocker engineer, worked on the V-2. Trained pre-Nazi. Kurt Tank, aircraft designer. Trained pre-Nazi. Richard Vogt, aircraft designer, Trained pre-Nazi. Herbert A. Wagner, worked on the Henschel Hs 293 glide bomb. Trained pre-Nazi. Walter Haeussermann, rocket engineer. Finished his training under the Nazis. Helmut Hölzer, worked on radio guidance and analog computers. Mostly studied pre-Nazi, and had to quit his studies when his scholarship was \"coincidentally\" cut by the Nazis when he didn\\'t join the Nazi student club. For an interview with him, see https://www.si.edu/media/NASM/NASM-NASM_AudioIt-000003012DOCS-000001.pdf Johannes Plendl, worked on radio navigation. Trained pre-Nazi. Fritz Karl Preikschat, radar scientist. Trained mostly pre-Nazi (graduated in 1934). Eberhard Rees, rocket pioneer and later director of NASA\\'s Marshall Space Flight Center. Trained mostly pre-Nazi (graduated in 1934). In summary, the Nazis mostly inherited their scientific talent, rather than creating it. They drove away significant scientific talent, and did more harm to German science than benefit.

       " \"While more can definitely be said by someone with more knowledge on the settlement, and the Russian colonization of North America as a whole, Russian exploration of the California region started in 1803 as a fur-trading mission for the Russian-American Company. The Russians eventually established Fort Ross, in modern day Sonoma County (northern area of the San Francisco Bay Area), California, in 1812. Although it's the only Russian colony south of Alaska and the primary focus was fur-trading. By 1824 however, the Russian-American Company was looking into the viability of establishing a colony from modern day Oregon down to the SF Bay Area and east to around modern day Sacramento, in addition to establishing a permanent naval base for the Russian Navy. However, this was never fully realized due to the rapid expansion of the newly form United States of America, and the likely inevitability of their desires to expand all the way to the Pacific. By 1841 however, Fort Ross' was too costly for the RAC to maintain, along with the reduced supply of fur due to the over hunting of fur mammals, and was sold to a Swiss immigrant named John Sutter (who would also later establish Sutter's Fort, which became the future state capital, modern day Sacramento).\",\n",

       " 'If you\\'re specifically curious about Solzhenitsyn\\'s figure, you might want to check out this answer I wrote about where he got them. A brief summary from that answer - Solzhenitsyn cites extremely high numbers of \"victims of communism\" (so not exactly the same as gulag deaths) based off of information from the statistician Ivan Kurganov. Kurganov had quite the wild history: he fought for the Whites in the Russian Civil War, became a statistician for the Soviets in 1920s, then collaborated with the Germans in World War II and relocated to Berlin, then emigrated to New York after the war. His figures are and were even at the time considered extremely dubious (other Soviet emigres requested that Solzhenitsyn stop citing Kurganov), and are based off of population projections rather than documentation of deaths (so basically Kurganov was arguing that the Soviet population should have been 66 million/110 million higher without Soviet rule). The most charitable interpretation of Solzhenitsyn making these claims is that he was trying to force the Soviet government to release its records to disprove his claims. The less charitable interpretation is that he gave a platform and wide currency for a bunk statistic created by a Nazi collaborator. With that said - the Gulag records are considered to underreport camp-related deaths. Part of this was padding figures by releasing terminally sick prisoners before they died. There is some debate as to what the true figure should be - one academic historian, Golfo Alexopoulos, claims about 6 million related deaths, but most historians put the total death range around 1.5-1.7 million. Historian Timothy Snyder gives a total Soviet death count under Stalin (including famine victims) up to 9 million, but other historic estimates that have made since about 1990 for total deaths under Stalin can go up to 20 million.',\n",
       " 'Your question contains a fundamental problem with a lot to unpack: it attempts to place some sort of objective measurement of what is undeniably subjective. If “Soviet era vehicles seem misshapen” to you, then they simply do, then there’s nothing more to be said about it. And that’s absolutely fine that you don’t like that aesthetic. And if you like “Western aesthetics” (huge quotes here), that’s fine, too. But then I think you’re digging yourself into a hole as a result of looking at outliers, such as the infamous jet-powered train. Ask yourself: how many jet-powered trains have you seen? What do you consider to be the optimal design of a jet-powered train and how does this specific Soviet jet-powered train deviate from the (functionally and aesthetically) optimal design of a jet-powered train? Design has to follow function. The less it does, the more the function of the machine in question becomes impeded. Consider the A-10 Thunderbolt II with its engines sticking up like Mickey Mouse’s ears, it’s slabby sides and asymmetrical nose. All of this is a result of the intended function. You’re free to call it ugly, but in a weapon, which this plane is, that’s essentially irrelevant. The hole in question becomes even deeper when we consider the origin of some Soviet vehicle designs. I’ll grant you that the famous Zhiguli is a boxy design, but then remember what the Zhiguli actually was: a license-built Italian Fiat 124 Similarly, the ZAZ 965 was modelled after the Fiat 600 And then consider some American cars, like the Zeta Or perhaps this Tatra as an example of a beautiful Eastern bloc car. I hope you see what I’m getting at. Beauty and ugliness are a personal perception and neither is exclusive to any country or region, or geopolitical bloc. Now, I could talk to you all day about planes of the Cold War period (could I ever…), but that is where the difference in aesthetics seems to become even more subjective. When you look at airliners such as the Il-62 or the Tu-124 it becomes difficult to pinpoint any defining trait of these planes as Soviet planes. I mean, I can do it, because I know them, but could a random person on the street just tell you: hey, this plane is Russian and it’s ugly? The differences certainly become more substantial with military aircraft, but would you readily say that the MiG-15 is uglier than the F-86 Or that the Su-27 is uglier than the F-15C In fact, aviation geeks widely consider the Soviet MiG-29 and Su-27 to be among the most beautiful fighter aircraft ever built. Now to be clear, you are absolutely free to think that the F-15C is more aesthetically pleasing than the Su-27UB. But your question was about some overarching design characteristics which would make Soviet vehicles uglier than Western vehicles. And in my opinion, those characteristics don’t exist and never have. All this having been said, I don’t think you’re completely wrong in your assessment. The problem with the Eastern bloc was that there was less commercial need for vehicles such as private cars. The Fiat 126p in Poland or the Trabant in East Germany became ubiquitous as “the cars of the people” and since they were made as cheaply and simply as possible, not much effort went into their aesthetics (though again remember, the Fiat 126p is an Italian car in essence) nor into the manufacturing quality. Thus, their designs imprinted themselves on the overall perception of the automotive industry of the countries in question.',\n",
       " 'To the best of our knowledge, there were no Vikings in Maine at any point. Norumbega is fictional, and the idea that it was secretly a Norse settlement is equally fictional. The one confirmed Norse site in North America is L\\'anse Aux Meadows, on the north coast of Newfoundland. Other sites in Newfoundland are likely and there are several ongoing projects to identify more along the west coast of the island, but it is difficult. L\\'anse Aux Meadows appears to have only been inhabited for a few years, before being peacefully abandoned - there may have been sporadic visitors to the site later, to be fair - Icelandic annals say that Bishop Eiríkr of Greenland traveled to Vinland in 1121 - while his motivations are unknown, my personal guess is that he heard the oral traditions about the Skrælingjar that would become the two Vínland sagas and tried to resurrect the settlements. He died on the way and a new bishop arrived in Greenland 4 years later. While people have, since the late 1700s, tried to use the two 13th century sagas as a map of sorts to identify Norse sites in the modern US. Even relatively recent editions of _Grænlendinga saga_ do this, such as the Penguin Sagas of Icelanders collection, which claims that the settlement of Nýhöfn is at Long Island. This idea assumes reliability where there is none, and has to reconcile contradictory information between Eiríks saga rauða and Grænlendinga saga. It also is heavily ideological - America, then, would be \"properly\" Scandinavian, Protestant (despite the Vikings living centuries before Protestantism existed), and White. There has never, ever been a genuine medieval Norse find in the modern US. While I suppose it\\'s possible that Þorfinnr karlsefni, the main settler, happened to stop on the coast once, there was no permanent settlement, there was no integration, and they left no evidence of their arrival or departure, so as far as we can reliably say as historians without time machines, it is unlikely that there were ever Vikings in Maine.',\n",
       " 'So I believe the trial of Anne Hutchinson is a good place to start. This trial predates the witchcraft trials, and Hutchinson is not specifically accused of witchcraft. She is accused of heresy for acting as a kind of reverend for women. Positions like the priesthood were exclusively male at the time. This trial demonstrates the ways in which religion is used in puritan society to effectively maintain control over the society, but especially over women. After this trial many of the events that lead up to the Salem trials take place. It is difficult to determine if women, following Hutchinson, became slightly more rebellious during this period, or if the male clergy and magistrates became more paranoid of women subverting their control. In either case, after the trial of Anne Hutchinson many more trials for heresy and eventually witchcraft as well were initiated. Another element of the paranoia that seems to have infected puritan society at the time may have been caused by increasing native resistance to the encroachments of the settlers. This led to many puritan refugees after whole villages on the frontier were attacked. This in turn produced suspicions that refugees were in league with the antichristian forces (native americans), and had perhaps aided in the downfall of their previous villages. Another way the oppression of women might have come into play once the allegations of witchcraft were thrown around was this: many women of lower status saw how quickly they could have temporary power over the whole community just by making these allegations. So while witchcraft was a charge often used against poor or lower status women and some men (usually through association with accused women), the other women who threw around these accusations could actually wield incredible power until a case was resolved. At least this is my understanding of the events, I hope it was helpful.',\n",

In order to escape a severely damaged plane, you would have to open the canopy and bail (jump) out. This was only done when the plane was severely damaged to the point that it was unflyable or on fire. Many pilots decided instead to ditch their planes. Ditching is attempting to crash land on top of water and hopefully scramble out of the plane before it sunk. This was actually safer than bailing out. I’m not sure you’re going to find an exact percentage, but from certain information you can infer that survival was unlikely. In 1940 the RAF did not have a dedicated Search and rescue service. It wouldn’t be until 1941 that the British established a dedicated rescue service under coastal command. Due largely to the losses incurred during the Battle of Britain. Instead because of the high traffic in the channel they mostly depended on a ship or boat to spot the down airman and rescue them. The temperature of the channel meant that a pilot in the warmest time of year would have an expected survival rate of 40 hours. The average temp of the channel is in the low 50-degree range. The RAF lost 540 airmen during the Battle of Britain. It’s estimated that more than 200 died while waiting to be rescued after successfully bailing out or ditching their plane in the channel.',\n",

       " \"Firstly, to provide some context (taken from a previous answer of mine we need to talk about the Great Australian Silence. The term 'The Great Australian Silence' was originally the title of one of the anthropologist W. E. H. Stanner's 1968 Boyer Lectures. The Boyer Lectures was broadcast on the national broadcaster ABC radio at the time, and Stanner's series of Lectures were soon published in text form (and later in a collected series of essays, which I have, and which the quotes below come from). Stanner's lectures were about Aboriginal people, and in the lecture 'The Great Australian Silence', Stanner turned his eye to the way that Australian histories portrayed Aboriginal people...or didn't. By 'The Great Australian Silence' Stanner means the systematic (and very convenient) removal of Aboriginal people from the grand narrative of Australian history typically discussed in history books. That is, Australian history talks about European colonists seeking to ...colonise, to settle on a particular piece of land and use it for their own purposes, without talking about the process by which that settlement must have happened (i.e., the removal of the people who had previously been the traditional owners of the lands). And especially without talking about the indigenous peoples whose lives continued after they were dispossessed of their lands. To quote Stanner, as he surveys some mid-20th century histories of Australia: The next was George Caiger’s The Australian Way of Life , in which the word ‘aboriginal’ is not to be found; no, I am wrong; it does occur— once, in a caption under a photograph which displays two of Australia’s scenic attractions, the Aborigines and Coogee Beach. To the next book, W.V. Aughterson’s Taking Stock: Aspects of Mid-Century Life in Australia , there were ten contributors. Only one of them, Alan McCulloch, the art critic, has anything to say about the Aborigines, some passing but perceptive observations on their art. Incidentally, the book opens with a chapter entitled 'The Australian Way of Life’, written by W. E. H. Stanner, who can safely be presumed never to have heard of the Aborigines, because he does not refer to them and even maintains that Australia has ‘no racial divisions like America’. Take that, W. E. H. Stanner! I wonder if they're related? Anyway, W. E. H. Stanner's conclusion about why this is, is that: A partial survey is enough to let me make the point that inattention on such a scale cannot possibly be explained by absent-mindedness. It is a structural matter, a view from a window which has been carefully placed to exclude a whole quadrant of the landscape. What may well have begun as a simple forgetting of other possible views turned under habit and over time into something like a cult of forgetfulness practised on a national scale. We have been able for so long to disremember the Aborigines that we are now hard put to keep them in mind even when we most want to do so. And part of the reason for this Great Australian Silence according to Stanner, is that it asks some very awkward questions of people of European heritage, that they do not want to think about: All land in Australia is held in consequence of an assumption so large, grand and remote from actuality that it had best be called royal, which is exactly what it was. The continent at occupation was held to be disposable because it was assumed to be ‘waste and desert’. The truth was that identifiable Aboriginal groups held identifiable parcels of land by unbroken occupancy from a time beyond which, quite literally, ‘the memory of man runneth not to the contrary’. The titles which they claimed were conceded by all their fellows. There are still some parts of Australia, including some of the regions within which development is planned or actually taking place, in which living Aborigines occupy and use lands that have never been ‘waste and desert’ and to which their titles could be demonstrated, in my opinion beyond cavil, to a court of fact if there were such a court. In such areas if the Crown title were paraded by, and if the Aborigines understood what was happening, every child would say, like the child in the fairy-tale, ‘but the Emperor is naked’. Since Stanner's lecture about the Great Australian Silence, there has been a noticeable move to include Aboriginal people in histories of Australia, with Henry Reynolds in particular being someone who was inspired by Stanner's lecture to put Aboriginal people closer to the central narrative of Australian history. Mdern history textbooks of Australia such as that by Peel & Twomey show the benefit of that, with the perspectives of indigenous people regularly included. Anyway, getting to Hancock's book Australia, the copy in my university's library is currently on hold, and I can't find a copy online to verify this, but a couple of different articles or books about Hancock comment on the chapter title 'The Invasion Of Australia' and make it clear that the invasion that Hancock is referring to isn't a military invasion complete with frontier wars, but instead an ecological invasion, figuring out how to harness the environment towards the goal of Western-style agriculture. In the 1998 Hancock Lecture (an annual lecture delivered in tribute to Hancock, who despite his faults was important in the development of Australian academic history), Ian McLean argued that: ...one of Hancock's major tropes of empire was the capture and occupation of the land. His first chapter, 'The Invasion of Australia', did not, as the title might suggest, chronicle the clash of armies, but a battle with the land. The taming of nature by pastoralists became the means of forgetting the history of Aboriginal contact. Here the land was not a resource, but an enemy to be defeated as in any other invasion. Thus, he writes: The explorers were scouts thrown out by the advancing army of pastoralists . . . Far away on the fringes . . . adventurous pastoralists skirmished with drought and raided the desert . . . The story of these brave assaults upon the interior of Australia . . . that adventurous race of men who first dared, with their flocks and herds, to invade the unknown interior of the continent. The land and not the Aborigines were invaded and defeated. The Aborigines were not conquered because they had never conquered the land. The Aborigines were not defeated but dispossessed - which is why his opening sentence, 'the British peoples have alone possessed her', immediately writes Aboriginal texts out of the picture without even needing to account for or name them. The Aborigines have no role in the making of Hancock's Australia- that is, they have the role of oblivion. Elsewhere, in a 2010 biography of Hancock, A Three Cornered Life: The Historian W. K. Hancock by Jim Davidson, Davidson ultimately agrees with McLean: ...after spectacularly entitling the opening chapter of the book 'The Invasion of Australia', it soon becomes plain that hie is tracing the impact of the British on a new environment, which they transform utterly. Although aware of the brutal effect on the Aborigines, Hancock's own attitude seems to merge with that of the average white Australia, who 'sheds over their predestined passing an economical tear'. So, basically, despite the provocative chapter title, Hancock's Australia indeed fits fairly and squarely within the Great Australian Silence framework described by Stanner - he's talking about ecological invasion. In Hancock's day, it was a common expression that Australia's economy was 'riding on the sheep's back', and Hancock was concerned with showing how the Australian economy was transformed by transforming Australia's ecology into something suitable for merino sheep. So yes, there was no controversy and backlash at the time, because Hancock is not talking about, you know, the topic matter of John Connor's 2002 book The Australian Frontier Wars 1788-1838.\",\n",
       " 'I can’t speak to the question about the book itself and if it generated controversy, I suspect it may have but only slightly as a contribution to what was at the time a non-existent field to academia essentially (that being post-colonial social history). Counter-intuitively however the reason that the question of invasion is contentious now when it was not before is precisely because of the post-colonial social history that has been done in the decades since. During the period of colonial expansion and in its immediate aftermath the archives are full of references and lamentations of the “invasion of Australia”. Multiple conflicts with Aboriginal people are referred to as “wars”, there was substantial humanitarian efforts, particularly in the colony of Victoria to try and stem the tide of destruction that was apparent both to settler governments and peoples but to people in England and around the world. Then, after federation occurred in 1901 this essentially stops. At the time and throughout the first half of the 20th century, Australia had in place a policy of segregation, control and “breeding out” of Aboriginal people, who were denied citizenship and voting rights and who were controlled by state protectorate boards in every aspect of their lives. In this framework, “Terra Nullius” as a legal fiction becomes law of the land. Officially, on the Federal level and according to most academics at the time, there was no one there before 1788. In the 1960’s an Anthropologist named Bill Stanner who was doing research on Indigenous peoples noted this conspicuous absence in the historical record and in academic fields, calling it “the great Australian silence”. In the 1970’s and 80’s historians like Henry Reynolds (the other side of the frontier) and Richard Broome (Aboriginal Australians) began writing histories of Aboriginal experiences of colonisation, and this field has expanded greatly over the years. However there was backlash, conservative historians disagreed with the attempts to mar the history of the country with what they felt was an exaggeration of negative events, and the derisive label of “black armband historians” was then picked up and used by John Howard both before and after he was elected Prime Minister. Australia is essentially still undergoing that culture war, and saying that the country was “invaded” signals which side of the war you are on, which when Hancock wrote the book, was not really the case. Essentially this book came out at a time when Aboriginal history was completely overlooked and ignored, and I suspect the book itself may have been as well (I never came across it while doing my degree in Aboriginal history). But in the time since it was written the aboriginal history of the country has become a larger and larger focus of academic study and cultural discussion, and as such has been swept into the culture war, making it contentious. Hope this is at least useful even if doesn’t answer your question directly.',\n",
       " \"The discussion of Australian historiography was first really started by Bill Stanner in the 1960s. Stanner challenged the narrative of an Australia settled by the British peacefully, addressing what he called the Great Australian Silence. This focus on the negative impacts of colonisation, especially for indigenous Australians, was thread that carried through the works of his contemporaries such as Manning Clark and Henry Reynolds. Clark’s six volume history of Australia, for example, was controversial in its attack on the old colonial values of early Australia and the particular historical narrative it created (I should note that Clark’s views on indigenous Australians were criticised, and he only edited his Histories to include acknowledgements of aboriginal lives quite late in his life). Australian history was increasingly politicised in the late 80s and early 90s in Australia. While Clark was a huge supporter of Whitlam and virulently anti-Menzies (which is influential in volumes 4 of the Histories). A large part of this was the eminence of Australian historian Geoffrey Blainey, who lectured at the University of Melbourne after Clark. In a 1988 article, Blainey described the current trends in Australian history as negative towards the British, focusing on violence, exploitation, repression, racism, sexism, capitalism, colonialism, and a few other 'isms'.’(Blainey, Eye on Australia: Speeches and Essays of Geoffrey Blainey, 1991). Blainey later fleshed out his views in the 1993 John Latham lecture, coining the phrase ‘black armband history’ for this particular focus (Clark was one of the historians named). The Howard government of 1996-2007 adopted Blainey’s term and weaponised it against critics of the Howard government’s indigenous policy. This included the 1997 Bringing them Home report on the Stolen Generation and a government review of the National Museum of Australia, to name a few issues.The ‘history wars’ as they’ve come to be known, saw an outpouring of historical debate on either side of the political spectrum. I’d argue that discussions of the invasion of Australia aren’t so much taboo as they are tied to political and social values. Debates around invasion and violence are tied up with ideas of nationalism and patriotism, and ultimately a sense of self. Writing the history of Australia becomes increasingly complex when the very narrative has been tied to a sense of national pride (or a lack thereof). Sources (some info missing, sorry!)

       " \"There is a standardised way to cite ancient authors in academic works based on how the work is divided. This is because every well known ancient work is divided into the same way, at least if you're using a proper version made for academics, and not just for popular audiences. If you don't have a version like that, I recommend Perseus Tufts online. This is so that no matter what version or translation you have, you can still easily look up the same section when you come across the citation. You never write pages if you can avoid it for ancient books. In the citation, no matter what style you're using, you write a shortened version of the author, the shortened version of the name of the book and then the citation that the book uses. For example, The Republic by Plato is divided into books and sections. So the very first part of the book would be cited something like this: ^Plat. Rep. 1.327a So, you're almost correct in the way The Gallic Wars is cited. It divided into books and chapters. However, you need to put a short form of the work in question, even though it's probably clear in the context you're using it in your video. Caesar didn't just write that, and there were multiple authors called that, so I would write: ^Caes. Gal. 4.15 In the bibliography (if you have that), you write the full information in the way your citation style dictates. Remember to include the year and translator/editor.\",\n",
       " \"This was a fun question. First, a bit of background: Aztec food largely came from two sources. The first of these was the tribute system, which we know of largely from the Codex Mendoza. I won't discuss it here, as it represents a rather diverse set of agricultural methods specific to each town and the crops they produced for tribute. The second major source for the Aztecs was the Chinampas system, which was a system of raised beds separated by shallow canals in the lakes of the Valley of Mexico. These beds were made of the shoveled mud from the decomposed organic matter at the bottom of the lake and were possibly the most productive agricultural system in the world at the time. This system still exists today, which means we have somewhat modern data for it. Taking numbers from Martínez Ruiz 1 citing an older paper from the '50s, yield at the time was an astonishing 3,000-4,000 kg/ha, translating to 44-60 bu/acre. This is comparable to yields in the US until the 1960s 2. But wait, there's more. This is yield from the 50s, maybe they were using modern fertilizers and modern variants (despite what the paper says about traditional methods). I dug up a rather infamous paper from De Montellano 3 about Aztec Cannibalism that provides some helpful numbers about precolumbian yield. Because this paper is focused on nutritional yield, it breaks things down into dietary components. Luckily, they've calculated two sample diets for us, one consisting of 400g of daily corn and the other with 300g. These numbers are reasonably in-line with what I'd expect from my own area. Since they give the chinampas area (9000 hectares) and the number of people they support (180k), we just have to pull the math through: ((population daily_intake 365) / area) ~= 32-45 bu/acre Keep in mind that this isn't even the full productivity of the chinampas system, as only 2 of the 7 annual harvests were corn. That's a simply astonishing level of agricultural productivity and highlights how Tenochtitlan became one of the largest cities of the medieval world. 1 Martínez Ruiz, J. L. .

       " 'The first thing to say is that multiple terminologies for the same historical event can exist parallel to each other without conflict. People with distinct cultures, experiences and preferences can and do recognise events through different terminology. There is often no “appropriate” or universally recognised term for certain events that all historians agree upon. For example, the Second Sino-Japanese War is commonly used in western academic circles to describe the conflict between China and Japan in 1937-1945. In China, the Anti-Japanese War of Resistance (抗日戰爭) is widely used to describe the same conflict, while in Japan, the Japanese-Chinese War (日中戦争) is perhaps the most prominent out of a myriad of terms. However, there are specific terms that historians identify as deliberate attempts to downplay the severity of certain events. In the case of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the term “the China Incident” is used by Japanese nationalists to downplay the significance of the conflict and has been rejected by the majority of Japanese scholars, which I have discussed here In the case of the war crimes committed in and around the city of Nanjing in 1937-1938, I personally don’t find much of a difference between the terms “the Nanjing Massacre” and “the Rape of Nanjing”. Both terms are evocative and hard to define - to be pedantic, neither fully encompasses the scale, severity and degree of the atrocities which occurred in the region. But I think we can identify several reasons as to the more contemporary academic shift away from the term “the Rape of Nanjing”. To be clear, this shift is very contemporary. The respected Chinese historian Timothy Brook’s source collection Documents on the Rape of Nanking was published in 1999 with little controversy. Controversy is perhaps too strong a word - I doubt any historian would bat an eye or raise a fuss if someone published an academic piece with the term “the Rape of Nanjing” in its title in 2021. The term has simply faded out of use. To better show the usage rate of both terms, I’ve done some internet sleuthing using the Google Books Ngram Viewer, which shows the usage of specific terms in (mostly) English-language academic literature. If we enter the keywords “Nanjing Massacre” and “Rape of Nanjing” into the system, we find “Rape of Nanjing” to be the dominant term from the 1940s to 1980s, increasing parity in the 1980s and 1990s, and finally a sharp decline for “Rape of Nanjing” and a corresponding rise for “Nanjing Massacre” after the 2000s. The results are shown here The prominence of “the Rape of Nanjing” during the 1940s to 1980s can be traced back to the usage of the term in western, not Chinese, conceptions of the atrocities in Nanjing, 1937-1938. As Li Yong-dong argues in their 2016 article “The Nanjing Massacre in Fiction and the Expression of the Idea of the Nation-state,” writers and academics in China tended to stress the masculine nature of blood-letting and the ideology of a national war. Heroic Chinese narratives emphasised that the “Massacre” occurred because of Japanese frustrations over the staunch resistance of Chinese forces in Shanghai. Elements of rape were avoided because the violation of women’s bodies were equated with the violation of China’s national sovereignty. It was for the same reasons that the Guomindang government was initially hesitant to notify the Chinese and western public of Japanese atrocities in Nanjing - their failure to put up meaningful resistance at the nation’s capital was a “humiliation”. The term “rape” had uncomfortable connotations of “powerlessness” and “passiveness” that the Guomindang government and subsequent Chinese academics were keen to avoid in discussing the wider war. To this day, the atrocities in Nanjing are commonly referred to as “the Nanjing Massacre” (南京大屠殺) in both Chinese historiography and popular media. On the other hand, western depictions of the Nanjing atrocities was influenced by initial western accounts, which were mainly penned by missionaries in the Nanjing Safety Zone. Referring to western fiction situated within the context of events in Nanjing, Li Yong-dong notes: They not only took their inspiration and their materials from Westerners’ diaries, but also inherited the cultural viewpoints and religious sentiments of the West, thus copying and magnifying “Western experience.” This means that on many occasions when the Nanjing Massacre is brought into a novel, what it conveys and disseminates is not the value ideals and national spirit of China, but rather images of Christianity, feminism and Western justice, albeit the sufferers in the massacre were Chinese. The diaries and reportage of westerners in Nanjing were personal accounts which viewed the wider war as the background, not the framework, to atrocities in Nanjing. The suffering of the weak - in Nanjing, unprotected women, instead of armed Guomindang soldiers - took precedence in their narratives. Therefore, “the Rape of Nanjing” became the more popular term in use in western media, which in turn influenced western academia. Why, then, did “the Rape of Nanjing” and “the Nanjing Massacre” reach parity in usage during the 1980s and 1990s? I haven’t been able to find academic literature that directly addresses the change in terminology, so to be clear, the following is my own interpretation. In the 1980s and 1990s, China underwent a period of Reform and Opening Up. Restrictions on Chinese academia were relaxed, and for the first time, Chinese and western historians could more or less freely exchange views in writing and conferences. This, I believe, might have led to the rise in use of “the Nanjing Massacre” to better synchronise Chinese and western historiography. While there had been much discussion of the Nanjing atrocities in western academia prior to the 1990s, it was only with the publication of the journalist Iris Chang’s The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II in 1997 that atrocities in 1937-1938 were brought back to western popular discourse. This led to a surge of academic writing with “the Rape of Nanjing” in their titles - besides the aforementioned Brook, Yang Da-qing’s historiographical survey in 1999 was titled “Convergence or divergence? Recent historical writings on the rape of Nanjing.” However, this was short-lived. By the mid-2000s, academics started to put the term within quotations, for example Takashi Yoshida’s The making of the\" Rape of Nanking\": history and memory in Japan, China, and the United States and J.B. Sedgwick’s “Memory on Trial: Constructing and Contesting the \\'Rape of Nanking\\' at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, 1946-1948.” I speculate this change was due to the controversial nature of Iris Chang’s The Rape of Nanking. Mark Eykholt has a balanced discussion of the book in the authoritative The Nanjing Massacre in history and historiography: Even though it offers little new with respect to what is known about the Nanjing Massacre, it does add further eyewitness corroboration of the horrific atrocities committed by invading Japanese troops. In her book, Chang presents some of the documents and stories that inform the emotion-filled Chinese views of the war and Japan, mixing good research and biased speculation to portray an evil and secretive Japan. Written in English, Chang’s work targets an American audience with no personal investment in the Nanjing Massacre and probably little knowledge of it. Hence, she does a service by spreading information about the Nanjing Massacre while unfortunately spreading hearsay as well. Historians were uncomfortable with the combative language of the book, as well as the stereotypical portrayal of Japanese soldiers as bloodthirsty fanatics. The book is further marred by shoddy research in some areas, and is certainly not a serious piece of academic research. I speculate that the controversial nature of The Rape of Nanking has by itself led to heightened sensitivity over academic terminology, and the decline of the term “the Rape of Nanking” in academic usage with the corresponding rise in the usage of “the Nanjing Massacre”.

       " \"What was the Swedish perspective on slavery in colonial times? Very similar to the other European colonizing powers. New Sweden was a success and a failure. They were the only colonists to really maintain a mostly peaceful relation with the local inhabitants and focused largely on trade, which allowed them to stabilize as a colony. A series of conflict with the Dutch in the 1640s and 1650s left the two neighboring colonies fighting for what would become mainly Delaware, with both gaining the upper hand at times. The trade for food with local tribes working large established fields and lack of reinforcements coupled with constant bickering with the Dutch (and for a short time the English) never allowed much in the way of plantations to develop, which was certainly one of their motivators for colonization - they had hoped to break in on the tobacco trade flourishing at that time. In this regard they failed to establish the colony they had intended to form and profit from. The first enslaved man known to be in New Sweden was there from the beginning. Antonius, also known as Black Anthony, came to the colony aboard a Swedish vessel in 1639 (the colony had been formed the year before). Much like the original crew unloaded in Jamestown twenty years earlier, he was able to gain his freedom and even worked for the Governor of the colony, changing his name post freedom to Antoni Swart. This was previous to English law permitting race based slavery even in the colonies (but not by much, and with an arguable exception of Barbados starting in 1636), so it isn't terribly surprising to see the Swedes take the same approach of working for freedom. A much more clear example emerges in 1784 in the wake of the American Revolution. A small French owned Caribbean island, Saint Barthélemy (commonly called St Bart's today), was traded to the Swedes. Since slavery existed in practice on the island, they were faced with the choice of how to proceed. They chose to permit slavery to tend the lucrative plantations already established that they now possesed, and that continued until 1840. So they literally did embrace it just as other nations had, although to a far smaller scale. In addition to this, the Swedes actively participated in the Atlantic Slave Trade. While a very minor player in the overall, some estimates put Swedish vessels as the means of transportation for some 10,000-15,000 enslaved Africans. They certainly had no qualms with it and but for lack of opportunity became a lesser player in the overall. I can't say what could have happened if it all happened differently, but had they established a colony in, say, Carolina in the 1650s, there is no doubt in my mind it would be a different story regarding their level of participation in using forced labor in that timeframe.\",\n",

       " \"There are traditionally two components of narcotics policy: 1)supply control: targeting producers and the supply chain. Production, transportation, and sale of the narcotic 2)demand control: targeting consumers with education, public health campaigns, addiction treatment With regards to illicit narcotics and probationary narcotics policies, evidence indicates that every dollar spent on 'demand control' has the same effect on overall narcotics consumption as ten dollars spent on 'supply control.' In broad strokes, the prohibition of alcohol was almost entirely a campaign of supply control, making the production and transportation of alcohol illegal, but few to no resources were directed towards reducing alcoholism. Despite problem drinkers and alcoholics accounting for the bulk of consumption (roughly 10% of drinkers account for 60% of alcohol consumption, a proportion that holds roughly true for most narcotics). It is helpful to think of prohibition as a battle against a symptom (the alcohol industry) rather than the root cause (addiction and people consuming alcohol). Supply control is also at its core, a fight against the laws of economics. The size of the market’s demand for alcohol, and thus the incentives for bootleggers, are too great for the government to suppress the market through interdiction and policing, like mathematically you can graph interdiction spending against estimated narcotics supply (based on prices) and it is mathematically impossible no matter how high the DEA's budget it. In the modern period demand control also tends to simply drive substitution by consumers. If the government is successful in a given period in reducing the supply of one narcotic, consumers/addicts simply switch their consumption to a different narcotic. In remote or poor communities where the market for narcotics is small enough that 'supply control' can eliminate it, addict consumption merely switches to widely available household products, huffing gasoline, glue, or solvents. So supply control doesn't work, and mathematically cannot work. The 'war on drugs' is a war against the laws of economics. In contrast, the public campaign against tobacco was entirely centered on demand control, affecting consumer behavior through nudge measures such as advertising bans, generic packaging, excise taxes, public education/propaganda, and slowly banning smoking from an increasing number of public spaces. As well as emphasizing treatment of the addiction itself. American per capita cigarette consumption has decreased roughly 75% from its peak, a greater success than has achieved against any illicit narcotic in the US. Another illustrative example is the UK’s experience with alcohol regulation. Alcohol was largely unregulated (with regards to public health) in the US and UK prior to WWI. Wartime rationing caused the introductions of certain regulations, which temperance movements in many countries tried to seize on to institute a complete prohibition of alcohol. The US did end up pursuing prohibition, but the UK nearly the same year instituted a series of aggressive regulations while keeping alcohol legal. Rules about when shops could sell alcohol (not before noon, not after 8pm, not on Sundays, etc), aggressive licensing regimes on pubs (had to serve food, limited number of licenses for an area, could easily lose license for being a source of local trouble), and excise taxes. Prohibition in the united states reduced alcohol consumption by 30-40% for a few years, but consumption had largely recovered after three years. In contrast, regulation in the UK reduced alcohol consumption by 60%, from a higher per-capita level than in the US, and these reductions endured for decades, until many of the regulations were eventually repealed because they are onerous to regular consumers. So to sum up, there are usually two main prongs to narcotics policy, one of the prongs doesn’t work, and the other one does. Prohibition almost exclusively employed the prong that doesn’t work, the campaign against smoking employed the prong which does work.\",\n",

       " \"For Innocent III, the distinction between 'Catholics' and 'Heretics' was so fundamental that he could not conceive of a world without it. Yet to ask how many of these heretics, however designated, there were before the Albigensian Crusade is like asking how many witches there were in Europe on the eve of the great witch craze of the sixteenth and seventeenth century. It assumes the objective, measurable existence of a category that was in the process of being constructed. RI Moore, The War on Heresy , p261 The quote above should give you some idea of where I'm going with this - at least from an Ancient Greek perspective, the whole idea of the question would have made very little sense. Of course, the Greeks understood that different people believed in different gods. Famously, Xenophanes wrote of how every culture believes in gods that look like themselves: Ethiopians say that their gods are snub-nosed and black; Thracians that theirs are are blue-eyed and red-haired. And indeed goes on to say that lions and horses, if they could draw, would probably draw gods that looked like lions and horses - satirically making the point that everyone has a different idea of what the gods look like. On the other hand, while the Greeks are happy to talk about different people's religion, they don't really seem to have thought about the world in terms of religions - that is, systems of belief that were consistent with themselves but meaningfully distinct enough from each other that you could use them to label people. There's an interesting point in the Greek historian and ethnographer Herodotus, writing in the later part of the 5th century BC, where he tries to describe the religion of the Persians: It is not their custom to make and set up statues and temples and altars, but those who make such they deem foolish, as I suppose, because they never believed the gods, as do the Greeks, to be in the likeness of men; but they call the whole circle of heaven Zeus, and to him they offer sacrifice on the highest peaks of the mountains; they sacrifice also to the sun and moon and earth and fire and water and winds. These are the only gods to whom they have ever sacrificed from the beginning; they have learnt later, to sacrifice to Aphrodite Uranaia, from the Assyrians and Arabians. She is called by the Assyrians Mylitta, by the Arabians Alilat, by the Persians Mitra. Herodotus clearly understands that the Persian gods are different, and that their beliefs differ from the Greeks' in massive points of doctrine (most notably, that they do not believe that the gods are anthropomorphic), but he still sees no problem in understanding the Persians' gods as differently-conceived versions of the Greek ones (and to avoid any doubt, the Persians would certain not have done so). Indeed, this is a pretty consistent feature of Greek ethnography - there's no vision of the gods so alien that it can't be fitted into the conventional Greek pantheon. As a concept, 'Zeus', 'Aphrodite' and so on are flexible enough to accommodate just about any interpretation. This is probably because Greek religion was so fragmented and localised that almost no two people had the same ideas about the gods and how to worship them. I'm going to quote a little from an earlier answer I gave on Greek and Roman religion, which was intended to highlight just how diverse 'Greek' religion really was - to the point that even using that phrase can be quite uncomfortable: The 'same' god could look quite different in different contexts. It was normal (particularly in the Greek world) to address a god not only by their name, but also by an 'epithet' - a short descriptor that gave a bit of detail about the god, but also reflected the particular aspect or characteristics of them that you were calling on. Apollo (we'll get to him properly later) is a great example - at Delphi, you would probably address him as Apollo Pythios ('Apollo of the Pythia - his oracular priestess at Delphi) and primarily conceptualise him as a god of prophecy who might advise and help you. On the other hand, if your city was struck by a plague, you might sacrifice to him as Apollo Ekbolos ('Apollo who Strikes from Afar') and conceptualise him as a terrifyingly inscrutable force for vengeance. On one level, they're the same god, but they also feel rather different. You might also have learned in school that the 'big gods' - the Olympians and so on - are only the tip of the religious iceberg: both Greek and Roman religion are full of 'small gods' of rivers and mountains, semi-divine heroes and other extremely local figures that mean that religious observation can change considerably from region to region, or even village to village. Even when talking about the greater gods, different people worship them to different degrees - most obviously, the people of Athens treated Athena as one of the most important of the gods, while she would be a relatively minor religious force in most other Greek cities. This means that the 'international', 'official' Greek pantheon (which was never an idea that anyone in the Greek world, ever, would have accepted) was only ever a kind of lingua franca - people around the Greek world could understand it and use it as a common point of reference, but it didn't really reflect anyone's actual, day-to-day experience of religion. Straight away, we're dealing with a religious landscape that is incredibly fragmented, and where any attempt to generalise about it smooths down the reality. So, to sum up, one way of answering your question would be 'no - because everyone was their own sect!' But that would ignore the second major part of what a 'sect' is - not just a group of people with different beliefs, but a group whose beliefs are labelled deviant and so whom the 'orthodox' practitioners of a religion consider to be outside the 'true' faith. Put another way, calling a certain belief a 'sect' is both a matter of splitting it off from the 'main' religious group (those scare quotes are doing a LOT of work here) and lumping it together as a basically coherent system of belief and identity. It's also something that's, by definition, done from outside - nobody thinks that they're in a sect or a cult. I'll talk a bit more about that in a bit. This isn't to say that Greek religion was all liberal, pluralistic and accepting - people certainly did judge and sometimes kill each other for religious reasons. Most famously, you have the trial and execution of Socrates in 399 BC for, at least in part, 'not believing in the gods of Athens' - while I've written elsewhere on here about how that trial happened in somewhat unusual historical circumstances it's still worth emphasising that 'wrong' belief could, in a certain context, be a literal death sentence. But it's also interesting that no Greek state, as far as we know, tried to do anything like ban the rituals of the Bacchanalia (as the Romans effectively did in 186 BC), even though they were in many ways countercultural and subversive - even perhaps threatening - to the norms and order of the 'civilised' state. The whole idea of marking people as Other on the grounds of their religious expression simply wasn't part of Greek discourse, as far as we can tell. To come back to that point from earlier - that's absolutely what talking about 'sects' is. Nobody ever thinks they're in a cult - think, much later, of Arius in the fourth century AD, who could confidently walk into the Council of Nicaea believing himself to be a Christian, only to walk out condemned as an arch-heretic. Indeed, he might fairly have pointed out that his differences of opinion with any given 'orthodox' bishop were no more significant than the myriad differences of opinion those 'orthodox' bishops had between themselves. But defining 'heresy' and 'sects' is fundamentally an act of defining 'orthodoxy' - the whole reason that the Church was (and arguably is) interested in defining the 'Wrong' things 'They' believe is so as to sort out what the 'Right' things 'We' believe are meant to be. And this is why you see Christian thinkers writing diatribes against Donatists and Manichaeans long after there ever were any Donatists or Manichaeans to argue against - deviant religion is, in many ways, an intellectual construct against which to define orthodoxy. I don't have time or, honestly, the academic background to go into the reasons why this changed so dramatically, but I'll content myself with saying that the Classical Greeks would have admitted neither the need nor the possibility of establishing 'orthodox' belief, and so almost by definition didn't have much use for identifying people as 'sects'.\",\n",
       " 'It\\'s important to note that the two bombs dropped on Japan did not pose an existential risk by themselves. What did? In the minds of many of those who first made the weapons, it was a) the prospect of a secret arms race between the USA and USSR that would lead each side to build up massive arsenals, and b) the prospect of new weapons developments, notably the hydrogen bomb, whose destructive power — and contaminating power — was already understood as orders of magnitude more than the weapons developed during World War II. These possibilities were explored by the members of the Manhattan Project during the war, prior to Hiroshima, especially those scientists who were at the University of Chicago Metallurgical Laboratory, as well as those involved in the higher policy of the Manhattan Project. Chicago was a hot-bed of this kind of discussion because the scientists there finished the bulk of their contribution to the project by 1944 (they were mostly helping design the reactors for the Hanford site), and while some of them moved on to Los Alamos to work on bomb design, many stayed behind and had time on their hands to contemplate what was being built. Among the more tangible outputs of this work was the Franck Report a report of a \"Committee on the Political and Social Problems\" created by atomic energy. It argued in stark terms that a US first-use of the weapon against Japan would likely spur on an arms race, and that this would lead to horrific futures. This was a classified report, and meant to influence policy, but it was not given much official attention, because the wheels were already well in place for the use of the bombs during the war. Even those who wanted to use the bomb on Japan wanted to avoid a postwar arms race. Vannevar Bush and James Conant, two of the top civilian scientist-administrators on the project, authored several reports to the Secretary of War and the President urging the need to adopt some kind of UN controls on the weapon in the immediate postwar. They explicitly feared future weapon developments, notably the \"Super\" or hydrogen bomb, which was already being considered as the \"next step\" prior to Hiroshima. Scientists at Los Alamos had concluded by late 1945 that it would take only a few dozen \"Supers\" at full size (10-100 megatons) to render the Earth too radioactive for long-term human life (as opposed to tens of thousands of Hiroshima-sized bombs) — these calculations, we might note, were overly pessimistic, but it gives you a historical sense of what they feared. Again, these reports were classified. All of this added up to the fact that there were many within the project who believed that if proper national and international action was not taken in the wake of World War II, there would be catastrophe. In various ways they sought to make this message public and try to turn it into policy in the postwar. The \"insiders\" like Bush and Conant tried primarily to influence US national policy, including the adoption of domestic and international controls (they failed at the latter, because the US government could not find enough common ground and shared trust with the Soviets). Those who became \"outsiders,\" like the Chicago scientists in the postwar, tried to speak as openly as they could about this as part of the briefly-influential \"Scientists\\' Movement\" of late 1945 through 1947 or so. The Scientists\\' Movement also lobbied for domestic and international controls (and against secrecy and things that they believed would be counter-productive), but they also took their message to the people, hiring the Ad Council, a lobbying group, to craft campaigns that would make it clear what the stakes were. One of their pithy slogans — \"One World Or None\" — sums up the existential stakes quite simply (the world must either learn to work together, or it will cease to exist). There were limits to what they could say (they could not talk about the Super, which remained a mostly-classified idea until late 1949), but they could try their best. All of which is to say that by the end of 1945 it is fair to imagine that informed citizens of the world who knew anything of the discussions about the atomic bomb would have been aware that the scientists who had built the weapon believed that if their development was unchecked, it would lead to an existentially perilous situation. What exactly the right response to this situation would be, of course, was debatable. One tricky part of your question: what does it mean \"to understand\"? One can say, I have heard this argument and I suppose it is true — is that true understanding, though? Does it penetrate into people\\'s actual minds and actions? It is just worth bringing this up, because in the 1940s, despite a somewhat intellectual understanding of these issues by many people, it is not really clear that the general population actually _really_ took this idea seriously to the degree that they would later. Specifically, by the mid-1950s, one starts to find the \"world-ending apocalyptic bombs\" idea through popular culture in a way that one does not so much in the 1940s. Some of it is the fact that the Soviets did (by 1949) get their own bomb, making the predictions of the scientists about secret arms races seem all the more accurate, but it is also the case that immediately after that event the idea of the Super became part of the public discourse as part of the Hydrogen Bomb Debate (which leaked to the public in November 1949), and made especially evident through the Castle Bravo test of 1954, in which a single large-yield hydrogen bomb contaminated a massive area of ocean and made clear that aside from the metropolis-destroying power of the blast and fire, the fallout contamination posed its own massive threat. What is interesting to me is that all of the ideas that became common in the 1950s were present in discussions from the 1940s, but they don\\'t seem to have become \"salient\" to the broader public to the degree that they did after the H-bomb\\'s debut. Anyway, the above is an overview of a lot of history. The two main books I would recommend on attitudes towards the bomb are Paul Boyer\\'s _By the Bomb\\'s Early Light_ (which looks closely at the 1940s and the USA) and especially Spencer Weart\\'s _Nuclear Fear_ (which looks much more broadly). And if you are interested in the complicated dance between publicity and secrecy, I might recommend my own forthcoming book on the history of nuclear secrecy in the USA which covers this material in the first third or so of the book.',\n",
       " 'Hi, i\\'ll try to give an answer to this. By “formation of the EU in 1993” I would assume you are referring to the 1992 Maastricht Treaty (effective in 1993), which did indeed formally create the European Union (EU), but just as a reform of the existing EC (European Communities). For context, the first step of the EU, The European Steel and Coal Community (ESCS) was created by the 1951 Treaty of Paris. The European Economic Community (EEC) was created by the 1957 Treaty of Rome, and the current regulating treaties are usually called the Lisbon Treaties after the 2007 Treaty of Lisbon that amended both of the EUs foundational treaties. The Treaty of Lisbon also “finished” the modernization that had started slowly with the 1986 Single European Act and/or the 1992 Maastricht treaty. The EU is a very gradual process, and not clearly the response to one problem, issue, ideology or goal. In the answer i will first illustrate some of the general political trajectory from the 1960s to 80s, and then address what the immediate objectives of the Maastricht Treaty were. I\\'ll provide a Tl;dr of the main factors, while illustrating the general trajectory below. Tl;dr The pressures leading to the Maastricht Treaty can, as i will argue below, be generalised into five external pressures and five internal pressures that created a need for both economic and political reform of the EU (then: EC). Main internal factors: 1. A need to increased European competitiveness in the international markets, meant to be realised with a European Single Market and a European Monetary Union. 2. A need for the EU (EC) level to, increasingly, govern some social and regulatory policies in order to combat negative sides of the liberalisation. 3. A need for the EU (EC) to, increasingly, govern border control and crime because the Single Market lessened the competences of the member states to do that. 4. A need to streamline political decision making in order to achieve , and , and to avoid deadlock with a larger amount of member states 5. A need to democratize political decisions because of the EUs (ECs) lack of legitimacy due to a perceived lack of democracy in EU policies. Main external factors: 1. The increasing economic competition from countries like the US and especially Japan (and to a degree other NICs). 2. The collapse of the eastern block put pressure on the EU (EC) to strengthen itself to be able to meet upcoming challenges and take on a larger role. 3. The unification of Germany and the worry of its potential dominance. I.e. states (France) wanted a “European Germany”, rather than a “German Europe”. 4. The break-up of the Soviet Union created uncertainty about the stability of the European continent and further pressure for a strong EU. 5. The end of the cold war and the disappearance of the west/east narrative, making more diplomatic space for a \"Europe\" Background to the 1992 Maastricht Treaty In general, the period from the 1957 Treaty of Rome to the period around the 1986 Single European Act/1992 Maastricht Treaty was one that saw a lot stagnation in European development. The 1960s were dominated by internal conflicts and nationalist sentiment, especially in France under De Gaulle (see: The Empty Chair Crisis) and this seeming halt in integration made some EU analysts have to change their perceptions, often taking more into account the various (conflicting) state interests. The empty chair crisis was solved by The Luxembourg Compromise, which stated that states had an informal veto in anything that affected vital national interests. This crisis is, in general, seen to be a turning point for a 10-20 year period where intergovernmentalism and state interests were more prominent in the EUs (then: ECs) trajectory. There were talks of reform in the late 60s and early 70s, both of an economic and customs union, but they were simply unable to become anything more than ideas with the diverging and strong state interests. But that doesn’t means smaller reforms didn’t happen. With De Gaulle stepping down, the UK (along with Denmark and Ireland†) joined in the 1973 Enlargement. This enlargement is generally seen to have further divided the EU, as the UK and Denmark have consistently been some of the less integrationist members. This sort of leads to the realization that enlargement and integration can contradict each other. Another important context is that the mid 1970s marks an end to a period of impressive EU (then: EC) area growth, where the EU had outgrown non-member states like the UK (the end of the boom was the 1973 oil price recession). Furthermore we had a change in the situation of the dollar as the reserve currency, with the Nixon-administration removing it’s convertibility to gold in 1971, resulting in more fluctuating currencies, along with recurring monetary crises before that. The EU (EC) struggled to respond to any of the external shocks in a collective manner. These combined external and internal pressures created some impetus to make states realise reform was needed, especially strengthening the ability of the EU (then: EC) to make decisions even when members didn’t fully agree. This lead to several gradual and smaller institutional reforms‡, like some reforms to voting, establishing the European Council, establishing direct elections to the European Parliament and expanding the scope of areas the EU (then: EC) was able to deal with. An important step was the EMS (European Monetary System), a sort of fixed-exchange-rate system for European currencies, and a compromise between pure state control and a monetary union, meant to solve some of the issues of currency fluctuations. These were still not major and necessary reforms and the period was marked by quite a lot of “EC pessimism”. The 1980s also saw two enlargements, in 1981 with Greece joining and 1986 with Portugal and Spain joining. Part of the motivation for these enlargements were to ensure that all these countries were stabilised after their transition from authoritarian to liberal-democratic countries. This necessitated some EU policy on regional development, and the large number of states made the existing systems of voting (a lot still requiring unanimity) problematic. Despite reforms, the EU was feeling increasingly uncompetitive on international markets by the 80s, and many blamed it on its fragmented market and regulatory policies, being difficult to navigate and seeing increased protectionist barriers even for intra-European trade. This lead to the EU (EC) growing more slowly than competitors (especially Japan and the US, also the NICs) The This was where the first suggestions of The European Union came, suggested in the European Parliament in 1981 (adopted in 1984). National governments were also suggesting new plans for integration and this point, and industrialists were pushing for the completion of an actual single market. The member states still weren’t willing to transfer substantial political power to the European level, but the 80s saw the emergence of some consensus on the idea that larger reform was needed. Integration would get a kick start with the 1985 Delors-commission, lead by president Jaques Delors. They bundled a lot of the various suggestions into two key reform areas: (i) a project for economic integration and (ii) a project to strengthen the political union. The commission successfully presented these as inherently linked proposals, where the success of one necessitated the other. Following this, studies were conducted and debates were held. But because of the perceived both economic problems (lack of competitiveness) and political problems (lack of efficient governance tools), the support for even quite widespread reform did exist, even if the political reforms were the more controversial ones. Some integration was achieved in the 1986 Single European Act, that increased the use of majoritarian voting in the Council of Ministers in many areas, especially market competences, while significantly increasing the legislative competences of the European Parliament (still, though, being far junior to the Council). It also strengthened the commission and it’s policy-making initiative. Because of the increased importance of the EU in regulating market relations, it was also given increasing competency to combat economic disparities, which had increased since the southern enlargements, so the EUs (ECs) budgets were increased. Most significantly, this act set out the plan to finish the European Single Market by the end of 1992, wanting free flow of people, assets, goods and capital. But the 1986 Act left a lot of problems unsolved. Continued below In the 1960s, De Gaulle was deeply in disagreement with other members over things like CAP (Common Agricultural Policy), the membership of the UK (which he opposed) and the prospect of majority voting (he wanted unanimity). When other states showed disagreement, he responded by a boycott of all EU meetings in the Council between July 1965 and January 1966, effectively blocking all decisions. † Norway was also supposed to join, but that was rejected in the 1972 referendum. The same thing happened in the 1994 referendum when it applied to join for a second time, leading to Norway now just being an EEA, not a full EU, member. ‡ Important reforms include the 1965 Treaty Establishing a Single Council and a Single Commission of the European Communities, the 1970 and 1975 Treaty Amending Certain Budgetary Provisions of the Treaties and Treaty Amending Certain Financial Provisions of the Treaties, and the 1976 Act Concerning the Election of the Representatives of the Assembly by Direct Universal Suffrage.',\n",
       " 'Poor planning and the difficulty of supplying the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force (MEF) certainly amplified the problems faced by General Ian Hamilton during the Gallipoli campaign, but the British (I use the term to cover all Empire forces here) ran into the same broad problems that pretty much all armies faced during the first half of the war. Namely; lack of an exploitation ability, lack of battlefield communication and troops who were neither properly trained or equipped for the fighting they faced. If the Allies couldn\\'t succeed quickly, then the inevitable First World War problem would happen. Reinforcements would be rushed in and stalemate would ensue. I\\'m going to ignore the question of whether the goal of the campaign was correct or even achievable, and focus more on what problems the British faced in trying to achieve that goal. Basically the idea was to use land forces to clear the coastal defences of the Gallipoli peninsula to allow Allied ships to clear the mines that blocked passage through the Dardanelles. To do this Hamilton was given four divisions of infantry, (29th Division the only regular division, Royal Naval Division a real hodge podge of units made up of sailors, naval base men and reserves, the 1st Australian Division and the New Zealand and Australian Division NZ&A Division) about 80,000 men. Instead of attacking at the narrowest part of the peninsula, Bulair, which was very heavily defended, Hamilton decided to land at Cape Helles in the south which was closer to the forts and where there were far fewer Ottoman units stationed, and which was further from reinforcements. Another attack was planned along the north coast at a place which became known as Anzac Cove. The attack in the north was intended to cross the peninsula in another narrow section and block off the reinforcement and escape of troops further in the south, whilst still removing the troublesome coastal forts. This in theory would only take a few days. So why didn\\'t it work? Well to start with the troops Hamilton had were far from the best. The 29th Division was by far his best formation as it was made up of units that had been garrisoning various colonies before the war and was full of veteran troops. The Royal Naval Division was more or less a New Army division, created at the wish of Winston Churchill from naval reservists and volunteers who joined in 1914. It lacked experienced officers and NCOs and apart from some of its 3rd Marine Brigade, it had no campaign experience and little training. The two Dominion divisions were little better. Also raised from volunteers of 1914 they were enthusiastic but poorly led, trained and equipped. The Cambridge Military history of Australia goes as far as to say that \"the 1st Division was probably the worst-trained formation ever sent from Australian shores.\" Although the rank and file troops were of good physical quality, their leaders were often too old and lacked campaign experience, and they suffered the same equipment deficiencies that all British forces did in 1915, particularly in machine guns, grenades, mortars and artillery. The NZ&A Division had all of the problems of the purely Australian division, with the added difficulty of being a composite force being led not by a Kiwi or Aussie, but by an English general, Sir Alexander Godley. This was put against three Ottoman divisions on the Peninsula, and with the recent memory of the Balkan wars the British vastly underestimated the fighting quality of Ottoman troops. Any military operation is difficult, but amphibious landings are probably the hardest of all and there were problems at more or less every level of the actual operation. There weren\\'t a lot of good maps, and what maps there were had to be copied, which inevitably turned out poor quality maps for most of the British forces, particularly for battalion commanders and below. Cooperation between navy and army wasn\\'t particularly good either. Neither Hamilton nor Admiral John de Robeck were great communicators and de Robeck was apparently quite indecisive, leaving it to Hamilton to make plans that involved naval cooperation, such as command over the landing beaches, the landing order of units and stores. Naval gunnery has never really been a British strong point, and it showed at the landings. Some of this though was due to the difficulty of the terrain, as the flat trajectory of naval guns couldn\\'t hit Ottoman positions on the rear of hills. As for the troops, they ran into the obvious problems. Apart from parts of the 29th Division, command and control largely broke down. Particularly in the scrubby gullies of Anzac Cove, troops became mixed up from their units, officers got lost, became casualties or simply had no idea of what to do and troops lacked the discipline and knowledge to take advantage of the almost equal level of disorganisation amongst the Ottoman defenders. Once resistance stiffened men went to ground and trenches started to be dug. Due to the chaos and heavy casualties, particularly from unopposed Ottoman artillery, the attacks stalled. Even where they were successful British troops lacked the ability to exploit that success as either they lacked clear orders or were ordered to hold their current positions until the situation became clear. Once trenches had been dug though, they pretty much stayed there, despite the best efforts of both sides. Once the British attacks had been halted they never really moved again until the evacuations over the winter. I\\'m basically of the opinion that after the first day the British lost any real chance at success, which was exceedingly slim to begin with. So TLDR; Planning failures: Lack of intelligence in maps, positions, understanding of terrain (I haven\\'t really emphasised enough how difficult it was, particularly at Anzac), lack of inter-service cooperation, lack of experienced staff officers, lack of training and experienced troops. Logistical failures: Lack of suitable artillery. Again, I haven\\'t really mentioned it enough but there artillery problems were severe. There wasn\\'t much artillery, and what there was was mostly flat trajectory field guns, not high angle firing howitzers. Hamilton and his staff were constantly begging the War Office for more howitzers and high explosive ammunition, as they had not enough of either. Water was scarce on the peninsula and had to be rationed. Fresh food was more or less unavailable which, along with poor sanitary conditions, led to high rates of disease, particularly dysentery. Lack of modern weaponry. The Ottoman forces were being supplied with German grenades and mortars while the British had neither and were forced to improvise, famously with the \\'jam tin bomb\\'. Even if the Ottomans didn\\'t have a perfect doctrine for their use, they at least had them while the British did not. And all of this was at the end of a very long supply chain. Some food and water could be acquired from places closer by like Egypt, but most military supplies had to come from Britain and took weeks or months to arrive. Planning and logistics always play a role in the outcome of a campaign, often a decisive one. Gallipoli is kind of a perfect storm of everything going wrong, including but not limited to planning and supply.',\n",

       " 'Well, i would say it\\'s likely that soldiers prayed God to succeed in battle given that basically all of them were Christians. That being said, every man of the Renaissance knew the Papacy was of double nature: an Italian princedom in temporal matters and the universal leadership of the Church in spiritual matters. So, to the Italians of the time, it wasn\\'t something new nor much of a scandal that wars could be waged by or against the Pope. Sometimes, however, when Popes went too far, a different sentiment may arise: rulers at war with the Pope may complain about the temporal power of the Church (whereas when they were loyal to the Pope, they would exalt it) and/or regard the particular Pope of the time to be unfit (this until they signed a peace treaty; anti-Papal propaganda usually ended with the war). This sentiment is more commonly found in foreign monarchies at war with the Pope rather than in Italy, where people were more used to it and accepted it. Italian or non-Italian catholic states at war with the Pope would still recognize Papal authority in moral and spiritual matters. (note that there were exceptions: some Renaissance monarchs tried to depose popes, like Louis XII of France). A bishop of a state at war with the Pope may support the country in which he is (again, remaining loyal to the Pope in spiritual matters) or stay neutral or even support the Pope, depending on the situation. This may depend on wheter the Bishop was an actual resident in the city in which he was assigned (not so common prior to the Council of Trent) or wheter he was primarily in Rome. I\\'m not aware of a Bishop blessing an army going against the Papal State. But this brings us to another topic:the inderdict. If a Pope launched an interdict, like he did against Venice, important religious rites could NOT be performed by the local church. And if a Bishop broke the interdict, you can be sure the Pope would do work to replace/depose him. This was a very powerful tool in Papal hands. Also, we have to understand the nature and scale of warfare during the Renaissance. A country like France, the most populated in W.Europe at the time, deployed about 10.000-20.000 men in very important battles. Who fought battles? The nobles of the sword and their entourage (the \"national\" part of the army) + mercenaries from all over Europe (even in French armies, there were Germans, Italians, Swiss etc). Now, being states of small size, the Italian states lacked a proper \"national\" army. They relied on Italian and non-Italian mercenaries usually led by condottieri, Italian military leaders contracted to fight wars. So they fought for money and greatness; they were very religious but religious feelings did not necessarily dominate their actions.

       " 'The scientists had worked out in pretty good detail what would happen when a nuclear bomb went off, assuming they knew the efficiency of the reaction. So they knew that if it was, say, 10 kilotons of TNT equivalent, how much of that would likely come out as blast pressure, heat, ionizing radiation, fission products, and so on. What they did not know prior to the Trinity test was how efficient the implosion bomb design they were testing was going to be. The reason for this was that the implosion design was very complex and not something that could be tested piecemeal, and the essential question was of sufficient complexity that it could not be predicted with theoretical models. It was, in other words, an engineering question: how efficient would the explosive lenses squeeze the plutonium and hold it together? Their most probable answer to this prior to the test was 4-5 kilotons, though many thought that given the number of things that could go wrong, and the complexity of the action of implosion itself, that it was possible it could be a lot lower, or even a failure. Testing the implosion bomb was the only way to actually find out exactly how well it might work prior to using it in combat. Thus the Trinity test, and it worked better than they thought, exploding with about 20 kilotons of TNT equivalent. Anyway — I hope that answers your question. It was not that they did not have a good idea of what an atomic bomb would do while exploding. And their uncertainty was limited to one particular weapon design — the implosion design (the gun-type design was much easier to test piecemeal and easier to model theoretically, and they essentially knew its probable yield very accurately without testing it). It is worth noting that there were of course many uncertainties, the most notable being how the people in a city targeted by the bomb would fare when one went off. One can say \"poorly\" but modeling exactly what would happen to them, and how many would die, and whether they would be sick from radiation, etc., was beyond their capabilities at the time. So this is the area where they expressed surprise afterwards: the number of dead was much larger than they had thought, the number killed by radiation sickness was much higher, and so on.',\n",
       " \"'Protocols of the Elders of Zion' seem to be largely based on the satirical treatise Discussion between Machiavelli and Montesqieu in Hell penned by French writer Maurice Joly in 1864. The original work was a political pamphlet aimed at the policies of Napoleon III, with no relation to Jews or anti-Semitism whatsoever. It is possible that Joly based his work on the novel Le sable du honneur' by Eugene Sue, belonging to the Les mystieres du peuple cycle and presenting a similar conspiracy undertaken by Jesuits to curb the achievements of the liberal movements of late 18th and 19th century. Again, Sue's novel does not mention Jews and has a definitely anti-clerical bent. It has also been banned by censorship in 1857, during the Second French Empire. Although the link between works of Joly and Sue, brought up by e.g. Umberto Eco is disputable, the connection between the Dicsussion... and Protocols... is pretty strong, given that large part of the former has been taken almost verbatim and some additional part has been changed slightly to better fit the general theme of a planned conspiracy rather the present state of the country, like in Joly's satire. Some historians state that almost 40% has been lifted directly from the source material, which might be quite accurate, given that large part of the Protocols... seem to contain entire paragraphs attributed to Machiavelli's answers in the original (the book is written in the manner of ancient maieutic dialogues, with persona of Montesqieu directing the course of narrative and persona of Machiavelli providing answer as carrier for the author presenting his opinion). This is very visible in e.g. 20th Dialogue and item 196 in Protocols..., where not only the same wording, but also the same percentage values are used to demonstrate the mechanism of the state loans. One of the first instances of the relations between Dialogues... and Protocols... being pointed out publicly was a brochure The Jewish Bogey and the Forged Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion written by Lucien Wolf, British journalist and diplomat, and published by Press Committee of the Jewish Board of Deputies in 1920, as a reaction to the increased interest in 'Jewish-Bolshevik threat' by anti-Semitic British journalists, and the notion that the October Revolution was caused by Jewish conspiracy. It was very possibly a direct reply to the article The Cause of World Unrest published in Morning Post in July 1920, that used aforementioned notions. In USA, William Hard also refuted credibility of Protocols... in his book The Great Jewish Conspiracy. In the next year, Irish journalist, Philip Graves, published similar article, allegedly using the materials presented by a former White Army officer, Mikhail Razslavyev. Also in 1921, Katarzyna Radziwiłł, in her article published in American Hebrew (issue of 25th February) and La Revue Mondial (issue of 15th March) stated that the Protocols... have been written in 1905, after the Russo-Japanese War (apparently not being aware of the 1903 newspaper edition), most likely by Matvey Golovinskiy, journalist and police agent working with Pyotr Rachkovskiy, whose name also appears in other discussion about the autorship of the book in question (although in the years 1902-1905 Rachkovskiy was not working in Police department, having been relieved of his duties by Minister of Interior Vyacheslav von Pleve and returned only after the death of the latter). In 1999, Russian historian Mikhail Lepyokhin noted that Golovinskiy worked in the Parisian Le Figaro with Charles Joly, son of Maurice Joly. Similar notions are presented in Portraits of Mean Men by John Dwyer, published in 1938, where author attributes the Protocols... to the Okhrana agents in Paris (Rachkovskiy was a resident agent in Paris prior to 1905) and points to large parts of the book being lifted directly from works of Joly. To elaborate on the content itself, the idea behind the 'Twelve Elders' has likely been lifted from the 1868 novel Biarritz by Hermann Goedsche under the pen name sir John Retcliffe. Two of the chapters (Jewish cemetery in Prague and The Council of the Twelve Tribes of Israel) present a shadow organization of the rabbis, who gather at an eponymous cemetery every 100 years to discuss the further actions that will help them secure their control of the world. Their methods, such as hoarding money, eroding traditions, weakening authority of the Church and sabotage of the national armies are strikingly similar to the ones presented in Protocols.... Biarritz has been translated and published in the Russian Empire in 1872, achieving moderate popularity. In addition, a book Les juifs, nos maitres! Jews, our masters! written in 1882 by French priest Emmanuel Chabauty (who later also wrote articles for first anti-Semitic periodical, L'Anti-Semitique published in the years 1883-1884) presents similar ideas of Jews attempting to control the global politics in a manner reminiscent of that presented in 'Protocols...'. The form of this publication is also similar, as it is based on a fictional letter of a Father Jean-Baptiste Bouis, allegedly exposing a 1489 letter sent by 'Jews of Arles' to 'Jews of Constantinople' and asking how to react to the increased anti-Semitic tendencies in the policies of Charles VIII of France. The letter is followed by the alleged response, where the 'Jews of Constantinople' suggest to go into hiding and infiltrate European governmental and financial structures to seize its power where possible. There are also other theories regarding the origins of the Protocols of the Elders of Sion. For example, Pierre-Andre Taguieff posits that the document has been prepared in cooperation between the French and Russian secret police to be used in both countries. Pierre Barrucand, honorary researcher affiliated with CNRS, brings forth an assumption that it has not been made by the secret police, but rather by the non-specified group of the Catholic priests (most likely French), with a strong tied to higher echelons of Vatican, possibly members of Jesuit Order, also employing tsarist courtier Yustina Glinka, who allegedly brought the manuscripts of the Protocols... from Paris. Barrucand rejects the 'police origins' of the pamphlet, noting that Rachkovskiy was a protege of the Minister of the Finances and later also Prime Minister of Russian Empire, Sergey Witte, who was later attacked as one of the 'Elders of Sion' (although this can be simply explained as an irrational conspiracy theory created by Witte's enemies). In addition, the book was published almost in a conspiracy and then presented to tsar by Sergey Nilus, what looked as an unnecessary complication, given that by 1903, anti-Semitic policies of Russsian government was a matter of fact, and many ultranationalist, conservative and fervently anti-Semitic organizations were not only operating openly, but were largely supported by highest Imperial officials including tsar himself. French historian Henri Rollin attributes the origins of the 'Protocols...' to Ilya Tsyon, Russian scholar and economist who spend last decades of 19th century in France and entered serious conflict with Russian Minister of Finances Sergey Witte over personal and professional matters. Rollin suggesting that Tsion created pasquil against Witte based on the Joly's Dialogues... that was later found or received by Rachkovskiy who remade it so that it attacked Jews instead of Witte. Any allegations of Tsion's anti-Semitism is hard to defend however, as the latter was known to defend Jews by stating in his 1892 book La Russie contemporaire that the realities and myths concerning Western Jews cannot be applied to Russian Empire, as unlike Western Jews who largely belong to middle class, Russian Jews predominantly belong to either urban worker class or rural agricultural workers living in relatively poor Jewish colonies withing Pale of Settlement, and thus are heavily disenfranchised even in comparison with poor Russians. German journalist Thomas Grüter states, that the 'Protocols...' are unlikely to have originated in Western Europe, as the book does not mention any important events that could have been used for illustration of the alleged Jewish influence, such as Franco-Prussian War, Dreyfuss Affair or the French colonial policies. Likewise, Italian literature professor Cesare de Michelis suggests that the first edition from 1903 was intended as a parody of The Jewish State by Theodor Herzl, first published in 1896 in German. This book is similar in form to the Protocols..., as it presents the rationale and proposed methods of working towards the establishment of an independent Jewish state in a series of short paragraphs or series of paragraphs, pointing to and discussing particular issues.\",\n",

Kopel does consider whether armed citizenry can prevent totalitarianism, providing only the American Revolution and the British Glorious Revolution as examples, both of which overthrew rule by non-tyrannical monarchies and are therefore not very good examples.',\n",
       " 'It seems you are asking about the background and reasons of anti-Jewish and/or anti-Semitic sentiment throughout history. Posts of this type are common on the subreddit, so we have this reply which is intended as a general response that provides an overview of the history of anti-Semitic thought and action. The essential point that needs to be emphasized: the reason for anti-Jewish hatred and persecution has absolutely nothing to do with things Jewish men and women did, said or thought. Religious and racial persecution is not the fault of the victim but of the persecutor and anti-Semitism, like all prejudices, is inherently irrational. Framing history in a manner that places the reason for racial hatred with its victims is a technique frequently employed by racists to justify their hateful ideology. The reasons why Jews specifically were persecuted, expelled, and discriminated against throughout mainly European history can vary greatly depending on time and place, but there are overarching historical factors that can help us understand the historical persecution of Jews - mainly that they often were the only minority available to scapegoat. Christian majority societies as early as the Roman empire had an often strained and complicated relationship with the Jewish population that lived within their borders. Christian leaders instituted a policy that simultaneously included grudging permissions for Jews to live in certain areas and practice their faith under certain circumstances but at the same time subjected them to discriminatory measures such as restrictions where they could live and what professions they could practice. The Christian Churches – Catholic, Orthodox, and later Protestant – also begrudgingly viewed the Jews as the people of the Old Testament but used their dominant roles in society to make the Jewish population the target of intense proselytization and other them further by preaching their fault for the death of Jesus. This dynamic meant that Jews were the most easily recognisable and visible minority to point fingers at during a crisis. This can be best observed with the frequent accusations of \"blood libel\" – an anti-Semitic canard alleging that Jews murdered Christian children to use their blood in religious rituals – in situations where Christian children or adults disappeared, the communal panic immediately channeling itself as Jew-hatred with tragic results. Similarly, religious, ideological, and economic reasons were often interwoven in the expulsion of Jews to whom medieval rulers and kings owed a lot of money; in fact, one intersection of crisis-blaming and financial motive occurred during the Black Death, when local rulers were able to cynically blame Jews for the plague as an excuse for murdering and expelling them. These processes also often took place within negotiations between social and political elites over state formation. One of the best examples is the expulsion of the Jewish population from Spain by the rulers of Castile and Aragon after the Reconquista in 1491. Expulsion and forcible conversions progressed toward an institutionalized suspicion towards so-called New Christians – Jews who’d recently converted– based on their \"blood\". This was an unprecedented element in antisemitic attitudes that some scholars place within the context of Spanish rulers and nobility becoming engaged in a rather brutal state formation process. In order to define themselves, they chose to define and get rid of a group they painted as alien, foreign and different in a negative way – as the \"other\". Once again Jews were the easily available minority. Jews long remained in this position of only available religious minority, and over time they were often made very visible as such: discriminatory measures introduced very early on included being forced to wear certain hats and clothing, be part of humiliating rituals, pay onerous taxes, live in restricted areas of towns – ghettos – and be separated from the majority population. All this further increased the sense of “other-ness” that majority societies experienced toward the Jews. They were made into the other by such measures. This continued with the advent of modernity, especially in the context of nationalism. The 19th century is marked by a huge shift in ways to explain the world, especially in regards to factors such as nationalism, race, and science. To break it down to the essentials: the French Revolution and its aftermath delegitimized previously established explanations for why the world was the way it was – a new paradigm of “rationalism” took hold. People would now seek to explain differences in social organizations and ways of living between the various peoples of the world with this new paradigm. Out of this endeavour to explain why people were different soon emerged what we today understand as modern racism, meaning not just theories on why people are different but constructing a dichotomy of worth out of these differences. A shift took place from a religious othering to one based more on nationality - and thereby, in the minds of many, on race. In the tradition of völkisch thought, as formulated by thinkers such as Gobineau and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, races as the main historical actors were seen as acting through the nation. Nations were their tool or outlet to take part in Social Darwinist competition between the races. The Jews were seen as a race without a nation - as their own race, which dates back to them being imperial subjects and older stereotypes of them as \"the other\" - and therefore acting internationally rather than nationally. Seen through this nationalistic lens, an individual Jew living in Germany, for example, was not seen as German but was seen as having no nation. For such Jews, this meant that the Jewish emancipation that Enlightenment brought provided unprecedented freedom and removed many of the barriers that they had previously experienced, the advent of scientific racism and volkisch thought meant that new barriers and prejudices simply replaced them. Racist thinkers of the 19th century augmented these new barriers and prejudices with conspiratorial thinking. The best example for this anti-Semitic delusion are the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a fake political treatise produced by the Tsarist Secret Police at some point in 1904/05 which pretends to be the minutes of a meeting of the leaders of a Jewish world conspiracy discussing plans to get rid of all the world\\'s nations and take over the world. While the Protocols were quickly debunked as a forgery, they had a huge impact on many anti-Semitic and völkisch thinkers in Europe, including some whose writings were most likely read by the young Hitler. The whole trope of the Jewish conspiracy as formulated by völkisch thought took on a whole new importance in the late 1910s, with the end of WWI, the Bolshevik revolution, and subsequent attempts at communist revolution in Germany and elsewhere. Jews during the 19th century had often embraced ideologies such as (classical) liberalism and communism, because they hoped these ideologies would propagate a world in which it didn’t matter whether you were a Jew or not. However, the idea of Jews being a driving force behind communism was clearly designed by Tsarist secret police and various racists in the Russian Empire as a way to discredit communism as an ideology. This trope of Jews being the main instigators behind communism and Bolshevism subsequently spread from the remnants of Tsarist Russia over the central powers all the way to Western Europe. This delusion of an internationalist conspiracy would finally result in the Nazis’ Holocaust killing vast numbers of Jews and those made Jews by the Nazi’s racial laws. While this form of anti-Semitism lost some of its mass appeal in the years after 1945, forms of it still live on, mostly in the charge of conspiracy so central to the modern form of anti-Semitism: from instances such as the Moscow doctors’ trial, to prevalent discourses about Jews belonging to no nation, to discourses related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to the recent surges of anti-Semitic violence in various states – anti-Semitism didn’t disappear after the end of the Holocaust. Even the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the conspiratorial pamphlet debunked soon after it was written at the beginning of the 20th century, has been consistently in print throughout the world ever since. Again, anti-Jewish persecution has never been caused by something the Jews did, said, or thought. It was and is caused by the hatred, delusions, and irrational prejudices harbored by those who carried out said persecution. After centuries of standing out due to religious and alleged racial difference, without defenders and prevented from defending themselves, Jews stood out as almost an ideal “other.” Whether the immediate cause at various points has been religious difference, conspiracy theory, ancestral memory of hatred, or simply obvious difference, Jews were and continue to be targeted by those who adhere to ideologies of hatred.

       " \"Poaching was illegal hunting was not. To go into a little more detail about the other commenter poaching consists of hunting on land which you do not own, the vast majority of suitable hunting grounds where either owned by a relatively small number of wealthy land owners or the crown. Additionally, hunting rights were limited to those who owned at leas £100 worth of land in 1671 which as a significantly greater sum at this time than it is today. On the subject of the punishment this wouldn't have been a capital crime in the 17th century however between 1723 and 1823 Britain passed through a period known as the bloody code in this case the Black Act being the most relevant. Particularly in the first half of that period as Britain's urban population was increasing while economic problems surrounding a major economic crash in 1720 caused a spike in inter-class tensions and increased fears surrounding crime and disorder among many wealthier people. Meanwhile although poaching had been a relatively common crime prior to that many people found it concerning that there seemed to be a spike in organised groups of poachers that worked together to do it and occasionally got in fire fights with gamekeepers and the like. Due to the resultant political pressure this caused and a few high profile poaching gang raids a trend involving the increase in the number of capital crimes surrounding poaching as well as other property crimes like theft increased dramatically. However, the number of executions tailed off towards the end of the 18th century as alternative punishments like transportation began to be used instead of executions while many juries where reluctant to convict people on many property crimes if they thought the defendant was likely to be executed. Eventually in 1823 changing social norms surrounding the acceptability of execution on the scale it was committed declined and the increasing viability and usefulness of transportation as a punishment as part of British empire building as well as changing class relations resulted in capital punishment becoming a mandatory sentence to a small number of crimes such as murder and treason. The number of punishments where it was an option would decline in the decades thereafter. Prior to the bloody code fines, the use of punishments like the pillory and sometimes imprisonment was more common, however for early modern governments imprisonment for long periods for large numbers of criminals was impractical simply because it was too expensive for the government to pay for that kind of thing, as such they tended to avoid using imprisonment as a punishment for most crimes with prisons largely being used for those like debtors and people awaiting trial. After the end of the bloody code in 1823 transportation was a common option for more offences and steadily overtime the government increasingly began to build up towards the modern prison system as we know it today. As for going a little more into the details why, on the one hand certainly class tensions where a major reason why hunting became restricted to wealthy land owners and the punishments for it became so harsh and certainly there where land owners who cared little for the wellbeing of the poorer people of the country but the purposes of the laws weren't in order to make sure people starved to death they were about wealthy people defending what they saw as their property rights. There's no where near enough game in Britain to support its population by making that a significant amount of a significant proportion of people's diets. Over the centuries and millennia the population had grown far about the point that was easily viable while the amount of forests had been reduced over the centuries to make room for more farmland. As a result wealthy land owners want to ensure that the stocks of game they owned weren't hunted to the point there were few if any left on their land leaving them with less to hunt for themselves. I would suggest that potentially that hunting also people less reliant on state and capital structures and institutions as a social threat but i'd have to look into that topic more to decide if there's enough evidence to support that kind of notion being significant.\",\n",

       " \"This is an extremely difficult question to tackle - but interest in this subject is such that it attracts a range of efforts. First, we are not likely to be able to link legends (stories told generally to be believed) with actual events tied to the last glaciation. The best case I have seen are efforts to see references to glacial-era islands that disappeared with rising ocean levels: such stories have been recorded in Australia and may be linked to events that occurred roughly 12,000 years ago To achieve this sort of continuity in oral tradition, one would need an extremely stable population and culture. What exists in indigenous Australia is largely unmatched elsewhere, so finding traditions that speak specifically to one's own backyard as legendary accounts, reaching back to the Pleistocene, is not likely to be very common. That said, there have been efforts to track folktales (stories that are typically told as fiction, not to be believed) into a deep past. Some of these efforts follow the so-called phylogenetic modeling of scholars such as Julien d’Huy. He has used a method comparable to what is employed by geneticists to track variations in widespread narratives to determine age and origin/distribution. When he can claim to have evidence of narratives from both hemispheres, he can advance his hypothesis that a story descends from a common ancestor that predates migrations to the New World - pushing its origin back into the glacial period. He uses this approach with the Polyphemus story (Tale Type ATU 1137), which appears in the Odyssey when Ulysses escapes from the cyclopes. Not everyone agrees with this method, but it offers some of the most convincing evidence of something that may have survived that long. Using a different method, there have been efforts to suggest that there is a similar distribution for a story about a great hunt a story associated with Ursa Major (the Big Dipper). According to these range of stories, there was once an epic hunt that was so remarkable, it is memorialized as a constellation - sometimes the Big Dipper and sometimes the Belt of Orion. This analysis is also thought provoking but not accepted universally. Opportunities to pursue stories along the lines that your question seeks are extremely rare: most stories have more limited distribution; even when similar stories are found on Eurasia and the Americas, we must question as to whether we are looking at independent invention rather than diffusion and descent from a common ancestor. Nevertheless, the stories pursing this question are not without their merit and I find them quite exciting.\",\n",

So, if you are asking whether they considered professional military experience as a requirement for the presidency, the answer is no. However, they did expect that every president would have military experience in the form of militia service. In classical republican theory, a state mandated and controlled militia of local males with ties to their communities was essential to defending the polity while avoiding the threats of despotism posed by professional armies.

       " \"Yes, there absolutely was a definition - in fact, Marxists (and communists more specifically) were quite distinctive in actually producing contemporary theories of what fascism was and how to define it during the 1920s and 1930s. The issue was that this definition emphasised the capitalistic roots of the ideology, viewing fascism as the inevitable final stage of capitalistic development where the system relied on brute force to prolong itself in the face of crisis. There's a famous summary given by Georgi Dimitrov (and given at a world congress of the Third International, so very much reflected the 'official' Soviet line): Fascism is neither the government beyond classes nor the government of the petty bourgeois or the lumpen-proletariat over the financial capital. Fascism is the government of the financial capital itself. It is an organized massacre of the working class and the revolutionary slice of peasantry and intelligentsia. Fascism in its foreign policy is the most brutal kind of chauvinism, which cultivates zoological hatred against other peoples. The issue with this definition is that if fascism was the inevitable consequence of capitalism, anyone seeking to support a capitalistic system was supporting fascism, and were therefore fascist in effect, if not in name. As such, groups like social democrats, who helped prop up the capitalist system in the face of communist revolutionary efforts, became 'social fascists' in communist parlance. The idea was to force the working class to choose between revolution or fascist dictatorship, rather than seek to prolong the failing capitalist system.

The main difference seem to be European ones rarely had words as the main symbol on their banners, while kanji characters are common on Japanese ones, which is not surprising due to the difference in the written language. A single kanji can easily represent a family or clan, but a character from the Latin alphabet can not. The European practice of marshalling heraldries to show desendence and inheritance isn't practiced in Japan, but those super complex heraldries don't seem to show up on the battlefield banners anyway. If anything, European early-modern national flags in battle (stripes and crosses everywhere) were often much less complex than Japanese heraldry, and also compared to Japanese depictions where flags and banners were literally everywhere, European flags and banners were few and far between.\",\n",
       " \"Although it might seem like overkill to use the heavy guns of the Bismarck-class battleships against merchant ships, there were both military and political reasons for the Kriegsmarine (KM) to do so. The strategic situation confronting the KM in early 1941 held out some promise for the Germans, but was also daunting on a number of levels. On the positive side, the Fall of France had not only eliminated French naval power in the Mediterranean, but it also allowed for German access to French naval bases. Moreover, some new construction of heavy units was making good on some of the earlier losses sustained in Norway. Nonetheless, there were some troubling factors on the horizon. The KM naval planners rightly figured that the expansion of American neutrality patrols signaled the increasing chances of American belligerency. The prospect of a American heavy units joining the British would mean that Germany's already outnumbered surface fleet would be dwarfed. The Italian Regia Marina meanwhile was proving not as effective of an ally that its raw numbers suggested and German naval planners had to contend with the Italian fleet not being able to tie down significant numbers of British warships in the Mediterranean. Part of the impetus for Operation Rheinübung- the Bismarck task force- in May 1941 was to strike with the heavy units of the KM while it still could. KM chief Raeder had timed the operation to coincide with the invasion of Crete in the hope of pushing British heavy units in multiple directions. This was in keeping with earlier naval strategy of using surface units to keep the numerically-superior RN off-balance while disrupting British trade. Part of the rationale for detailing Bismarck to convoy-hunting was that British strategic convoys had also begun to detail heavy surface units for their escorts. The idea was the fast and heavily-armed battleship could not only lap up the merchants and break up the convoy, but also destroy their escorts as well. Of course, there was a significant amount of caution involved in this strategy. The directive for Rheinübung laid out in clear terms that: The primary mission of this operation also is the destruction of the enemy's merchant shipping; enemy warships will be engaged only when that primary mission makes it necessary and it can be done without excessive risk. Rheinübung's commander Vice Admiral Günter Lütjens was pessimistic about the operation's chances of success and pleaded for it to be postponed until either newly-launched Tirpitz or damaged Gneisenau could join the task force. Lütjens recognized that this sort of asymmetrical warfare with heavy units was a risky proposition in light of Britain's absolute numerical superiority. Raeder managed to eventually win over Lütjens for the smaller task force, but Rheinübung's commander still remained pessimistic about the overall mission, which explains some of his behavior after the encounter with Hood and Prince of Wales. One of the reasons that Raeder was insistent on Rheinübung was that the operation's success would have reflected well on the KM's surface fleet. The KM not only had to contend with both British and American naval power in its 1941 strategic formulations, but also the impending war with the USSR. Such a war signaled a further loss of funding for the surface fleet and a sidelining of the KM in Germany's war effort. While Hitler was amenable to battleships as a symbol of German power and prestige, he was also sensitive to their loss and the symbolic impact it would have on Germany's prestige. Hitler flirted with the idea of cancelling Rheinübung on a 22 May naval conference and Raeder's memoirs claimed that the KM chief managed to sway the dictator not to abort the mission. Even though Raeder and other naval planners were aware of the risks associated with sorties by the surface fleet, they did not want the navy to simply remain in port. As veterans of the Imperial Navy, the memory of a port-bound battlefleet of the Kaiser rusting away in idleness cast a long shadow over planners like Raeder. Sorties by the surface fleet were a means to keep in the game, so to speak. While the KM's battleships could not tackle the numerically superior British fleet, convoys were a much plausible target. Waiting for more surface units would only mean that the British naval strength would only get stronger with American aid while the surface fleet played an increasingly peripheral role in Germany's war effort. Merchant convoys were the only quarry within the reach of the KM surface fleet's capabilities, so they built a strategy around this reality. Fittingly, Rheinübung had much the impact the pessimists like Lütjens feared. Hitler subsequently became more cautious with the surviving battlefleet. The idea that surface units could break up convoys also was much harder than it was in theory; experience with Scharnhorst and Gneisenau showed that escorts could interfere with the KM surface ships long enough for a convoy to move out of position. The British also had an abundance of heavy units to spare to deal with the threat of a German battleship or battlecruiser. Tirpitz did make several attempts to intercept the Arctic convoys, but KM naval directives as well as fuel shortages meant that Tirpitz's operational range was much more limited to areas where there was German aircover and proximity to German-controlled ports. Rather than being a powerful battleship, she was much more of a naval scarecrow.\",\n",
       " 'You\\'re missing the biggest point here: the chinese civil war. China was divided since 1911 in several regions dominated by warlords, with a central republic dominated by the nationalistic Kuomintang Party and its leader Chiang kai shek. From 1927 another player came into the play, the chinese communist party, that openly fought the Kuomintang. Being routed from several cities and persecuted, in 1935 the communists started what become known as the \"Long March\", retiring all their forces and equipments in the north, towards the Manchurian/Japanese Frontier. Here, when the Japanese invaded China in 1937, they were one of the most reliable defences against the invasion, while the Kuomintang forces lost battle after battle and city after city, for several reasons. Here there was a real teuce between the two chinese factions, in order to fight the foreign invasor. And of course the USA helped the Kuomintang with aircraft and weapons, not the chinese communists. That\\'s why, when after the war the communists reprised and won the civil war, they had\\'t really a good reason to thank the USA. Also, cold war and soviet influence.

       " 'My area of expertise lies within the European Union\\'s institutions, so I\\'ll discuss the differences between Council of the European Union and the European Council and why each body exists, drawing largely from Ludger Kuhnhardt\\'s European Union: The Second Founding (2nd Revised Edition, Baden-Baden, Nomos Verlaggesellschaft 2010), which I find to be a comprehensive overview of the constitutional evolution of the EU, and the Treaty on European Union (Luxembourg, Publications Office of the European Union, 2010) for information on the responsibilities and powers of the institutions themselves. The Basics of Each Institution To start, the Council of Europe is separate from the Council of the European Union and the European Council. The Council of Europe is an intergovernmental organization with 47 members within Europe: all countries on the European continent except Belarus, Kazakhstan, and the Vatican. The Council of the European Union and the European Council, along with the European Commission, the European Parliament, the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Central Bank, and the Court of Auditors, are institutions of the European Union, which has 27 member-states. The Council of the European Union (referred to in the Treaty on European Union as \"The Council\") was established with the European Union in 1993 with the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty. The Council, as set out in Article 16 of the Treaty on European Union has both a legislative role (alongside the European Parliament, the Council votes on legislation proposed by the European Commission) and a policymaking and agenda-setting role (the rotating presidency of the Council establishes different priorities for each six-month term). The Council consists of a representative of each EU member-state at the ministerial level and its presidency rotates between member-states (Portugal currently holds the presidency). The Council has its roots in the three supranational bodies within the European Communities (EC): the European Coal and Steel Community, the European Economic Community, and the European Atomic Energy Community, or EURATOM. Each organization had a similar institutional structure, including a Council of Ministers, comprised of government ministers from each member-state. In many ways, the European Council is an outgrowth of the Council of the European Union and its predecessor institutions in the EC. Today, the European Council is the newest institution of the European Union, having been formalized in the Lisbon Treaty in 2009. Article 15 of the Treaty on European Union charges the European Council with providing \"the Union with the necessary impetus for its development and defining... the general political directions and priorities thereof.\" It is comprised of the heads of state or government of the EU\\'s member states, its own president (currently Charles Michel), and the President of the European Commission (currently Ursula von der Leyen). The European Council meets rather infrequently --twice every three months-- and in special meetings when required, and when you hear about late-night summits in Brussels involving the different Presidents and Prime Ministers of EU member states, those are meetings of the European Council. From Informal Summit to European Institution The European Council\\'s origins go back to 1974, though, when French President Valery Giscard d\\'Estaing convened a summit of the heads of state and government of EC member-states in Paris. The member-states would later agree to hold regular meetings, first three times a year, then two, then four, in accordance with the rotating EC presidency. The European Council\\'s meetings were, at this point, conducted outside of the Rome Treaties, so decisions taken at these summits had no effect within the EC\\'s legal structure. That said, the European Council did take important decisions in the late \\'70s: in 1978, the European Council decided to adopt the European Monetary System, an important step towards the adoption of the Euro. Under the Single European Act, the European Council would be given recognition in the EC\\'s legal structure, but would not become its own institution, separate from the Council of the European Union until 2009. In many ways, in order to understand the European Council and why it exists today, you have to understand the move towards a European Constitution. The move towards becoming a separate institution can be described as a process of Europeanization and constitutionalization. The Maastricht Treaty, which established the European Union serves as a useful demarcation line between the two forces. While increased federalism, economic integration, and a common market had been on the agenda since the early days of the EC, events of the early 1970s exposed the need for further cooperation and harmonization. The 1973 Yom Kippur War and subsequent OPEC blockade and the collapse of the Bretton Woods system exposed large differences within the member-states’ economic systems. The signing of the New Atlantic Charter in Ottawa in 1973 reinforced a feeling of European dependency on the United States. As the ‘70s progressed into the ‘80s, the rise of the “Asian Tiger” economies coupled with a general economic downturn in Europe threatened European economic competitiveness. Kuhnhardt (167-168) identifies four “robust and sustainable” European interests that emerge during this time: 1. That a common market would require a common currency, which would be dependent on a series of legally binding harmonizing measures to ensure the functioning of a single market. 2. The common market would require solidarity mechanisms to allocate resources to ensure balance across all regions of the community, especially as the community enlarged. 3. The development of further institutions beyond the original structures in the Rome Treaties would be necessary to strengthen the legitimacy of European integration. 4. The European Community would need to raise its international profile and begin making steps towards developing a common foreign policy. It is in point 3 where we can see the roots of the European Council germinate. The growth of the EC up until the 1970s saw the Commission struggle in its role and the Council and the European Parliament struggle to balance the representation of the interests of the member-states on one hand with the representation of the interests of EC citizens on the other. Giscard d’Estaing’s decision to establish regular summit meetings was one of the first steps to ensure the EC could act decisively in light of those four European interests. In 1987, the Single European Act took effect, incorporating the European Council into the legal structure of the EC, but its function and form remained undefined. The Single European Act also charged the EC with realizing a single market by 1993, paving the way for the Maastricht Treaty and the establishment of the European Union. At the same time negotiations in Maastricht began, new challenges began to present themselves in Europe: enlargement and expansion in Central and Eastern Europe behind the old Iron Curtain, Europe finding its place in a post-Cold War world order, and the belief that the EC and its institutions suffered from a “democratic deficit.” While the Maastricht Treaty established three pillars within the European Union (the Common Market, Foreign Policy, and Justice and Home Affairs policy) and strengthened the EU’s institutions, we begin to see the emergence of constitutional questions in the 1990s. Among those questions is one that seems simple at first, but is actually vital: who speaks for Europe. Additionally, the institutional, legal, and policymaking structures of the EU and the EC were highly opaque and complicated. It is in light of these questions we see multiple treaty revisions post-Maastricht, first in Amsterdam in 1997 and then in Nice in 2000. In December 2001, the European Council met in Laeken, Belgium and issued the Laeken Declaration, which defined several mandates for reform and called for a European Constitutional Convention, to draft a true constitutional treaty for the EU. I won’t go into great detail about the European Constitutional Convention and the resultant Constitutional Treaty, since doing so would run afoul of the 20-Year-Rule. Voters in France and the Netherlands rejected the Constitutional Treaty in referenda, and treaty was abandoned. Two years later, the EU began the process of drafting a new quasi-constitutional treaty, which we now know as the Treaty of Lisbon. The Treaty of Lisbon established many of the things the Constitutional Treaty set out to do, while removing many of the constitutional and state-like features of the Constitutional Treaty. Among the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon were articles that established the European Council as a full institution of the EU, with a permanent President, who can serve two two-and-a-half year terms. The President of the European Council is also responsible (alongside the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, essentially the EU’s Foreign Minister).',\n",
       " \"The main problematic premise of OP is the imbalance of the survival chance of such kind of secular building and that of the religious one. It is famous that Charlemagne had a very big bathhouse as a part of his royal palace complex in Aachen, as narrated by his biographer, Einhard: 'He took delight in the stream produced by natural hot springs, and he kept his body fit by regular swimming, at which he was so accomplished that no one could be considered better than he. It was indeed on account of this that he built his palace at Aachen and that he lived there constantly in the last years of his life and right up to his death. He invited not only his sons into the bath but also his luminaries and friends, and even his personal followers and his bodyguards, so that on occasion there might be a hundred or more men bathing together' (Einhard, the Life of Charles the Emperor, Chap. 22, Noble trans. 2009: 40f.). Archaeologists and architects reconstructed the lost entire complex of his palace (the following URL is linked to CG reconstruction, used in the historical documentary produced by ZDF), and the extant chapel is only a part of this complex. The most important part of the complex, the Royal Great Hall (Aula regia), however, was turned into the City Hall of Aachen later in course of the Middle Ages: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Die_Aachener_Kaiserpfalz_(CC_BY-SA_4.0).webm On the other hand, archaeological excavations has revealed the size of some longhouses in Viking Age Scandinavia resided by the chieftain and also used as a group banquet/ feast, as I mentioned briefly recently in Viking town structure : The biggest one, from Northern Norway, was 83 meters longs and one archaeologist also estimated 9 meters high. Another bigger one, found in Lejre, Sjælland in Denmark, was also over 60 meters long.

       " \"Yes, definitely. Large buildings can be seen as a show of power, wealth and authority, on top of their more practical uses, and therefore reflect the power structures of a region. When it comes to the middle ages, the most powerful classes were, of course, the church and the nobility. Therefore, the most commonly built large stone buildings, and specially those that last until this day, are palaces and castles associated with the nobility (usually of military use) and religious buildings, like abbeys or cathedrals, associated with the church. However, they were not the only ones. Observing large historic buildings you can also see the rise of the urban merchant classes in different regions of Europe, as we can appreciate in the great town halls of the Hanseatic League, Flanders, and Italy. Personally, my favorite examples of neither religious nor military buildings of the (late) middle ages are the Consolats de Mar popularized (but not invented) by the Crown of Aragon, centers from where commercial law was administered, and which could be seen all across Aragonese territories in the Mediterranean Sea, in port cities like Valencia and Palma de Majorca and which showed the level of administrative sophistication of the kingdom. There where other consulates of the sea throughout the Mediterranean, but I don't think they were under Catalan or Aragonese jurisdiction, and on which I've struggled to find proper sources.\",\n",
       " \"Yes. So when it comes to medieval architecture, most of my background is in Spanish Medieval Architecture so my examples will come from there. Though some of the most famous examples of Medieval Architecture are religious (Mosque of Cordaba, Madrasa of Granada, Santa Maria Del Mar, Monastary of San Juan de la peña) there are some beautiful governmental and civil buildings. For example to palace-fort of Alhambra is a masterpiece of late Moorish Architecture. There are also the Lonja de la Seda which was a mercantile building that was built in the Gothic style as well as the Barcelona Royal Port. Both the Moorish and Gothic styles lent themselves to beautiful palaces. The Romanesque style was much more austere and I don't know of many significant non-religious buildings of the style other the El Palacio de Los Reyes de Navarra. This is not a perfect answer and I don't know too much more, but I hope this at least can show you that all of the major architectural styles of the European Middle Ages were implemented in a variety of different types of buildings. I also know that this definitely holds true for the Indian Middle Ages and Imperial Chinese. Many of those palaces and forts are still very popular tourist attractions to this day.\",\n",

       " \"The rise of the United States as a dominant power covers a long period of time, so I'll just give a relatively brief summary of the events that lead up to it. Also, this is by no means comprehensive, as there were multiple powers (pre-1871 Prussia, the Russian Empire and Austria) that came close to rivalling the major dominant powers. For most of modern and early modern history, world politics were largely dominated by the Anglo-French rivalry. Though their relative power, both to one another and to other major powers fluctuated, they were the main world powers. Britain, through their naval supremacy, controlled the seas and therefore the largest colonial Empire while France was the leading power on the European continent, especially under Louix XIV and Napoleon I. There is a reason why the two periods of time that more or less coincided with the lead up to WW1 are popularly called the Napoleonic period (after French emperor Napoleon) and the Victorian period (after Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom). When the German coalition under Prussian leadership decisively crushed France in 1871 during the Franco-Prussian war, the newly united country of Germany established itself as a major power and soon established its own colonial empire that rapidly became the third largest after the UK and France. By this time, the United States was one of the most industrialised countries and a huge economic powerhouse, but it was far from a military power yet. When the United States joined World War One in 1917, their military was largely underdeveloped and a large part of their materiel, most importantly tanks and machine guns, were supplied by the UK and France. United States 'doughboys', as the American troops were cold, famously used British Brody helmets (apart from the Harlem Hellfighters, who used French Adrian helmets) and French Renault FT tanks and Chauchat light machine guns. From 1914 to 1917, the Americans were officially neutral, but supported the Entente powers of France, UK and Russia through their sophisticated industry, which helped further establish the US as a major centre of wealth and industry. Conversely, WW1 pushed the European economies to their absolute limit. The UK, France and Germany suffered 8.8, 8.6 and 13.2 million casualties against 4.4 million for the US. Considering that the US is several times larger than any of the other countries, the US economy came out on top. This is where the balance of power starts to shift and the United States starts to be considered as a major power in international politics. However, WW1 also marked the point where both the British and the French empires were at their absolute peak, since they gained mandates to govern parts of the Middle-East from the League of Nations, and also split the former German colonies among them. Though Germany was crushed, it also managed to recover surprisingly quickly and covertly developed a military machine that would crush its main rival in France with surprising speed in 1940. Historians Ian Sumner and François Vauvillier note that in 1939, before the invasion of France, the French army was still believed to be the most advanced and the most powerful. Why Germany managed to so quickly defeat France is a whole different topic that I won't get into now. World War II is what marked the true beginning of American hegemony. Europe was largely left ruined after both World Wars and the end of the war coincides with various decolonisation movements that, for obvious reasons, affected UK and France the most. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union had emerged as a rival to the US, both in might and in influence. I'll stop here because I feel you're likely familiar with the more contemporary post-WW2 and Cold War history. TL;DR: The end of WW1 established the US as a major power, and the end of WW2 established the US as the major power alongside the USSR. The fall of the USSR in 1991 meant that the US was the main powerbroker in the world. Hope any of this is useful. &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; Sources (among others): Sumner, I. Vauvillier, F.

       " 'There is a zero percent chance. They are completely separate groups, from different times and different geographies. They spoke languages in separate groups, albeit both Indo-European (the Saxons were a Germanic people, while the Scythians were in the Indo-Iranian group, with a lot of mixture with Samartian, Siberian groups, Khotanese, etc.) Their material cultures were completely separate. That their names vaguely sound similar is just a coincidence. The typical ancient terms for Scythians are Σκύθης (Greek), Skudra, Sug(u)da. All of these come from the Proto-Indo-European root (s)kewd-, meaning \"shoot.\" Their name for themselves seems to have been skuda, \"archer,\" which fits with their preferred style of fighting. The word Saka for them is from Old Persian root sak- \"go, roam,\" probably meaning \"nomad.\" The Saka were technically distinct from Scythians, being Iranian/\"Persian\" by language and culture. The origin of the name \"Saxon\" is unknown, but most think it relates to a type of knife weapon, the seax in Old English (sax in German and Old Norse). There are multiple spellings and terms for the \"Saxons\" in Roman sources, with Saxōnēs being the most accepted.',\n",
       " 'I am not an expert in this field, but I can speak with some experience to say there was no objection to being Catholic or Protestant (mainly Lutheran in Germany) in the National Socialist Party and the Wehrmacht - former Reichswehr (German Army). Yes, you can find the SS slowly working against this over time, but from my own opinion, I would characterize this as a power struggle and not something so ideologically ground. That sounds odd since it is obviously an ideological struggle, but the clergy in Germany were essentially the only group able to stand up to the Nazis and as such the SS - the sword of the party so to speak - would need to root this out. They never quite got to that stage, but the grounds were being laid. In any case, Christianity had strong ties to National Socialism, thus any member could openly practice. Without hindrance. I mainly studied the officer corps of the German Army in WWI and can say religious observance and practice was integral to the German military. There was no separating these two whatsoever. Even Jews in the German army (WWI Kaiserheer) were allowed to openly practice their religion and were buried with honors and religious rights in cemeteries in Berlin (among other cities). They are still there by the way and amazing to see. In any case, being that the Nazi party and the Officer Corps were always in a way kept separate, I see no reason why religious observance would be prevented. But it\\'s also important to look at it from two other ways: &#x200B; 1. &#x200B; Christians who bought into the National Socialism as an ideology saw it as a logical conclusion to the larger racial sciences born from the 19th century. That is to say, many saw Aryans (themselves) as not just the purist race but the purest christian race and as such, needed to purify Germany as Luther had called for in the 16th century and as Catholics had been calling for..for a long time (see, Houston Stewart Chamberlain The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century). Even for those religious in the SS, seen through this lens it could very well be justified to exterminate Untermenschen in order to secure their religion and country. I am simplifying this greatly, but this is one aspect. 2. I feel by your post you are somewhat surprised or skeptical, perhaps? Sorry if I am assuming anything, but if this is true, it may be because you have been lead to believe that Nazis were against religion or were for their own form of religion. This is absolutely untrue on the whole. If you want to find atheist texts, quotes, or members, feel free, but this does not means National Socialism was inherently atheist. You can find homosexual Nazis, doesn\\'t mean they were for homosexuality. You can find Nazis who made excuses to save Jews, doesn\\'t mean they wanted to save Jews. Etc. etc. Was it because the ideology already fell in line with so many christians views? Sort of. A broad generalization though. Perhaps it is just the pragmatic side: Germans were observant Christians and you cannot go gaining power while offending 99% of the country. Instead you find ways to exploit and use them, especially if there were plenty of organizations willing to join in the early 30s. Christianity, especially Catholicism, had strong roots in German Nationalism and Antisemitism in Germany. I am loathe to cite Wikipedia, but for a quick read check out the Deutsche Zentrumpartei This political party, though not overtly Catholic per se in its ideological drive, is the single reason the Nazis came to power. This isn\\'t to lay any blame on Catholics - this falls to Hindenburg - but just so you can see the joint nature of German Catholicism, politics, and National Socialism. There is also the Deutsche Christen though less is available in the English wikipedia you can get the picture. This is just a rough outline, but don\\'t forgot the Nazis were only in power for 6 years before war broke out and a further 4.5 after that. Half of which \"in power\" means Total War. There isn\\'t a lot of wiggle room to set the foundations for subverting the power dynamic of the Christian Church. I would highly suggest reading Richard J. Evans\\' books The Coming of the Third Reich and The Third Reich in Power for more insight into the developments within Germany. He doesn\\'t give a view solely on Christianity in Nazi Germany, but it is present and you can see how the instances of Christian persecution were very targeted. I have also found his style of writing easy going for those not used to reading academic texts.',\n",

       " 'During the Ancien Regime, Parisien-French was first made the legal language of the state as per the 1539 Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêt (article 111) that replaced Latin with French with the goal of centralizing the state, however the ordinance did not clearly define what langage maternel francoys was since there existed many dialects of mainstream Parisien-French used by the monarchy based in Île-de-France (Paris). The farther you went outside of the royal capital Paris, the more different the local French dialect (called patois) would become. For example in the so-called Francien linguistic zone around Île-de-France, there existed the Orléanais dialect, Tourangeau dialect, however these were all mutually intelligible with Parisien, but once you left this zone in the north-central France heartland, you would enter areas like Champagne, Poitou, Artois/Picardy, Lorraine, Burgundy, Normandy etc. where the spoken vernacular differed from Parisien-French. These languages in Northern France were called langues d\\'oïl (oïl/oui the word for \"yes\" all these languages shared) and it\\'s difficult to state whether they were all to some degree \\'mutually intelligible\\', as regional languages such as Norman had significant differences in vocabulary resulting from retaining old-French words and Anglo-Norse influence. But in general the languages were not foreign/alien sounding to each-other, and a Parisien speaker would be able to understand a majority of the spoken language. In the south, there were the langue d\\'oc languages (oc was their word for \"yes\") which were essentially dialects of the Occitan language, itself a Gallo-Romance language. In the east there was Franco-Provençal/Arpitan language, that formed another group within Gallo-Romance. Norman: Tous les houmes nâquissent libres et parels dans leux dignité et en dreits. Il ont bien de la conschienche et de la raison et il deivent faire d\\'ot leux préchains coume si ch\\'éteit pour yeux mêmes. Parisien: Tous les êtres humains naissent libres et égaux en dignité et en droits. Ils sont doués de raison et de conscience et doivent agir les uns envers les autres dans un esprit de fraternité. In this cross-example of Norman with Parisien, some of the vowels are changed and syntax may be a bit different but overall it\\'s clear they are related languages and to some degree mutually intelligible. This can help you understand the differences between them. As for the the geographic spread of Parisien-French by the time of the French revolution, it had expanded over the last three centuries as a result of Villers-Cotterê, which had the effect of making the literary language throughout France become in Parisien, instead of the vernacular, in addition to the language of the state/law. So there was a decline in usage of local patois in Northern France, and urban centers where French royal authority was enforced became Parisien-speaking although a majority of France remained rural/agrarian by 1789 so the patois remained spoken in the countryside. For example in Roussillon, where Catalan was spoken, the regional city of Perpignan/Perpinyà became French speaking by 1789, but the countryside remained very culturally Catalan. The royal government did not make it a priority to enforce Parisien because there was little way to apply that policy at the time (without public schools for example) and they were more concerned with maintaining the political allegiance of Catalans, as opposed to culturally assimilating them, and additionally the language of the lower-classes in the countryside (shepherds, farmers etc.) did not matter to the royal government as long as they remained loyal to the state. Most non-French regional areas under the Ancien Regime enjoyed considerable cultural autonomy as was the case with Basque region (a border-frontier zone) where the Basque fiefdoms of Basse-Navarre, Labourd, Soule and Béarn, and local Basque laws were allowed under the centuries old foruak (home-rule) system, which was later abolished by the French Republicans. In Brittany, where the Breton language was spoken by a vast majority of the population, the Edict of Union of 1532 guaranteed local autonomy to Bretons with an Estates of Brittany and continuation of the duchy, and this state was legally abolished by the French Republicans. Pre-1789 almost all lower-class Basques and Bretons were monolingual speakers of their native languages, and Parisien-French was not enforced on the majority of the population. On the eve of the French revolution, around half of the French population had knowledge of Parisien and a quarter were monolingual speakers. The other half spoke their regional languages. So the Parisien dialect of French from 1539 to 1789 had become widespread in urban areas across the country, and this made it possible for the French Republicans to build their culturally homogenous nation-state. It took considerable time for regional languages to decline, and it was over the course of the 19th century with the advent of public schools, industrialization and internal migration when standard French replaced local languages and dialects. An interesting fact is that after wars, such as WW1 for example, when soldiers returned home to their regions they preferred using French because they had a greater French identity from their service in the army. This was a factor in the decline of the Breton language, from a region that contributed the most soldiers during WW1 in proportion to its population.',\n",

       " \"So, this requires a little background. Manly P. Hall (1901-1990) got his start as a preacher in 1919; his mother had been involved with occultism and the young Hall delved deep into pretty much every form of religion, magic, and mysticism he could get his hands on, according to Master of the Mysteries: The Life of Manly Palmer Hall. His personal charisma and erudition attracted patrons with deep pockets, who financed his travels and deeper learning. One of the products of this was publication, and his magnum opus was Secret Teachings of All the Ages , which wasn't quite as all-encompassing as Lewis Spence's An Encyclopaedia of Occultism , but pretty lengthy. Secret Teachings of All the Ages can basically be summed up as a gloss of the history of (mostly) Western occultism; Hall uncritically condenses and regurgitates the apocryphal myths of the founding of the Freemasons, the Rosicrucians, and other groups. This differs from contemporary movements like Theosophy in that Hall doesn't really synthesize a lot of this material, at least not to the same degree as the theosophists did, and makes little pretense of having new revelations beyond unveiling all the legends and lore he's already put together - which is, to be fair, no small feat. For a comparison, you might look at my answer on I’d like to know more about the Theosophy movement Hall does cite a few theosophists in Secret Teachings, but doesn't seem to have absorbed the full text of The Secret Doctrine or Isis Unveiled, or at least doesn't make the effort to fully incorporate Theosophy into his accounting of the occult history of the world, picking and choosing bits that suit his thesis. Refuting any individual part of the book isn't necessarily difficult, but it's almost entirely a mishmash of legends and ideas that had already been in circulation for years or centuries, so the sheer amount of material to be refuted can be a little daunting. For example, if you look at Hall's chapter on Atlantis it is basically a summary of those myths and ideas about Atlantis which were then current, especially leaning in on Ignatius Donnelly's Atlantis: The Antediluvian World . My answer to How did the Atlantis myth begin? hits on most of the key points from the early part of Hall's section on Atlantis; the only difference being that Hall assumes Atlantis was real to some extent despite the original evidence clearly showing it's fictional, and keeps on going. Which is really characteristic of a many occult writers of the period. There are too many claims in any given amount of text to do a full debunking of each one, and even trying to do that quickly becomes tiresome. While Hall isn't particularly good with his citations in this volume, most of the works he does cite or quotes aren't accredited histories but other occult compilations, the Bible, antiquated anthropological texts, etc. Much of the book simply summarizes or restates material from other books; the section on Ceremonial Magic and Sorcery for example is basically just a gloss of the work of Eliphas Levi.\",\n",
       " 'There are actually a few examples of this very practice, and the risks that came with it. I\\'ll start with the sons of Henry II of England. Henry and his wife, Eleanor, had four legitimate sons who reached adulthood. The eldest, Henry the Young King, and the third, Geoffrey, Duke of Brittany, were known to participate in Tournaments. There are also stories about Richard, but most of those are from later sources and are romanticized to the point of being total fantasy. Now, a Twelfth Century tournament was quite a bit different from how we think of tournaments now. Jousting was more of an exhibition event, rather than the main focus, and the real main event was a melee in which combatants would fight on horseback or on foot with the goal of taking each other \"captive\" by disarming or forcing the other to yield. This is a bit closer to how tournaments are depicted in Merlin, though Merlin tends more towards a series of one-on-one duels. The main point of a tournament during this period was to practice for the real battlefield. The social and cultural values of the medieval aristocracy of England and France at the time dictated that nobles did not often kill one another, even in regular combat, so death on the tournament grounds may not have been much of a concern (though certainly not completely ignored). Henry the Young King participated extensively in tournaments across Northern France as a means of increasing his wealth and chivalric reputation. Matthew Strickland, biographer of Henry the Young King, discusses the Young King\\'s tournament career at length, and its impact on chivalric culture surrounding tournaments: &#x200B; Before the Young King, kings of England had not patronized or personally participated in the tournament. Henry II permitted tournaments to be held on the borders of Normandy, but had strictly prohibited them in England, fearing they would be a source of potential disorder and rebellion. In doing so, he was re-establishing a similar ban imposed by Henry I, which had lapsed during the troubles of Stephen\\'s reign. Henry II, like his grandfather, was a brave and seasoned warrior, but considerations of status and regal dignity, as much as concerns for personal safety, kept him aloof from tourneying himself. Henry II\\'s reticence was shared by the kings of France. Louis VII was not a martial king, but neither Philip Augustus nor his son Louis VIII would participate in tournaments despite much campaigning in actual warfare. Strickland then includes a quote from Ralph of Diss, a chronicler of the day: Young King Henry, the king\\'s son, left England and passed three years in tournaments, spending a lot of money. While he was rushing all over France he put aside the royal majesty and was transformed from a king into a knight, carrying off victory in various meetings. His popularity made him famous; the old king was happier counting up and admiring his victories, and although the Young King was still under age his father restored in full his possessions which he had taken away. Strickland continues after the block-quote: Far from disapproving of his son\\'s involvement, Henry II took paternal pride in his high-profile sporting achievements and was more than willing to bankroll the Young King\\'s tourneying activities. For he realized that the tournament provided young Henry and his companions with a vital safety valve through which to exercise their martial aggression, as well as a means for his son to enhance his status and reputation. Thus preoccupied, the Young King might be less minded to press his father for direct rule of any part of the Angevin dominions... Henry II fully recognized that the Young King\\'s lavish patronage of an international body of knights reflected the wealth of the Angevin empire and augmented its prestige. The Young King\\'s leadership in the tournament projected a strong a vigorous image of Plantagenet rulership. Indeed, young Henry began a new trend by which English kingship took on a self-consciously chivalric dimension, and employed royal participation in the tournament as a crucial means of forging bonds between the king and his aristocracy: after a hiatus under John and Henry III, this would be developed by Edward I and reach its apogee with the enthusiastic tourneying of Edward III and the Black Prince. A very long quote, but Strickland\\'s summary is very apt and straightforward. For some context, Henry II\\'s sons, the Young King, Richard and Geoffrey, had rebelled against him in 1173-4 because he had not given them enough of their inheritance to satisfy their expectations. While Henry II did give Richard and Geoffrey more control over their respective territories of Aquitaine and Brittany, the Young King, it seems, had to make due with a larger tournament expenditure. But Henry II also saw the value of the friendships and reputation his heir would gain under the camaraderie of the tourney field. It\\'s quite similar to how we might go to a business networking event to build a social relationship with our colleagues. Henry the Young King had a successful tournament career but went on to die while fighting against his younger brother, Richard, in 1183. Only three years later, their brother Geoffrey, Duke of Brittany, died during a tournament in Paris. Some accounts say that he was trampled to death after falling from his horse, while other merely say that he fell ill, which has led modern historians to speculate that the tournament and/or Geoffrey\\'s cause of death were perhaps a fabrication to cover up the fact that he may have really been in Paris to conspire with Philip II against his father or brother, Richard. This demonstrates that while the tournament grounds could be the forge for friendships, they could also give conspirators an easy way of meeting without arousing suspicion. I could not find any indication of any policy changes towards tournaments following Geoffrey\\'s death, or anything specifically about Henry II\\'s response, which indicates that he may really have died of an illness. As Strickland states, this practice reaches it\\'s zenith with Edward III and his son, Edward the Black Prince (accurately depicted in A Knight\\'s Tale entering a tournament in disguise, though this behaviour is more commonly associated with his father). However, after the Black Prince and Edward III died, leaving the throne to Richard II, who was just a child, the practice declined. Richard II was deposed by Henry IV, whose son Henry V spent most of his time occupied with real warfare, which was passed to his infant son, Henry VI, whose reign was also filled with wars against his own family members. We do not really see the tournament in the same light in English history until the 16th Century, when the practice was revived by Henry VIII. This Henry is a good example of a son being barred from tournament participation, as he was the only son of Henry VII after the death of his brother, Arthur. Teenage Henry was only allowed to practice with a lance by catching rings with the lance instead of charging a live enemy. A major reason for this change was that the Tudor dynasty was young; Henry VII was the first ruler and had taken the throne by right of conquest. The Plantagenets who came before them had often had scores of relatives who might continue the dynasty should an heir die unexpectedly, but Henry VII, himself an only son, had no such security. Not to mention that the very mortality of Kings had been severely shaken throughout the 15th C as the Wars of the Roses saw two rival dynasties begin systematically killing each other off. It was no wonder Henry VII became paranoid that his line should continue, which he passed on to Henry VIII. Although... one of the first things that Henry VIII did after actually becoming King was fight in a real tournament. In summary, beginning with Henry II, it was considered a valuable prestige-builder to have your son become successful at tournaments. However, as the mortality of Kings was shaken and dynasties shrank, Kings became more protective of their sons. I hope this answers your question somewhat, though it is quite confined to English practices. There may be more examples from other European sources of father\\'s responses to their sons participating in tournaments. I would certainly be interest in Later Medieval French and Iberian examples if anyone would like to add to my answer.',\n",
       " \"The relationship between the two men was extensive and complex, going back a long way to before either of them became President. The two first met in 1947 when Nixon was a representative on the House Labour Committee and Reagan was President of the Screen Actors Guild. Reagan was still a Democrat at the time and it’s not like they became fast friends, but it did come only a few years before Nixon’s political rise from the House, to the Senate, to the Vice Presidency, and a few years prior to the start of Reagan’s conversion to the GOP. In what would be their last time on opposing sides of a campaign, Reagan supported fellow actor Helen Gahagan Douglas - Nixon’s opponent in the 1950 California Senate race – but in 1952 Reagan voted for the Eisenhower-Nixon ticket. Although I should note that this was probably more a vote for Eisenhower than Nixon. Reagan greatly admired Ike and was one of a group of Democrats who sent him a telegram urging him to run as a Democrat, only of course for him to ultimately throw his lot in with the Republicans. Reagan voted for him anyway. But in 1952, Reagan allegedly told a friend that Nixon “was less than honest and highly undeserving of the high honor paid him.” While Reagan shifted to the right in the 50s, he didn’t have much of a relationship with Nixon. According to his autobiography he “still carried around some bitter feelings from the 1950 Senate campaign.” Around the time Nixon was preparing to run in 1960, he says that a friend called Ralph Cordiner told him to reevaluate Nixon, and Reagan ended up deciding that the Vice President was “not the villain I’d thought him to be.” Reagan dates this reappraisal to 1960 in his book, but if he had disapproved of Nixon prior to then, that hadn’t stopped him from striking up a written correspondence with him in 1959. Starting in the summer, Reagan began - in the words of the Washington Post - “offering his comments on a variety of topics in a series of handwritten notes on his personal letterhead.” Here we can see the views Reagan would bring with him to the White House, writing on Sept. 7 that “communism or Marxism is the only systems with aggression advocated as an essential part of its dogma.” He continued on in that vein, saying that Nixon had spoken truth to the Soviet leadership and that “it was a truth seldom if ever uttered in diplomatic exchanges.” Nixon liked the letter so much that he had his staff draw up a special reply noting that what Reagan had written was “exactly on the beam.” During the 1960 campaign, Reagan was a “Democrat for Nixon,” although according to his autobiography he wanted to campaign for him as a Republican. Nixon apparently told him he’d be more effective as a Democrat. Nixon may have lost, but Reagan stuck with him and campaigned for the ex-Vice President during his failed 1962 campaign for California governor (this time as a Republican). Nixon’s ability to pick himself up from defeat was something Reagan admired, seeing as many saw the 1962 loss as the end of Nixon’s political career. Arguably so did he( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JA1edgj1U5E). Reagan continued to grow in conservative estimation, with his support for Barry Goldwater in 1964 and the “Time for Choosing” speech boosting his profile. He ran for California governor successfully in 1966 (beating Pat Brown, Nixon's opponent in 1962), and began eyeing the White House. He even tried to maneuver himself into the 1968 GOP nomination but Nixon was able to put a stop to that. Even so, Nixon recognized Reagan's talents, telling an aide that “He reaches the heart, we reach the head.” In any case Nixon easily clinched the nomination in August 1968, something which relieved Reagan in retrospect as he “wasn’t ready to be President.” Nixon’s views of Reagan were complex too. While recognizing his skills a communicator, Nixon felt that he lacked the killer instinct, saying in 1980 that he was “too nice to be President.” In 1968, he told the New York Times that he wouldn’t consider Reagan as a running mate because he was “a know-nothing in foreign policy. I’d never put him next in line for the Presidency.” It’s also worth noting that while Reagan had won in 1966 in California, Robert Finch, the candidate for Lieutenant Governor and a close Nixon ally, had gotten 10,000 more votes than Reagan. Nixon allegedly offered the VP nomination to Finch in 1968. One wonders how Reagan must have felt having “Nixon’s man” alongside him in Sacramento. Still, the two learned to co-exist. They had something of a falling-out over the 1971 Family Assistance Plan, which Reagan felt was too left-wing for a Republican welfare policy, although a compromise was eventually reached. Reagan did campaign for Nixon in 1968, but apparently not enough as Nixon apparently snubbed him at an inauguration ball. Still Nixon was happy enough with him to send him as a special envoy on trips to the Philippines in 1969, Taiwan, Japan in 1971, Western Europe in 1972, and Australia, Singapore, and Indonesia in 1973. Quite kind for someone who thought so little of Reagan’s foreign policy aptitude. Whatever their differences, Reagan stuck with Nixon through Watergate. When Nixon left the White House in disgrace on August 9 1974, Reagan stayed true and refused to join others in calling for Nixon’s indictment, saying that “The punishment of resignation…. certainly is more than adequate for the crime.” Jumping ahead a bit (past Reagan’s icy relationship with Gerald Ford), let’s look at Reagan in office. Reagan sought out Nixon’s views shortly after he won in 1980 and said he’d welcome his advice. Nixon sent him an 11 page memo making the case for Alexander Haig at State, William Casey at the CIA, and William French Smith at Justice, while also advising against the nomination of George Schultz for a cabinet job. Nixon also included some advice on general strategy, saying that Reagan should focus on economic and domestic affairs over foreign policy, arguing that Reagan should not travel abroad for this first 6 months. He recommended moving ahead with unpopular budget cuts in 1981, rather than waiting until later in the term. This economy-first line of thinking sat well with Reagan, and his staff came to realize that Nixon’s advice had been taken to heart. One aide said that “Nixon is telling us, don’t do as he did, do as he says.” Skipping ahead to post-inauguration, we have a good example of the working Nixon-Reagan relationship with the 1981 AWACS controversy. This centered on the Reagan administration’s intent to sell AWACS surveillance planes to Saudi Arabia. There was a lot of opposition to this, and to counter it, National Security Advisor Richard Allen contacted Nixon in late September or early October 1981 to try and get him to make a public declaration of support. Nixon obliged and wrote a supportive piece in the October 4 edition of the New York Times (cleared in advance with the White House). Allen was very pleased with it, writing to Reagan with the advance copy on October 3 This splendid piece will appear in tomorrow’s New York Times. It is exactly what we had hoped he would do. Nixon’s involvement continued. In 1982 he went on a 10th anniversary trip to China in recognition of his famous 1972 mission. He reported his experiences in detail to Reagan when he got back, providing the President with his views on the CCP leadership and how they detested the Soviets. This was valuable insight and Reagan of course made time to listen. Nixon had given Reagan foreign policy experience when he sent him abroad in the late 60s and early 70s, so Reagan listening to him on China creates a nice symmetry. Nixon would later brief Reagan prior to his trip to the People’s Republic in 1984. According to a brief entry on Nixon in the glossary of Reagan: A Life in Letters, the two kept up a correspondence until Tricky Dick died in 1994. It notes that Nixon sent Reagan memos over the course of his Presidency, which given even the brief examples I’ve given here, sounds about right, even if I can’t pull up a list for you. I can’t think Nixon would give up his apparently important place in the Reagan administration’s esteem. Still, Nixon retained his dim view of Reagan’s intellectual abilities. During the Iran and Contra scandals of 1986-87, Nixon said to GOP strategist John Sears that Reagan would survive the controversy “because when it is all said and done he can get up and say ‘I am an idiot and therefore cannot be blamed.’” Sears further recalled that Nixon added “I never had that option.” This has gone rather long and I’m sorry I’ve only included two examples from the actual Reagan administration. But seeing as they knew each other for so long prior to 1981, it seemed sensible to cover those years in a bit more depth, as it helps put the relationship in perspective. Sources to come. This has taken a long time to write so I’m going to have a coffee break first.\",\n",

He subsequently died after an illness in 1506, so he was dead for a few decades before the Spanish reached California and seven years before Francisco de Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Panama to site the Pacific Ocean and report back about the body of water that lay beyond the American landmass. Ferdinand Magellan, a few years later in 1519, led the first Spanish expedition to pass into the Pacific and then cross Oceania before his death. So Columbus sailed before the Spanish knew about California or the vast distance of the Pacific Ocean.',\n",
       " \"No. Even if there was anything like that, any high status figure in German society that escaped from German would've taken what they could with them. Also how the allied powers ended up using their Aerial capabilities, were to essentially render Germany a useless economic country, they focused on destroying factories most of the war or anything to disturb the German war effort. Eventually these bombings also turned to regular cities. You can Google what Dresden looked like before and after it was bombed on google. Also due to the nature of how Russia ran their army and how many deaths they received to their population during the war. Anything and Everything of value the Russian soldiers were sure to be taking it as plunder/payment for what Germany has done to them. So even if they had this stockpile, Germany was demolished after the war. That money would've easily been spent to rebuild cities, railways, ports, bridges even. Germany fell into economic collapse with lack of a workforce and infrastructure and needed the allies to support them with food and medicine, Its unknown how much support the Russian soldiers gave, but seeing how brutal they were in the mass rapes and plundering of German territory they controlled as well as how Stalin treated his own people, we can assume nothing. There was a moment when Stalin blocked supply transports from going through the Berlin Wall during early cold war confrontations. America had to resort to air drops to west Berlin to avoid starting a war with Russia. Finally too, Germany had to make reparation payments to allies for decades after the war. Google just said in October of 2010 Germany made its last world war 1 reparation payment. I haven't seen much on ww2 payments, but there could be still payments happening the public isn't aware of.\",\n",
       " 'I wouldn\\'t be so quick to jump from \"fairy tale of magically extended sleep\" to \"definitely describing a coma.\" We\\'re talking about a folk tale hidden inside the medieval equivalent of a fantasy novel here. And historical interpretation isn\\'t just about pointing to things we think we recognize from today--it\\'s about working from a medieval point of view and building up from there. Like, for example, knights who went to hell. But we’ll get there in a bit. \"Reading around\" fantasy can be an important way to look for details of daily life. My favorite example is in Quest del San Graal, where as soon as any of the knights get to a castle, the first thing they do is take off their armor. But that\\'s not what we\\'re talking about with the Sleeping Beauty variant in the medieval romance Perceforest. A fairy tale isn\\'t a \"myth to explain a scientific fact.\" In fact, Perceforest identifies the basic problem of long-term coma survival and says that they don\\'t know how to solve it. \"We don\\'t understand how she\\'s still alive, given that she\\'s not eating or drinking anything. So it must be a pagan goddess helping her.\" (Venus, if you\\'re wondering.) So...weeks and months, I\\'m not sure if there\\'s much to be said. For a handful of days, though? There\\'s definitely evidence for how medieval Christians, at least, perceived longer-than-a-regular-seizure-or-fainting unconsciousness, and their reactions. So now, our knight who went to hell. The Vision of Tundale is a 12C account of a knight who was “almost dead,” and was taken on a voyage through various parts of the afterlife. The point of the text is “be religious, not just moral, or guess where you’re going,” of course. But the frame story concerns us here, rather than recalcitrant cows and bridges made of spikes. Our Hero, Tundale, appeared to die, and before getting to the hell, purgatory, and heaven bits, the Visio sets the external scene: He then committed his axe to the care of his frien\\'s wife, saying, \"Take care of my axe, for I am dying.\" Then, as far as the word has any meaning, his body immediately sank to the ground, separated from his soul; and his spirit was no longer of any account there.\" The signs of death were present: his hair fell out, his forehead became hard, his eyes wandered, his nose became pointed, his lips grew pale, his mind failed, and his whole body grew rigid. The household ran, the food was removed, arms-bearers cried out, the guests cried, the body was laid out, the standards trembled, the clerk ran, the people marveled, and all the excited citizenry were disturbed by the death of this good soldier. Why do we die? From almost the tneth hour of the fourth day to the same hour on Saturday, he lay dead with no signs of life remaining in him, except that those who tried diligently to coax his body back to life felt a little heat on his left side. Because of this warmth that they felt in this small part of him, they did not wish to bury his body. So the first concern would be, is the comatose/whatever person actually dead, or just mostly dead? And since the verdict seems to be an ongoing case of “mostly dead,” they essentially hold a wake but delay the aftermath. However, it’s just a delay. After a week—warmth or not—they move to bury him. (Obviously this is when he wakes up.) So it’s interesting that the text, for this little bit, focuses so much on people’s emotional or ritualized responses, rather than on Tundale’s body. The author’s goal is to emphasize how he was perceived as essentially dead, so in this case, it’s a reasonable interpretation that said author is reflecting familiar rituals surrounding death. If you want gory descriptions of torments NOT in hell, we can talk about those, too. My main source base here—stories intended to make late medieval women look like a very particular type of saint—is...problematic, in terms of reading them as history, yes. But there’s still good reason to see some historical possibilities there. So, one of the go-to criteria for women’s sanctity in 14-16C Christian Europe was to fall into ecstasies frequently, especially after receiving the Eucharist (the all-important, absolutely VIP Christian ritual of the Middle Ages). In some earlier saints’ biographies, called hagiographies, the description is left as such. By 14C-15C, however, there was an emphasis on going into further detail and proof—very much in line with the general course of intellectual development. So the tl;dr here is that you have—in the context of these stories, remember—mostly men in a position of power enacting all sorts of bodily torment on ecstatic/non-present women to try to determine if they’re faking it. One of those times where it’s soooo tempting to do an anachronistic analysis… Why is this still potential evidence for coma/mostly dead management? First, because of its role in the stories—designed to make the reader believe the womanreally is “gone.” Second, because medieval cases of catatonia—where the person is able to eat, drink, etc but can’t communicate with words or gestures—were treated similarly, albeit with a very, very different motive and descriptions of methods that are not nearly as gruesome. So overall, it seems like medieval Christians perceived someone whose unconsciousness ranged well beyond sleep to be dancing between dead and mostly dead. They performed the rituals to take care of the person\\'s soul and their feelings and societal expectations. But there wasn\\'t much \"care\" of the body that could be taken besides watching over it and not burying it. But onlookers also seem to have made numerous attempts to wake up a person who \"slept\" too long--beautiful or not.',\n",
       " 'I can answer this from a historical ecology perspective, but mods let me know if this strays too far from Ask Historians. The short answer is yes, but slowly. In true biologist-boring-name fashion, this migration is known as \"Lessepsian\", after the modern canal’s designer, Ferdinand de Lesseps. The canal is about 160 km long, but not all of that was freshly dug. Steam engines, blasting, railroads, all the things that make canal building easy were still in their infancy, so much of the canal was dug by hand. This was expensive, deadly, and slow, so the canal was purposely routed through several existing salt lakes to reduce the length. Additionally, the canal has no locks. On the sections that were dug, depth was kept to a minimum, usually around 10 meters. Those are the two main barriers to migration through the canal. The center lakes were far too saline for most marine life, and the canal itself was an expanse of shallow, muddy, barren seabed. These problems have gradually been reduced over time; algae and plants have colonized the canal, the salinity has equaled out, and the canal itself has been greatly expanded over the years. In terms of what exactly migrates through, they are generally tropical Red Sea species moving to the Mediterranean and very rarely the other way around. The Red Sea is a much more biodiverse and ecologically energic environment, more heat, more food, more life. By contrast, the Mediterranean is colder and less competitive. It’s much easier for a highly competitive species to invade a less competitive environment than vice versa. The earliest species to cross the canal were likely plankton, free floating in the water, and hardy species like crustaceans which could tolerate the desolate environment. I’ve been perusing early British scientific journals to see if there’s any particularly early results for scientific observation of the invasive species. I’m finding scant secondhand reference to portunus pelagicus, a red sea crab and important commercial fish, being present in Port Said by 1898. Some species may also have traveled by boat hull. A flathead lobster, thennus orientalis, was first seen in Rijeka in Croatia in 1896. The work to consult on these early migrations appears to be Charles S. Elton’s “The Ecology of Invasions by Animals and Plants”, which is sadly out of print everywhere. There are several detailed reports from a Cambridge University expedition in 1924 which reveal an abundance of interlopers by then. More pragmatically, you can look at what fishermen now catch in the eastern Mediterranean. Penaeus japonicus, the japanese tiger prawn can be found in fishmarkets in the area. In modern days, the ecological impact of the canal is well studied on both commercial fisheries and on broader ecological trends. Red Sea species almost uniformly out-compete Mediterranean ones, and with the salinity in the canal dropping year over year and various further plans to expand the canal, it seems likely more migration is inevitable.',\n",
       " \"Throwing a sword is a sometimes-viable tactic. It has the obvious disadvantage of depriving the thrower of his/her sword, but it can be useful as a surprise move. One of the earliest surviving Medieval European fightbooks (martial arts manuals), Fiore de'i Liberi's manuscript from the early 15th century includes a brief note on throwing the longsword (AKA hand-and-a-half sword): https://wiktenauer.com/wiki/File:Pisani-Dossi_MS_17b-a.png For throwing I am well-prepared, On a big step I will make a bargain. My method is to throw my sword. Michael Hundt's rapier manual of 1611, Ein new Kůnstliches Fechtbuch im Rappier includes multiple throwing techniques. If one is getting too tired to continue, then throwing one's rapier, risky move though it is, can be better than continuing to fight conventionally: https://www.wiktenauer.com/wiki/File:Hundt_079.jpg ould your grace however be tired, so that you cannot continue, and especially when your life is in danger, then take your rappier back by the pommel and wind up with all your might, and throw it at the group, and look around for another good advantage, or with it, take refuge to the preservation of life and limb, when you can do nothing else, and you would rather live than be dead. Throwing one's rapier at a group of attackers can win enough time to escape: https://www.wiktenauer.com/wiki/File:Hundt_094.jpg However, if your grace will be assaulted on the way home, by a whole group of enemies, then take your rappier with both fists and shoot it at the whole group, and see hereafter where your grace can gain further protection, because need sometimes breaks iron, ere you live, there you give. A less risky throwing technique, with a dagger, is to throw the dagger and keep your rapier: https://www.wiktenauer.com/wiki/File:Hundt_093.jpg If your grace wants to deceive one with dagger and rappier, and the other also has a dagger in his left hand, and he throws it at your grace, then see that you also use on him the Meisterstücke, and throw yours against him, then it comes from time to time, that you both are brawling together, and can neither of you do anything in rappier and dagger, but rather from fear must you need it, and as soon as your loss nor your benefit: One behalf of which is my advice, it is provided for with dagger and rappier, then with the throwing you can take a great big opponent, when one does it, that you want to cast at them, and this technique has much in itself. While this is done with a dagger, note that these are long daggers, and the same can be done with a short sword, if one using a pair of swords, either long and short (like a katana and wakizashi) or two short swords (or even two long swords, which is a rare but occasional combination). Throwing the dagger also appears in Antonio Quintino's book of fighting tricks: If by chance you find yourself armed with the sword and dagger, and you came against your enemy, put your hands to the one and the other, but stick the sword that you have drawn under your left arm, as you see in the present figure, and next the dagger in your right hand, and throw it forcefully toward the face of your enemy, which being done, take with speed the sword previously resting under your left arm, and with that molest your enemy, because against the attack of the dagger, it is not to be at all doubted, he will procure himself some defense in that tempo, either with retreating, or raising his arm, or making some other sign to ward the said blow, in which tempo you, delivering mandritti and riversi, will safely strike him. However it would be good to accustom yourself to throwing the dagger well with the point, in order to enable it to hit; but even if you do not know how to do thus well, do not for this reason refrain from doing the aforesaid blow, because wherever the dagger goes, you place the adversary in such disorder, that you, being quick to strike with your sword, will remain the victor. Interestingly, he notes that while it is useful to be skilled enough to hit with the point of the dagger, a forceful throw can still provide an excellent distraction. One tactical use is to use throwing your sword to distract a spear-wielding opponent enough to enable you to close, at which point you would then draw and use your dagger/knife, or wrestle.\",\n",

       " \"I don't think a huge amount of context is needed really: the main bits of knowledge that the Iliad takes for granted are there's a war going on; the Trojans and their allies are based in the city, the Greeks have a camp by the sea; some of the main characters. The last item is the one that causes the most problems, because the names do pile up in places, and it can be disorienting if you don't know which ones to pay attention to. The opening book has several characters that seem like they're going to be regulars, but they turn out to be bit parts. That kind of thing. So an edition with a glossary of names at the back would be a good call. Just briefly, the characters you need to pay attention to are -- Greeks: Achilles, Patroclus, Agamemnon, Menelaus, Diomedes, Nestor, Odysseus, Aias In Troy: Hector, Paris/Alexandros, Helen, Priam, Sarpedon, Aeneas Neutral-ish gods: Zeus, Thetis Gods allied to Troy: Apollo, Aphrodite, Ares Gods allied to the Greeks: Athena, Hera, Poseidon If you can digest this, you may not even need a glossary of names. Most modern editions are fine. Caroline Alexander's translation is a notable one from the last ten years, and she's got a poetic style, but it sounds rather biblical and the notes aren't as extensive as some others. Stanley Lombardo's translation has the best track record among new readers. Also popular are the ones by Robert Fagles and Robert Fitzgerald. I have a personal fondness for Rodney Merrill's. All of these would be fine. I do however have some recommendations on ones that you should avoid. Richmond Lattimore. His version is excellent, and it's been a standby in college courses for generations. Lattimore does have a fine literary quality. The problem is just that it's too damn hard. It feels contorted. Stephen Mitchell. His version leaves out most of the epithets (the things that actually give Homer his flavour), and he leaves out book 10. Regardless of the reasoning, book 10 is part of the Iliad as the ancient Greeks knew it: it's irresponsible to pretend it doesn't exist. Old translations. They're not necessary bad or wrong -- well, not all of them -- it's just that I'd recommend a 21st century reader go with a version designed for a modern audience. This includes: A. T. Murray, Samuel Butler, Alexander Pope, E. V. Rieu, and many more. Note that Rieu's version is still available in a Penguin edition, and it's almost completely flavourless. Murray and Butler are widely reprinted and available online, because they're out of copyright, and I think they're both awful. Overall I'd say go for Stanley Lombardo. It's a clean read, it's got excellent notes and guidance, and it's very popular. As a back-up I suggest Robert Fagles. --- A quick comparison of some of the translations I've mentioned, using a passage from book 19 where Achilles receives new arms forged by the gods. (This is the same passage that was used for comparison in a review of Peter Green's translation, which isn't one of the ones I'm recommending.)

But Achilles, When he saw it, felt his rage seep Deeper into his bones, and his lids narrowed And lowered over eyes that glared Like a white-hot steel flame. Robert Fagles: A tremor ran through all the Myrmidon ranks -- none dared to look straight at the glare, each fighter shrank away. Not Achilles. The more he gazed, the deeper his anger went, his eyes flashing under his eyelids, fierce as fire -- Robert Fitzgerald: Myrmidons began to tremble at the sound, and dared not look straight at the armor; their knees shook. But anger entered Akhilleus as he gazed, his eyes grown wide and bright as blazing fire, ... Caroline Alexander: And trembling took all the Myrmidons, nor did any dare to look upon it straight, and they shrank afraid; but Achilles as he gazed upon it, so anger entered him all the more, and his eyes terribly shone out beneath his lids like fire flare ...\",\n",
       " \"I'm afraid I can't speak to exactly why there was a change in Academy Award ceremony dates and eligibility periods, but it's worth pointing out something that you haven't mentioned in your question which I think you might have missed: although there was no ceremony held in 1933, that doesn't mean there was a period (either in 1933 or 1932) where no films released were considered for awards. The 5th Academy Awards ceremony (the one held in 1932) was, like the previous two ceremonies, held in November, and it honoured films released in the 12 months between August 1931 and July 1932. People familiar with the modern Oscars might find this surprising, as everyone knows that nowadays, each award ceremony relates to a single calendar year of film releases (i.e. the 92nd Academy Awards ceremony, held in February 2020, honoured films released in 2019). The 7th Awards was when this started, and the 6th - the one you're asking about - covered the transition period Perhaps the Academy in the early-'30s thought that it would make more sense (i.e. be better for marketing) for each ceremony to relate to a single year's worth of film releases, or perhaps there was another reason the ceremony had to be pushed back, but either way, the 6th Academy Award ceremony was held in March 1934, and honoured films released in the 17 months from August 1932 to the end of December 1933. This meant that no films released in late 1932 (and therefore ineligible for the 5th Awards) were overlooked, and that in future, each ceremony could cover 12 months of releases from a single year. Hopefully, someone else can chip in with more detail about the Academy's actual decision making process.\",\n",

       " \"The Russians were quite interested in the events of the crusade. They weren’t too interested in the specific doctrinal differences between the Greek and Roman churches, but they knew it had something to do with the other crusades that targeted Jerusalem. The crusades in general are mentioned relatively rarely in Russian sources. They were aware of the First Crusade and happily reported when Jerusalem was conquered in 1099. Russians must have already been going on pilgrimage to Jerusalem long before the crusades, as did Christians from elsewhere in Europe, and this tradition continued under the crusaders - in fact one of the earliest pilgrimage accounts of the crusader kingdom is from a Russian monk, Daniel of Kiev. Constantinople was much closer to home though, and was the spiritual capital of their own church. There was no division between the Greek and Russian Orthodox churches yet. Russia had been converted by Greek missionaries from Constantinople and the various Russian states remained closely linked with the Greek church and the empire. One Russian chronicle, the “Chronicle of Novgorod”, is pretty well-informed and includes several pages about the events of the crusade. It mentions how Emperor Isaac II (Isak) was overthrown, blinded, and imprisoned by his brother, Alexios III (Oleksa), and how Isaac’s son, also named Alexios (Oleksa Isakovits), escaped from Constantinople and met with the German “tsar” Philip of Swabia. Philip and the Pope then organized a military expedition to restore Isaac to the throne. “But the Franks i.e. Latin Europeans and all their Voyevodas conceived lust for the gold and silver, which Isakovits promised them, and forgot the commands of Tsar and Pope.” (Chronicle of Novgorod, pg. 44) There’s an abbreviated account of the siege - the crusaders attacked and there was a fire in the city; Alexios III abdicated and restored Isaac; Isaac was then overthrown again by his son who became Alexios IV; but the people of Constantinople rejected Alexios IV and he was overthrown by yet another Alexios, Alexios V Mourtzouphlos (Murchufl). The crusaders were waiting for Alexios IV to reward them for their help, but clearly that wasn’t going to happen now, so they attacked Constantinople again and took it in April 1204. “And so perished the empire of the God-protected Kostyantingrad and the Greek land in the quarrel of Tsars; and the Franks rule it.” (Chronicle of Novgorod, pg. 48) The chronicle knows the main leaders of the crusade, although by their titles rather than by name: “Markos”, i.e. Boniface, the marquess of Montferrat; “Kondoflandr”, or Baldwin, the count of Flanders; and “Duzh”, or Enrico Dandolo, the doge of Venice. The Russians know all about Dandolo’s blindness and the story that he was blinded on purpose by the emperor Manuel. All of this information must have come from an eyewitness - the chronicle goes into great detail about the treasures that the crusaders plundered from Hagia Sophia, so perhaps it was a Russian priest or monk, or maybe a Russian member of the Varangian Guard, who were expelled after the conquest. However, judging from the focus on the German involvement in Alexios’ scheme, the source may also have been German. The Russian reaction seems to agree with certain Greek sources (like Nicetas Choniates) and Western European sources, that the arrogance of the Greeks was to blame. The Greeks probably could have defeated the crusade but they were more interested in petty infighting. Otherwise the Russians don't seem to have been very concerned at all; at least the city was still in Christian hands. “It seemed almost a matter of indifference whether Constantinople was in the hands of the Greeks or the Franks. The Russians still remained aloof from the religious rivalry of Constantinople and Rome. The value of the Novgorod chronicle is its neutrality.” (Angold, pg. 11) Sources: The Chronicle of Novgorod, 1016-1471, trans.

       " 'It was reported the Iraq imported about 4000 PS2s. The original report appears to the WND article: https://www.wnd.com/2000/12/7640/ supposedly based on information leaked by US intelligence. While it was reported that clusters of 12-15 PS2s would provide enough computing power to control a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle), there\\'s no evidence that this was actually done. Earlier in 2000, Japan had placed export controls on the PS2 because they had militarily-useful computing power, specifically because they provided enough grunt to be useful for image analysis, in turn useful for guiding missiles or bombs using camera images: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/716237.stm Sony applied for permission to export the PS2, and got it, except for export to Iran, Iraq, Libya and North Korea. The 4000 Iraqi PS2s would have been re-exported from another country (if they actually existed). The PS2 (and the PS3) could be, and were, used to build supercomputer clusters. These consoles provide plenty of computing power, at a low price. The profit margins on the consoles themselves were not high - Sony would make their money from games for them. With different manufacturers competing in the game console market, keeping the price low was important. The cheaper the console, the more buyers there would be, and there would be more buyers for the games. Notably, the cost of developing a game is independent of the number of copies of the game that are sold, and the per-copy cost of producing the game is very low. Once the development cost is covered, it\\'s almost all profit. The result: the PS2 provided very cost-effective computing power. This made them attractive for home-built supercomputer clusters for scientists who wanted to stretch their limited grant money as far as it would go. The first high-profile PS2 supercomputer cluster, using 70 PS2 consoles, was built by the US National Centre for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, in 2003. This was facilitated by Sony\\'s Linux kit for the PS2, Linux for PlayStation 2 (or PS2 Linux), which was a Linux developer\\'s kit and provided simple access for the use of the PS2\\'s GPUs (graphics processing units) for general-purpose computing: https://web.archive.org/web/20041120084657/http://arrakis.ncsa.uiuc.edu/ps2/ http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/news/story/playing_the_supercomputer_game Similarly, the PS3 was used to build supercomputer clusters, with a small 16-console cluster put together by an astrophysics group at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth in 2007: https://www.actapress.com/Abstract.aspx?paperId=35723 This inspired the US Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) to build a larger cluster in 2010, using 1760 PS3 consoles: https://phys.org/news/2010-12-air-playstation-3s-supercomputer.html This was, at the time, the 33rd most powerful supercomputer in the world, and built for about 1/10 the cost typical of similarly powerful systems. They generously thanked the Dartmouth group by donating additional PS3s, allowing their cluster to be extended to 176 consoles. https://www.umassd.edu/feature-stories/2014/ps3-supercomputer-cryptography-contest.html and eventually, over 400 consoles: https://web.uri.edu/gravity/ps3/ The PS2/PS3 supercomputer market basically crashed in 2010 when Sony disabled the ability of these consoles to run other operating systems (such as Linux). The \"cheap supercomputer\" effort had already begun shifting to the use of conventional PCs using high-performance graphics cards for parallel computing, and this continues to the be the cheap-hardware approach to supercomputing. Without the 2002 Linux kit, Iraq would have faced a difficult project to turn their PS2s into a useful supercomputer. More likely, their intent was simply to use them as stand-alone PCs (which they couldn\\'t import due to sanctions). Earlier in 2000, Sony had announced that the PS2 could run Linux, allowing it to be used as a general purpose computer, although with much more effort required from the user to do so than with their still-to-come 2002 Linux kit.',\n",
       " 'Where does that quote come from? I know of two French pensions, only one that I was aware of dealt with Henry VIII, one that deals with an Edward. Context for both goes back to when Isabella of France married Edward II of England. Her brother, the French king, died without issue and by English law Isabella and her descendants should be the next heirs. But French didn\\'t recognize matrilineal claims, so in French law, essentially the next closest male relative should be heir. Edward III by virtue of his mother Isabella felt entitled to the French crown, and this was a major factor in the start of the 100 Years War between France and England. Later Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt also won a promise of the French throne but died before he could inherit. English royalty felt slighted twice over for their \\'rightful\\' inheritance. The on-and-off battles of England and France, and side-parties like the Dukes of Burgundy and Brittany meant that pieces of territory were fought over. Fast forward to Edward IV, of the War of the Roses, he tried to invade France with the Dukes of Burgundy and Brittany as allies. That didn\\'t go well and King Louis of France said he\\'d be a better ally and managed to talk Edward down despite at having given safety to \\'traitors\\' to Edward at different points. Louis essentially said, \\'hey, you and I can be great allies, I\\'ll pay you a bunch of money, I\\'m more reliable than the goobs you teamed up with. Also if either of us has rebellions we help each other out. Just leave France and the French throne alone, how about it?\" And from that alliance, the Treaty of Picquigny was made which granted Edward IV a yearly pension from the French crown. I\\'ve never heard that it carried on after Edward/Louis death, which doesn\\'t mean it didn\\'t, but I\\'ve not come across that. That\\'s the Edward with a pension I\\'m aware of. As for Henry VIII, in the Treaty of More, Wolsey negotiated a settlement with the French. England agreed to relinquish some territories that either they held them, or believed they should hold them in exchange for a French pension. There were little caveats added but that was essentially it, it was another paying off of England with some alliance and financial settlements attached.',\n",
       " 'Greetings! I shall attempt to give an overview of the various historiographical reasons why America was so helpful to the British and French before 1917, and why \"straight up declaring war on the Germans\" was not as easy an option as it sounds. Do note however, that I am unable to respond on that whole \"sending submarines through Canada\" point, as my research has not yielded that specific nugget of information. Perhaps contacting the Great War series\\' editors and asking for their sources might be a good idea if it remains a topic of interests. Until then, let\\'s begin. When war was declared in 1914, America followed its foreign policy of \"isolationism\", in which it generally frowned upon and refused to take part in European affairs, especially if those affairs involved a conflict. This war seemed to be no different at the outset, and as a result the American public was overwhelmingly in support of neutrality. President Woodrow Wilson was not exactly passive in this regard either (that is, he did not simply declare US neutrality and leave it at that). He monitored the war as it unfolded \"across the pond\", and in 1916 his personal emissary Colonel Edward House attempted to explore the possibility of an Allied-German peace settlement, with America mediating the two sides. This of course, was not possible in a year which had seen so many (at least superficial) German victories on both the Western and Eastern Fronts, and would not satisfy the Anglo-French terms of peace either. The American public itself was also divided by 1916. Whilst Wilson believed that \"British navalism\" was just as bad as \"German militarism\", there were two clear sides forming (albeit minority sides, as neutrality remained the major sentiment up until 1917). On the one hand, America was full of ethnic German-Americans, whose vote Wilson may have wished to secure by promising neutrality in the coming years. There were also Irish voters in the Eastern cities, whose fury at the British oppression during the 1916 Easter Uprising meant they were against the US joining an old enemy. On the other hand, the Pro-British side was formed of the \\'Wasp\" (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant, as Michael Howard terms it) supremacy on the east coast, as well as notable figures such as newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst and ex-President Theodore Roosevelt. Neither side could claim the majority up until 1917, so America had to remain politically neutral in the whole affair. Economically however, America was most certainly not neutral, though this was mostly due to wartime fact rather than commercial preference. France and Britain relied to a considerable extent on shipments of American goods to sustain the war effort, and the US was more than willing to extend credit to these countries and continue the flow of materiel. On the other hand, the Royal Navy\\'s blockade of Germany meant that no US goods were able to flow into that country. This of course created a natural \"tilt\" towards the Entente Powers, and gave the traders in America more to worry about as the war dragged on. Michael Howard sums up this economical perspective well: \"Yet as the war went on an increasing amount of that business America getting involved in war consisted in supplying war material to the Allies - not necessarily out of ideological sympathy, but because they could not get it to the Germans. If that trade were interrupted, then the war would become their business, whether they like it or not.\" This fear of interrupted trade had been realised in 1915 when the Lusitania sank with 128 American lives onboard. Though she had been carrying ammunition in a secret hold compartment, the Germans were forced to scale down their submarine offensives in the Atlantic and operate by \"cruiser warfare rules\", by which all passengers had to be warned of an attack, allowed to abandon ship, and pointed in the direction of the nearest port (idealistic at best, downright impossible and impractical at worst). In 1917 however, all this changed. With the removal of Russia from the war, the American public began to realise that of the two sides in Europe, there was a lesser evil. They had seen propaganda posters and news reports of the horrific German atrocities in Belgium, the use of poison gas, and the POW camps. The LIFE magazine (a satirical one, not the one we have today) even circulated a cover in 1917 of a picture of the American states \"if Germany won the war\". Fascinating image by the way, worth a look and analysis here So clearly in 1916-17 we have a clear lean of sympathies towards the Entente and the Anglo-French nations, but how did this translate to American involvement? It all came to a climax in the Spring of 1917. We of course have the Zimmerman telegram which was published in the American press and read like a declaration of war (despite the fact it was anything but). We also have the German decision, after much internal and external discussion, to resume unrestricted submarine warfare. Once these two events had occurred, the fuse was lit. It was only a matter of Wilson deciding to declare war, which he very reluctantly did on April 5, 1917. So, to sum up the critical points to this question: Why was there such an effort to help the British? And why was it done in such secrecy when they could have just straight up declared war on the Germans? The effort to help the British and French started off as a purely economical one, and that was in of itself a practical rather than ideological preference for trade (remember the RN blockade of Germany). America could not declare war without risking internal divisions and a serious political break from the previous decades of \"anti-European involvement\". It was in 1917 when a major growth of public support for the British, condemnation of the Germans (especially after the Zimmerman Telegram) , and the resumption of submarine warfare that pressured Wilson to go to war.

       " \"/u/Starwarsnerd222's answer is excellent, but I would like to tag on in regards to the submarines you had mentioned. The United States government did not build submarines for the United Kingdom at that point. However, there was in fact a deal involving the Electric Boat Company (based in Groton, Connecticut), the Fore River Shipyard (in Quincy, Massachusetts), the Bethlehem Steel Corporation (Bethlehem, Pennsylvania) and the United Kingdom to build 20 H Class submarines based off of an Electric Boat design. 10 would eventually be built in the United States, and the other 10 would be built in Canada. During this time period the United States Government did not operate its own shipyards for submarines or design its own submarines (the Navy would start designing its own submarines in 1915 and 1916). Rather, it put out contracts which specified design features that they wished to see in a class of submarines, and the price they expected to pay for the class. The two submarine design firms in the United States at the time were Electric Boat Company which was based in Groton, Connecticut and formed originally by Isaac Rice to build submarines designed by John Holland and the other was the Lake Torpedo Boat Company which was based in Bridgeport, Connecticut and founded by Simon Lake. These two firms would respond to these contracts with counter-offers, often with a more expensive price-tag and without all of the features that the U.S. Government wanted.^1 But, as the U.S. Government at this time did not the capacity to build its own submarines, they could only acquiesce to the firms. So in the United States you have two independent submarine designers who are not part of the government and were not exclusively designing and selling submarines to the United States. They sold their designs and submarines around the globe. For example, In 1914, after the success of German submarine U-9 in sinking the HMS Hawke (U-9 had earlier sunk the cruisers Aboukir, Cressy, and Hogue), Simon Lake had this to say about the German designs:^2 The result was that I made an agreement with Krupps who were to build my type in Russia and Germany. I placed in the German hands my plans, copies of patents and technical data. The German submarines in principle are practically duplicates of the Lake type in regard to submarine torpedo characteristics. Now, the interview as a whole does have to be read, at least a little bit, as Lake attempting to sell the world on the military effectiveness of his boats. But, Lake did in fact have a deal with the Krupp firm to build his submarines which was in the words of one biographer “very lucrative”. Lake would receive a consulting fee from Krupp, and the Lake Torpedo Boat Company would receive 12 ½% royalties on Krupp built submarines for Russia, 7 ½% royalties on Krupp built submarines for Italy, and 6% royalties for Krupp built submarines for Germany.^3 This brings us to the United Kingdom. Similarly, Electric Boat had sold rights and designs for Holland designed boats to Vickers and Maxim to build them in the United Kingdom and the British Empire. In November 1914 an order for submarines was placed at the Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts through the Bethlehem Steel Corporation out of Pennsylvania. This initial order in November, 1914 was for 20 submarines, although they would not be completed in the United States, rather they would be shipped in parts to be assembled elsewhere, mainly Canada. These would use the British H class designs, which were originally a design from Electric Boat. By December, Charles M. Scwhab, who ran the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, was being questioned by the Secretary of States William Jennings Bryan who pressured Schwab into cancelling the submarine orders.^4 It’s not entirely fair to say that Schwab “cancelled” the orders, rather ten of the submarines had all construction shifted to Canada to a Vickers & Maxim shipyard (they had not begun construction in the U.S. yet), while the other ten were launched but interned by the U.S. Government until the U.S. joined the war. A number of them would be sold to Chile by the UK as a payment for their seizure of unfinished ships originally intended for Chile. So in the case of these submarines, it wasn’t the United States government who sold them to the United Kingdom. The Government was actually against such a deal. Rather, it was private companies and shipyards who had worked out contracts worth upwards of $10,000,000. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 1: Gary E.

       " \"First of all, we should keep one premise in advance in mind that the establishment of the town, or even the seasonal market place (called emporium in Latin) itself was a new historical phenomenon in Viking Age Scandinavia. Many local magnates as well as commoners still lived in rural countryside at that time. I have heard that the chief lives in the great hall, is this true? What you've heard is essentially true, but the majority of the excavated ground plan of the great hall has been located in the rural area (see above). The locationally adjoining pairing of 'royal residence/ estate' and 'market place', such as Hovgården in Adelsö in the Lake Mälaren, Sweden and nearby Birka (international town), has been confirmed across Scandinavian world. In short, the chieftain who held the control over the town generally lived in the great hall near the town, but did not necessarily have a great hall in the town itself. The average length of such an excavated great hall varies from ca. 25 meters to 40 meters long, but the largest one found so far in Borg, Lofoten Island, Northern Norway, dated to the 10th century indeed extended ca. 83 meters long and 700 square meter floor space. And second, would the stave church double as a great hall? Or was it too sacred? Your question is actually very good but difficult to offer an definitive answer, since the opinion of researchers still vary. In the 1960s and 1970s, the majority of scholars agreed that the great hall also fulfilled a function of the place of cultic activity, such as a seasonal sacrifice and feast (I suppose this hypothesis was still valid in some sites), but mainly since the end of the 20th century, we've found a series of the sites/ ground plan of seemingly dedicated cult building from Viking Age (or even possibly prior to that period) Scandinavia, such as Tissø in Western Sjælland, Denmark and Uppåkra in Skåne, Southern Sweden (Larsson 2007). It is not so easy to re-construct the visual and structure of the entire building almost only based on the ground plan, however, and I personally feel that many of such reconstructions resembles medieval Stave church too much. You can see (a bit dated) 3d-reconstruction of the hall and the distinct cultic building found in Tissø, made by the National Museum of Denmark, here on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BekBcZOiqQE Some early churches, such as St. Clement in Trondheim, Norway (1st half of the 11th century (linked to the English presentation of the excavation, including the ground plan plot) has also recently been excavated, but they does not necessarily follow the pattern of extant stave church, though they share the most basic trait in common (made mainly of timber).

       " \"My, that's a rosy picture! The Korean People's Association in Manchuria (KPAM) was more the territory of Kim Chwa-chin. (It was also called the Korean People's Autonomous Zone and a bunch of other names. I'm sticking with KPAM purely for convenience.) Kim Chwa-chin is a fascinating figure in his own right. He was born the son of an important nobleman, married the daughter of a prominent noble family, and went on to have a military career before becoming a mob boss and eventually a revolutionary. He managed to straddle the line between the Nationalist and Communist resistances to Japan. Both North Korea and South Korea have statues of him. His hometown (in the South) has a museum and the North includes him in museums of revolutionary heroes. Kim was invited to the Soviet Union along with other prominent Korean Communists in 1920. He refused, instead remaining in Manchuria to fight directly. Kim was one of the best generals the Korean revolutionaries had. He set himself up as a minor warlord in the Chinese civil war, operating mostly in parts of Manchuria with a large Korean population. He also used his mob connections to make money to fund his army and acquire weapons. Kim had gained control of most of Shinmin by 1925, partly because of local politics involving Zhang Zuolin. Shinmin remained under his forces control from 1925 to 1931. Kim implemented various Communist and anarchist policies and proclaimed the KPAM in 1929. But the reality was that Kim retained control of the military. He, and a clique of officers, retained real power. Kim was both the supreme commander and the chairman of the region. The KPAM was mostly a way to create limited self-governance under the framework of Kim's rule. When Kim was assassinated, his subordinate officers immediately began to fight each other for control. Under pressure from other forces, many of them simply abandoned the region. By 1931 the KPAM had been eliminated. Kim's family fled back to Korea, where they went back into the revolutionary/mob business. His son, Kim Du-han, led a gang in Seoul and ultimately sided with the Korean nationalists. He became an important politician in South Korea. His daughter (Kim Chwa-chin's granddaughter) is a mid-level Korean politician, important in one of the smaller parties. If you want to read up on it, read up on Kim Chwa-chin. It wasn't so much an independent state or a revolutionary uprising as Kim imposing his ideology on a region he conquered. The biography put out by Hanseong is a pretty good overview. There are other biographies floating around too. You can also read up on Korean revolutionary history, he pops up a lot in the 1920s. And, in a less historical sense, The Age of Wild Men is a Korean drama that follows the life of his son, including their time in the KPAM. He's something of a cultural figure and that's not the only work that features him, just the most famous. PS: Despite the name, Kim had no family relation to the Kims that now rule North Korea. Kim is an extremely common Korean surname. He did know Kim Il-sung personally, though.\",\n",
       " 'If you\\'re interested in a discussion of why and how the Soviets treated countries in Eastern Europe the way they did in the 1940s, you might want to see this answer I wrote. I linked specifically to the conversation around Greece. The long and short is that by agreement with Britain (the so called \"Percentages\" or \"Naughty\" Agreement) in October 1944, Greece was to be predominantly in a British rather than Soviet sphere of influence. At the time, the two major resistance movements in Greece were EDES (the National Republican Greek League) and the Greek Communist-led EAM-ELAS (National Liberation Front - Greek People\\'s Liberation Army). By the time when German occupying forces were withdrawing from Greece in October 1944, these two groups were in a low-level civil war with each other. The British army, by agreement, entered the country that month and re-installed the Greek government in exile led by George Papandreou. EAM-ELAS participated, along with other resistance groups in a government of national unity, but when the British commander Ronald Scobie ordered the disarmament of ELAS, its government ministers resigned, and ELAS supporters staged demonstrations in Athens, which were fired upon by the police. The clashes escalated until the British army was itself engaged against ELAS, with a ceasefire agreement finally reached on January 11, whereby ELAS was disarmed. Its communist elements would reorganize and launch a second armed campaign in 1946, which depending on how you count things either was the start of the Greek Civil War proper, or the start of the third phase of an ongoing Civil War. The Soviets largely respected the British militarily enforcing their sphere of influence, and most logistical and material support for the Greek Communists came from Yugoslavia, rather than the Soviets. The British continued to support the Greek government until March 1947, when the US began to provide substantial aid to the government. The Soviet-Yugoslavian split in 1948 weakened the Greek Communists as it meant the Yugoslavs withheld material support (fearing and preparing for a Soviet invasion) while Albania and Bulgaria (still in the Soviet camp) limited their support for the movement, and the war was effectively over by 1949.',\n",
       " 'The description of descent here has nothing to do with north and south, but the flow of the Nile river. (Indeed, it\\'s not really clear to what extent ancient authors thought about the world with a northward orientation, but I digress.) Ethiopia is above Egypt because following the Nile it is upriver of Egypt. This is also why, even today, upper Egypt is south of lower Egypt. (We find the same logic elsewhere, for example Upper Canada is to the south of Lower Canada, since the St Lawrence has an at least partially north-ward route.) This is made entirely clear, for example, in Strabo\\'s Geography. The geography of Egypt and Ethiopia, in book 17, is centred around the geography of the Nile: Since, in my description of Arabia, I have also included the gulfs which pinch it and make it a peninsula, I mean the Persian and Arabian Gulfs, and at the same time have gone the rounds of certain parts both of Aegypt and of Aethiopia, I mean the countries of the Troglodytes and the peoples situated in order thereafter as far as the Cinnamon-bearing country, I must now set forth the remaining parts that are continuous with these tribes, that is, the parts in the neighbourhood of the Nile... (17.1.1) And, of course, conceptually the geographical description follows the direction of the river, which of course flows from south to north: The Nile flows from the Aethiopian boundaries towards the north in a straight line to the district called \"Delta\"... (17.1.4) This grounds the logic of up and down in these descriptions, hence for example when describing the Island of Meroë, Strabo notes explicitly that above refers to the south: It is bounded on the Libyan side by large sand-dunes, and on the Arabian side by continuous precipices, and above, on the south, by the confluence of the three rivers — the Astaboras, and the Astapus and the Astasobas and on the north by the next course of the Nile, which extends to Aegypt along the aforesaid windings of the river. (17.2.2) That this logic of ascending refers to the Nile, not the cardinal points, is made totally explicit in an earlier reference to Menelaus travelling up the nile: Everybody who tells the story of his own travels is a braggart; to this class belonged Menelaus, who had ascended the Nile as far as Ethiopia (1.2.23) This is also clear in Herodotus\\'s description of Egypt: For even though a man has not before been told it he can at once see, if he have sense, that that Egypt to which the Greeks sail is land acquired by the Egyptians, given them by the river — not only the lower country but even all the land to three days\\' voyage above the aforesaid lake i.e. Moeris, which is of the same nature as the other, though the priests added not this to what he said.

       " 'This is a great question! It is very unlikely that the events in Josephus\\' account occurred as described, as such an action would seem out of character and ill advised. However, Cleopatra\\'s interactions with the Jews in Alexandria and Judea were complicated. Before getting into it, it is very important to talk about the source of the claim: Josephus. Josephus is a deeply problematic source for a number of reasons, including his political and ideological bias, and because of the sources he used. It is believed that Josephus\\' account of Cleopatra derives from two main sources, Nicolaus of Damascus and Herod the Great\\'s autobiography. Both of them knew Cleopatra personally, but they also had adopted a negative stance towards her by the time they wrote their memoirs. Josephus wrote Against Apion to defend the Jewish community in Alexandria against a polemical attack by the Egyptian grammarian Apion. The context in which Josephus claims that Cleopatra denied famine relief to the Jews is in a work which entreaties sympathy from his Roman audience, claiming that she had broken with the Ptolemaic tradition of friendliness towards the Jews in Egypt, and Augustus had rescued them from her. He appeals heavily to Roman sentiments and sensibilities, including the idea that Cleopatra was a cruel and rapacious tyrant who coveted the lands belonging to Herod the Great. Josephus goes so far as to claim that, as Augustus captured Alexandria, Cleopatra believed that her kingdom could be saved if she managed to kill every Jew in the city, if need be with her bare hands. This is not repeated in any other source, and can be dismissed as absurd. #1/2: Cleopatra\\'s relationship to the Jews in Alexandria & Egypt Most historians find it implausible that Cleopatra would deny food relief to the Jewish community in Alexandria. For one thing, Jews were one of the three largest ethnic groups in Alexandria, after Greeks and Egyptians, and had their own quarter of the city. In ancient Egypt, as elsewhere throughout history, a lack of food led to an angry and desperate populace. Withholding food from one group of her subjects while providing to others would have been potentially disastrous. Alexandria in particular was a powder keg, since dynastic struggles, ethnic tensions, and economic pressures threatened to kick off riots at every turn. Cleopatra knew well to respect the power of the mob, since many members of her own family had been deposed or even torn apart for displeasing them. This occurred more than once when the line of succession was disputed, or when hostilities between ethnic groups reached a boiling point. Had she made such a decision, it would almost certainly have been mentioned in other sources. The only reason given by Josephus to explain this is that she had some personal animosity towards the Jews, but evidence from her reign indicates the opposite. Cleopatra\\'s personal policy towards religion was to protect the sanctuaries and rights of various groups - including some Jewish communities - in the hopes that their support would strengthen her rule. A decree granting inviolability to a synagogue in Leontopolis has survived, indicating that she followed the example of her forebears who officially recognized Jewish religion and culture. It is also known that Cleopatra spoke Aramaic or possibly Hebrew, and that during her reign Jews occupied high positions in Alexandria. Generally, the Ptolemaic dynasty attempted to be friendly with the Jewish community in Alexandria, and encouraged immigration from Judea. Higher estimates claim that up to 1 million Jews may have lived in Egypt during the 1st Century BCE. Jews in Egypt occupied a similar social strata as Greeks. Many were a part of the landed class of soldiers known as cleruchs, and still others were employed as officials and law enforcement. Jewish intellectual life flourished in Alexandria, where a rich Jewish literary tradition developed. Some Jews became Hellenized, while others resisted Greek culture. Hostility between ethnic groups in Egypy did exist, but Alexandria was something of a refuge for Jewish refugees from other parts of the Mediterranean. However, it would be wrong to claim that the relationship between the Ptolemaic dynasty and their Jewish subjects was always amicable. The Ptolemies were notoriously despotic, and their tolerance towards the Jews depended on their willingness to serve the needs of the monarchy. It was out of practicality not goodness that the Ptolemaic dynasty built a multi-cultural empire. It is also worth noting that some of Cleopatra\\'s own Seleucid relatives had outlawed Jewish religious rites and attempted to persecute the Jews in Judea. On the other hand the vast majority had formed bonds with Jewish communities and even helped fund the construction of synagogues and schools. Greek accounts reflect the ambiguity of the relationship, as do Jewish sources like the Scriptures, particularly 3 Maccabees. In 3 Maccabees, Ptolemy IV is described as bitterly persecuting Jews and attempting to destroy them with elephants, until angels of the Lord turn the elephants against his men. This miracle brings Ptolemy IV to his senses, and inspires him to reverse his policy towards the Jews and attempt to make amends with them. Josephus describes Ptolemy VIII as persecuting the Jews like Ptolemy IV did, but describes other Ptolemies as having been beloved by the Jews in Egypt. In doing so, he more or less paints a picture of the Ptolemaic dynasty extending tolerance to the Jews with the exception of \"bad apples\" like Ptolemy IV and VIII, and Cleopatra VII. Josephus\\' account looks very different to the picture painted by other sources, which indicates that Egypt and especially Alexandria was a safe haven for Jewish communities. #2/2: Sources & background for Josephus It is also worth looking at the two possible sources for Josephus to get an understanding of why she is described in this way. First is Herod, who influenced both Josephus and Nicolaus. Cleopatra and Herod had a complicated relationship. Herod\\'s father Antipatros was an ally to both Cleopatra and her father, helping restore them to their thrones. It\\'s not surprising that as a young man Herod briefly sought refuge at Cleopatra\\'s court. However, Cleopatra and Herod ended up growing hostile after he was appointed king of Judaea by Marc Antony, because they both sought control of the same territories in the Levant, including Tyre, Jericho, Gaza, Acre and Askalon. Cleopatra likely had plans to annex Judaea before Herod was appointed king, as the Ptolemies had briefly controlled the country. Cleopatra was the biggest fish in the eastern Mediterranean, but Herod came in second. Because of this dynamic they were natural rivals, and Marc Antony was obliged to find compromises between them, though he usually sided with Herod. Herod\\'s appointment as king by the Romans was not without opposition, especially in light of the fact that the Hasmonean dynasty which had previously ruled Judaea still existed. Herod married a Hasmonean princess Mariamne to connect himself to that family, but still feared being usurped. His brother-in-law Aristobulus III was a major threat to him as a potential rival, and Herod attempted to block him from the High Priesthood that was his birthright. This is where Cleopatra comes in according to Herod/Nicolaus via Josephus, who claims Aristobulus\\' mother Alexandra complained directly to Cleopatra, who had the ear of Marc Antony. Due to pressure from Antony, Herod was compelled to make Aristobulus\\' High Priest, but he resented Cleopatra\\'s meddling in his affairs. Cleopatra continued to hear Alexandra\\'s concerns and offer her assistance up until the point that Herod had Aristobulus drowned. Cleopatra also pitted Herod\\'s cousin Malchos against him, making an enemy of both of them in turn. Their relationship only grew worse as war broke out between Cleopatra and Augustus, with Herod deserting her and Antony\\'s cause at the very end. While Cleopatra may not have been hostile to the Jewish people as a whole, she was hostile to Herod/his dynasty. The other source, Nicolaus, was a Greek historian, initially the tutor to Cleoptra\\'s children. After her death he ended up serving Augustus and Herod. The works he wrote at their courts are necessarily biased in favour of his patrons, and often paint Cleopatra out as a vain tyrant. Both authors wrote to flatter Augustus, and Herod also flattered himself to a great deal. Because these were his two primary sources, the information Josephus had access to was already distorted. The portrayal of Cleopatra in late Antique Jewish literature is interesting in and of itself. Cleopatra anachronistically appears in the Talmud, as a generally negative figure. According to the Talmud, a queen Cleopatra of Alexandria asked Rabbi Meir (who lived hundreds of years later) about resurrection and the Book of Psalms. In another apocryphal story, she dissects a pregnant servant who had been condemned to death, in order to learn more about gestation. Both of these traditions are unflattering, one portrays her as theologically ignorant and the other describes her as a sadistic scientist. This implies that there was a certain ambivalence to Cleopatra in Jewish literary traditions, however hazy and apocryphal. Whether this might derive from older animosity between Cleopatra and the Jewish communities in Egypt or Judea is unclear. Ultimately, there are huge gaps in our knowledge of Cleopatra\\'s reign, which is less well documented in Egypt\\'s archaeological record than many of her ancestors. Although Josephus\\' account can not be disproven, it is treated with suspicion by modern historians. #Sources Cleopatra: a biography by Roller Jewish Perspectives on Hellenistic Rulers edited by Rajak, Aitken, Dines & Pearce The Reign of Cleopatra by Burstein Egypt in the Age of Cleopatra by Chauveau',\n",
       " \"The men who wrote Yes Minister (Anthony Jay and Jonathan Lynn) did so using information supplied to them from real government officials, and in using it tried their best to make a show about bureaucracy funny. But to what extent did the Civil Service really subvert its political masters during the last century’s latter half? It’s hard to answer such a broad question and when you’re dealing with an organization that encompasses the entirety of a G7 government, you’re bound to get a lot of variance in experience. Practically, I don’t think I can give you an answer that covers the entirety of the second half of the 20th century, so let’s instead look at the views and experiences of the people who influenced Yes Minister and what they can tell us about the realities of the Minister-Whitehall relationship. First, some context for anyone unfamiliar with Yes Minister and the system it satirizes. The UK government is divided into departments for different policy areas, and each department is headed up by a Minister (often called a “Secretary of State” for that area or just “Secretary”). So foreign affairs are overseen by the Foreign Secretary, crime and immigration has the Home Secretary, health has the Health Secretary etc. These people are Members of Parliament (MPs) elected to represent constituencies around the country in the House of Commons, Parliament’s lower (and dominant) chamber. In UK elections, candidates from the various parties run in each constituency and (almost always) the party that elects the most MPs (usually an overall majority) forms the government. Ministers are named to their departments by the Prime Minister, who is almost always their party’s leader. Members of Parliament’s upper chamber (the House of Lords) can also be made ministers but this is usually for more junior posts. A department’s work is carried out by civil servants, apolitical officials who implement the government’s agenda. The civil servants in each department are organized into a hierarchy of roles and responsibilities headed up by someone called a Permanent Secretary. A Minister works with a Permanent Secretary (Perm Sec) to run the department, with the Minister accountable to Parliament for what the department does. Ideally, the democratically elected government implements its policies with the advice of an experienced and apolitical Civil Service, which makes the government’s wishes into reality. In Yes Minister, an MP called Jim Hacker runs the fictional Department for Administrative Affairs (DAA), whose Perm Sec is called Sir Humphrey Appleby. The theme of the show is Jim Hacker trying to accomplish governmental goals, and Sir Humphrey impeding him with bureaucratic obstructionism. In Yes Minister, the Civil Service is a never-changing government run by privately educated Oxbridge elitists obsessed with maintaining the status quo. What’s more, the Sir Humphrey model of civil servant is a generalist with no specific expertise in the operations he oversees. He did Classics at university, not some obscure technical discipline. This generalist class of administrators is eternal in Yes Minister’s world. Politicians come and go, but the Civil Service stays the same. Now to get into some actual history (finally). Richard Crossman was a Labour MP first elected in 1945. In 1964, he became the Minister for Housing and Local Government under Prime Minister Harold Wilson, and held a couple more portfolios after that. Before he was a Minister, he criticized the post war Labour government of Clement Atlee for its “uncritical reliance on Whitehall.” He thought that a good left-wing government should rely more on expert advice “from an influx of experts with special knowledge, new ideas and a sympathy for the government’s domestic and foreign policies.” He brought his views on the Civil Service with him when he became a Minister. In 1966, he told a special committee that was examining Civil Service reform that “the higher Civil Service was a coherent and cohesive oligarchy presenting Ministers with narrow alternatives of choice.” Crossman’s diaries – published posthumously in 1975 – recounted his rows with the Perm Sec at Housing, the formidable Dame Evelyn Sharp. The diary’s publication came in spite of concerted opposition from the government since – according to Lynn – “the diaries revealed that the Civil Service runs the country.” So, from that perspective you could say that (for 20 years at least) the Civil Service had been subverting Ministers to quite a considerable extent. Since Lynn calls Crossman (through his diaries) “our best source,” it’s worth looking at some examples of his relationship with Whitehall. When Crossman was Housing Minister, Labour wanted to create a new Ministry of Land and Planning to manage the supply of land for the implementation of its agenda on housing. This meant transferring land use planning authority from Sharp’s ministry. Crossman was supportive of the plan but Sharp managed to keep the relevant powers under her department’s purview. In 1969, Crossman (now at Health and Social Security) had to overcome Civil Service resistance to creating the Hospital Advisory Service, which reported on conditions in hospitals for the elderly and mentally ill. There he was successful, but he had to work for it. In the same year, he asked his officials to look into reallocating 11% of general hospital expenditures toward targeted spending on long-stay hospitals with a priority on the mentally ill. This generated intense opposition from the health bureaucracy and Crossman had to abandon the idea, instead settling for much less money from central department reserves. There’s a lot more to Crossman’s work on this issue but I’m already running long so I’ll leave it there (I’m already probably getting too big for my britches, as I’m by no means an authority on UK healthcare or housing policy). That’s just 3 (very simplified) examples from Crossman’s 6 years in government, but they paint a picture that’s eerily reminiscent of Yes Minister. Still, they’re hardly indicative of his overall experience, and while his relationship with the Civil Service was strained, he came to understand its inner workings and how to make it work toward his goals. In 1971 he delivered a lecture where he said My final lesson is this. People often say to me “Look Mr. Crossman, the system. It really doesn’t work does it?” Let me tell you something. I spent six years inside the system. I think it works extremely well…We have a Civil Service which will carry out the programmes of politicians, provided the politicians are willing to fight day and night for their ideas. Of course if you will not fight for your ideas, if you simply say to the civil servants “Please carry this out,” they will not. But once you know you are serious a change takes place. Suddenly it is all sweetness and light and you can get it done. I see nothing in the system which would have stopped us from doing much better than we did. If we failed, it was because we made mistakes. I think I would conclude by saying, “The fault, dear Brutus, lies not in our civil servants but in ourselves.” I don’t think that’s the view of a man who was stymied by the Civil Service at every turn. It strikes me more of a pragmatist who learned how to understand a complex system and how best to work within it. Moderated though they may have been with time, Crossman’s views on the Civil Service were hardly unique. Harold Wilson’s advisor Marcia Williams (a source for Lynn and Jay) felt that Labour’s failings in government were attributable to the work of a Civil Service she mistrusted and disliked. The same was true for Wilson’s economic advisor Thomas Balogh, who railed against what he called an “ignorantly dilettante bureaucracy.” He felt that civil servants kept information from Ministers for their own gain, and complained to Wilson that “a large part of the bureaucracy does not share our views.” When Wilson returned to office in 1974, he appointed Bernard Donoughue to set up the new Number 10 Policy Unit, which would have to work closely with civil servants. Donoughue ended up being an important source for Lynn and Jay for both plot ideas and checking scripts. He had a complicated relationship with Whitehall, especially the Treasury, one of the most powerful departments, which was being potentially undercut by a new source of independent economic advice within Number 10. Still, a working relationship developed that was antithetical to the anti-Civil Service attitudes of Balogh and Williams. While they were both sources for Lynn and Jay, they always met Donoughue and Williams separately, as the two hated each other. The upshot of this answer to a question you didn’t really ask is that the Civil Service depicted in Yes Minister is one informed by the views of people who had complicated relationships with it. In the officials described in Crossman’s diaries, as well as the recollections of Williams and Donoughue, we can certainly see the bureaucratic obstructionism of Sir Humphrey and the capacity to subvert the will of elected representatives. Still, Crossman’s self-reflective words remind us that blaming every failure on obstinate bureaucrats is at best a simplistic view that shirks responsibility. If I had more time and energy, I’d love to get into a discussion of the Civil Service pre-1964, its relationship with Heath, and its evolution under Thatcher. Maybe someone else can fill in some blanks there, and while they’re at it poke holes in what I’ve written (I’m sure there are plenty). Still, I hope that this has provided some insight into the (Prime) Minister – Whitehall relationship, and how to view the bureaucracy's famous tendencies to thwart the will of its political masters.

       " '\"The last four bond drives came up so short we just printed money instead. Ask any smart boy on Wall Street, he’ll tell ya. Our dolls next to worthless, we’ve borrowed so much and nobody’s lending anymore.\" This is misleading. A government printing loads of money to finance its expenses should cause inflation. While 1941 and 1942 did see inflation over 10% (which was high given hardly any inflation at all in the 1930s, it dropped in 1943-45. Higher inflation levels would return, but after the war. Some Bureau of Labor statistics on the Consumer Price Index for the period can be found here Furthermore, the US government was not just funding the war by printing dollars. A large portion of it was financed by a vast overhaul and expansion of taxation, namely income taxes. Much of how the US income tax system functions is actually a result of wartime measures. The Roosevelt administration had pursued federal income tax reform in its first term. After tax reform passed in 1935, the top income bracket was 79% collected on incomes over $5 million (which applied to literally one American, John D. Rockefeller). The minimum taxable income level for a married couple was $2,000 a year, or more than what three-fourths of families actually earned. A couple with two children and earning $4,000 a year would have been among the top tenth of household earners - and would have paid $16 in income taxes. Fewer than one in twenty American households paid any federal income tax at all, and it was a small portion of federal revenues collected. The Revenue Act of 1942 radically and permanently changed this. The minimum taxable personal income threshold was reduced to $624 (or about half of the median annual income), which meant that some 13 million more Americans had to now pay federal income taxes (only some 4 million had met the threshold before the war). Rising wages and employment meant that by war\\'s end some 42.6 million Americans were paying income taxes. One of the ways taxpaying permanently changed was by changing the method of collection. Before 1943, income taxes were paid to the Treasury quarterly (much as you still do if you\\'re an independent contractor). But daily needs for wartime financing found this method too slow, and in 1943 it was switched to withholding directly from employees\\' paychecks, as it continues to this day. The percentage of income taxes as a total of federal revenue shot up to a level where it also remains to this day (more than corporate taxes). Congress would eventually resist further proposed tax increases by the Roosevelt administration, passing a Revenue Act of 1943 over FDR\\'s veto with large numbers of tax exemptions (another feature that continues to this day). Nevertheless, some 45% of the US war cost of about $304 billion was funded directly through taxation, a level higher than had been the case for the Civil War or World War I (albeit lower than Germany\\'s 48%, the UK\\'s 53% or the Canada\\'s 55%). The rest of the cost was funded through borrowing, or through the issuing of war bonds. While much of the funding came from personal subscriptions to war bonds, notably the Series E Bond, we should be clear that this only accounted for about a quarter of the $200 or so borrowed by the US government during the war years - the rest was borrowed by banks and other financial institutions. Commercial banks alone went from holding $1 billion of US bonds in 1941 to over $24 billion in 1945. It was actually financial institutions cashing out these bonds after the war that caused the rise in the money supply and inflation. If you asked a smart boy in Wall Street about this and they told you everything was financed by printed money during the war, they were either pulling one over on you or not very good at their jobs. \"Ships aren’t being built, tanks aren’t being built, machine guns, bazookas, hand grenades. Zip.\" I\\'m not sure how a US Treasury official could claim this with a straight face. It was pretty obvious even to the American public just how much the US was producing for the war effort. US industrial output was already the world\\'s largest in 1941, and it doubled in size in four years. By 1942, the US was already outproducing all of the Axis powers combined, and overall by war\\'s end produced an estimated two-thirds of all Allied military equipment: 297,000 aircraft, 193,000 artillery pieces, 86,000 tanks, 2 million trucks, 8,800 naval vessels, and 87,000 landing craft. For every one major Japanese ship launched during the war, the US launched sixteen. I don\\'t have tables handy but I believe 1944 was the highest year for war materiel production, and the only reason that 1945 saw a drop is because of orders being cancelled with the war\\'s end that year. \"don’t be surprised if your plane doesn’t make it off the runway because the fuel dumps are empty and our good friends the Arabs are only taking bullion.\" This line actually caught my eye first, and seems very weird. The bullion line is actually true, kind of. Standard Oil of California had first gained a drilling concession from the Saudi Arabia in 1933. Texas Oil later bought a stake, and after years of little result, finally oil was struck in 1938. The company name was changed to Arab-American Oil Company (Aramco), which is still Saudi Arabia\\'s major producer of oil. The Saudi Arabian government bought out the company in the 1970s, but until then it was a consortium of American corporations operating a concession. By agreement they paid royalties to the Saudi government - the original 1933 deal was four gold schillings for every ton of oil pumped. Of course, Aramco was a private company, and from 1934 the US Treasury would only redeem US dollars in gold with foreign governments, and private US persons were not allowed to keep gold. Aramco therefore had to obtain gold from other sources, such as the Argentine and South African governments, in order to pay its royalties. The US Treasury sometimes helped to facilitate these deals, but it was not supplying gold directly. Even with that being the case, the US itself was still by far the biggest producer of oil in the world, pumping some 60% of the world\\'s crude (the second and third biggest producers were Venezuela and the USSR). While security of oil supplies was of vital concern to the US and all governments during the war, especially as usage rose, the US was still exporting oil to Allies rather than importing it in large quantities from the Middle East. Honestly, the picture painted of the United States - high inflation, industries going dormant, the country paying through the nose for Middle Eastern oil, and GIs suffering the effects of an indifferent American public - sounds much more like 1975 than 1945, and I suspect that is what Clint Eastwood was really taking as his inspiration (I\\'m just blaming him even though he didn\\'t write the script).

       " 'I am going to limit the scope of my answer to the popes of the late medieval and early modern popes, such Alexander VI (Rodrigo Borgia). Criticism of the popes was quite common. To list all instances of such would leave us here all day. One of the most famous examples is found in Dante’s Inferno. During his journey, Dante meets Pope Nicholas III in the eight circle of hell. As this is where people are sent for simony (the crime of acquiring church offices through bribes) Dante naturally assumes that it is Boniface VIII. Nicholas III quickly identifies himself and corrects Dante, but admits the mistake is not a great one: Boniface VIII is on his way, with Clement V soon to follow. It is also hinted that Celestine V met a similar end. The pope following Alexander VI, (disregarding Pius III’s two day pontificate) Julius II refused to live in the same apartments that Alexander had occupied. Posthumous trials, condemnations, and reversal of policies were common place for popes as well. So a better question might be, why were such obviously wicked popes allowed to remain in power? Certainly no list can be exhaustive, but we ought to consider a few major factors. First, Catholic teaching is clear that the virtue of the minister of the sacraments has no effect on their efficacy. Such teaching traces back to the Donatist controversy of the fourth and fifth centuries. It is God who works in the sacraments, not the priest or bishop. Bishops therefore ought to be disciplines for their wayward actions, but doing so was not a pressing concern insofar as maintaining proper sacraments in the Church. Second, we should note that many of these popes engaged in things that offset the downsides in the eyes of many. Alexander VI’s sex life was a PR problem for sure. But a good pope must be more than a role model, he must be an effective administrator and politician. By those metrics, Alexander VI was quite successful. He made many procedural reforms to the curia, and the manner in which the church acquired and sold real estate. He founded universities in Scotland and Spain, and he was a generous patron of the arts. So for many the benefits of Alexander VI’s papacy outweighed the costs. Finally, even if they wished to remove a pope for continuous moral failing, how would that be done? Removing a pope for any reason was incredibly problematic. The pope could not just be fired: he had a kingdom, army, and allies to call upon. Attempts to remove sitting popes were often disastrous. Upon regretting their decision to elect Urban VI in April of 1378, the curia elected Clement VII. Unfortunately, Urban VI did not recognize such a decision as valid. This ignited the “Great Western Schism” which resulted in several wars and lasted until 1417. At one point there were even three claimants to the papacy. So for popes after 1417 even those who, in theory, wanted their removal would pause and think twice? Was the existence of Cesare Borgia really worth plunging Europe into another war over? In most cases not. In conclusion the idea of breaking with or removing a pope involved major questions over not just theology and morals, but also politics and economics.',\n",
       " 'A caveat before I start: the figures I produce are going to be only very rough estimates. Not only do I have to factor in inflation from the 14th century to the 21st and then convert British pounds into USD, but I have to convert medieval French currency into medieval English currency before this, and as a result there are a lot of areas where errors can enter into the calculations. These are going to be ballpark figures at best. So, what are the numbers of the armies? Unfortunately, we don\\'t have the administrative records to fully reconstruct either side and have to rely on numbers provided by chroniclers. We do know that the Black Prince brought approximately 2600 men to Bordeaux in 1355 in anticipation for that raid, which breaks down into ~1000 men-at-arms, ~1000 mounted archers, ~400 foot archers and ~170 Welshmen. It\\'s likely that most of these men survived the 1355 campaign, and some additional archers from Gascony may have joined them as several reliable chronicles give the English 2000 archers during the battle. Additionally, 2000 Gascon men-at-arms and 1000 javelin men (\"bidauts\") joined him for the campaign. Some sources suggest 3000 men-at-arms joined, giving a total of 4000 for the English, but most chronicles only list 2000, so this is the number I\\'m choosing to work with. The number of the French is harder to pin down. A number of chroniclers, such as Geoffrey le Baker, Sir Thomas Grey and the Anonimalle Chronicle, list the French as having 8000 men-at-arms, while the Chandos Herald lists what was likely around 11 000 men-at-arms (10 400 mean, plus a reserve with 23 banners) and the Chronique Normande has 12 000 men-at-arms. Similarly, while Baker and the Anonimalle Chronicle give the French 3000 crossbowmen and other infantry, the Chandos Herald has 4000. Clifford J. Rogers prefers the Chandos Herald\\'s numbers on the basis that the Herald states that he used official lists to count the number of men-at-arms, and it may well be that there were 2000 crossbowmen, 1000 pavisiers and 1000 bidauts in the French army as some sources for Crecy have bidauts going forward with the Genoese. However, scout reports prior to Crecy mention 12 000 French men-at-arms, 8000 of which were knights or squires, which may suggest that there were 4000 armed valets. This would reconcile the numbers reasonable well, with some sources referring to all the armed men on horses and others record just the men-at-arms. As such, I\\'m choosing the give the French 8000 knights and squires, 4000 armed valets, 2000 crossbowmen, 1000 pavisiers and 1000 bidauts. What of wages? I\\'ve made two tables of wages, one for the English and one for the French. The French rates are based on a 1351 ordinnance from Jean II, as I haven\\'t been able to find examples specifically drawn from contracts in the books I have access to, while the English are drawn from actual contracts. In both cases, the rate for the bidauts is only an estimate, based on pay for foot archers in the case of the English and older levels of pay compared to newer levels of pay in the case of the French. Additionally, I\\'m going to be assuming that the Gascon soldiers were paid in English money, although they were actually paid both in English and French money, as this simplifies things considerably. English Wages Type | Pay (d/day) ---|--- Banneret | 48 Knight | 24 Man-at-arms | 12 Mounted archer | 6 Bidaut | 3 French Wages Type | Pay (s.t./day) ---|--- Banneret | 40 Knight | 20 Squire (man-at-arms) | 10 Armed Valet | 5 Crossbowman | 3 Pavisier | 2.5 Bidaut | 1.5 For reference, in terms of pure silver one pound sterling was 259.74g and one pound tournois theoretically had 56g of silver. In commercial terms however, when measured against the florin and ducat as international standards, one pound stirling equaled £8 6s. 8d. tournois in 1350, and the tournois pound fluctuated during the 1350s, likely as a result of the rampant debasement and economic crises occurred in France. For the sake of my sanity, I\\'m going to use the 1350 value, because in 1356 the pound stirling could be equal to £4 6s. 8d. tournai, or it could be equal to £11 tournai, and there\\'s really no good way to estimate the value otherwise. This is, in any case, in the ballpark for conversion rates between English and French currencies in 1305 and 1306, which did fluctuate significantly, so is a useful comparison. Now that we have the rates of pay and total numbers of the armies, we need to work out the proportions of bannerets, knights and men-at-arms/squires. In France, we have pretty good evidence over general trends, especially in large forces. Overall, between 1351 and 1368, the breakdown was 0.9% bannerets, 12% knights and 87.1% men-at-arms, although in specific instances, the number of bannerets could be as high as 1.4% and the knights as high as 15%. As the army at Poitiers was quite a large army, and large armies tend towards higher proportions of men-at-arms, I\\'ll assume that 1% of the heavy cavalry were bannerets, 12% were knights and 87% were men-at-arms. We have less evidence for England, surprisingly, but what we see from 1368 onwards - combined with a few scattered break downs provided in indentures - suggest a slightly higher proportion of knights in English service than French in 1356. For this reason, I\\'m choosing to use a figure of 1.4% bannerets, 15% knights and 83.6% men-at-arms. From here, we can calculate approximately daily wages for the armies, and then the monthly wages: English Army Type | Number | Daily Wage (d) ---|---|---- Bannerets | 42 | 2016 Knights | 450 | 10 800 Men-at-arms | 2508 | 30 096 Mounted Archer | 2000 | 12 000 Bidaut | 1000 | 3000 Total (£ daily) | | £240 6s. Total (£ monthly) | | £7239 French Army Type | Number | Daily Wage (s.t) ---|---|---- Bannerets | 80 | 3200 Knights | 960 | 19 200 Men-at-arms | 6940 | 69 400 Armed Valet | 4000 | 20 000 Crossbowmen | 2000 | 6000 Pavisiers | 1000 | 2500 Bidaut | 1000 | 1500 Total (s.t. daily) | | 121 800 Total (l.t. monthly) | | £182 700 Converting the French figure using the relative values of the currencies compared to the florin, the French wages come to £21 932 15s. 5d. Stirling. The total is approximately three times the wages of the English army, which is in the right ballpark for the composition, so I think the figure is a fairly reasonable one. Now, to convert from medieval currency to modern currency. Using the calculator here the simple RPI figure, the English monthly wage comes out as £4 929 000 in 2017, and the French monthly wage comes out as £14 930 000 in 2017. In USD, this is $6 340 000 for the English and $19 200 000. For comparison, 6000 soldiers paid at the modern English minimum wage (£7.83 in 2017 for those over 25), assuming an 8 hour work day and pay for every day of the week, would cost £11 275 200 (14 500 000 USD). Let\\'s look at another type of conversion: the labour value of the commodity basket. Using this method of conversion, the English wages would be £58 430 000 (75 200 000 USD) and the French wages would be £177 000 000 (228 000 000 USD). This is probably a better measure, as the daily wage for a thatcher\\'s mate in the 1350s (2d) comes out at £64.57, which is very close to modern minimum wage (again, assuming 8 hours work). So there you have it! The English army at Poitiers cost $75 200 000 in wages per month, and the French army had $228 000 000. This is, as I said at the start of the post, only an approximate estimate, but I think it should give you some context for what armies in this period cost to run. I\\'ll also add that there were up-front costs paid in addition to wages called \"regards\", which were essentially sign up bonuses, so the overall cost would be higher than the first glance would suggest. High ranking nobles were also paid a much higher wage (the Black Prince earning more than £8000 for the 1355 campaign), albeit one that was arbitrarily negotiated, and tended to be paid as a lump sum rather than as a daily rate, which is why they\\'ve been omitted here.

       " \"How do non-Western countries such as China teach the Crusades? Are they seen in a good or bad light? Do they even teach Western history in China? I cannot read (modern) Chinese by myself, so my answer almost only concerns the representation of the Crusade in the historical science as well as education of history in Japan since the opening of Japan in the middle of the 19th century. In 1860s and 1870s, the Japanese imported some American as well as British overview works of history, and the Crusade had began to be taught as an episode of 'World History' found in them. As early as ca. 1870, Philosopher and Teacher Amane NISHI (1830-97) seemed to translated the crusade as 十字軍 (literal meaning: the expedition of the cross) (Yatsuzuka 2008: 16-20). Nishi was then hired by the Ministry of Education to collect the possible candidate of textbooks for western style higher education (university), and these books and their translations were meant to use history textbooks in the newly founded university in Meiji Japan. Thus, by the end of the 1880s (in 1886, the Meiji Government issued a law to found the western style Imperial universities also in Japan), the crusade as an episode in European (Occidental) history was also known in Japan. It is worth noting, however, that very few historians had shown interest in the crusade itself at least until the middle of the 20th century (more strictly speaking, the beginning of the 1960s), after WWII in Japan. Their traditional representation of the crusade, based on the Anglophone (Protestant) popular and educational history in the 19th century, was mainly characterized as a symbol of the material greed mantled by the fanatic religiosity in European Middle Ages, and some elements in the crusade, such as Children's Crusade, had somehow attracted much popular attention by some unknown reasons (probably the episode instigated the curiosity of the Japanese toward alien area and period). As I mentioned 1960s was a turn of tide in the reception of the crusade books in Japan. Church historian Hashiguchi (AFAIK almost first history) professor specialized in the crusade in Japan) began to study the crusade, and translated some post-WWII crusade books into Japanese, such as that of Orientalist René Grousset (originally written in 1948). Then, the main source of reception of the crusade study (at least for historians, non popular history books) switched from the Anglophone study to the French and German historiography, though this change still does not reflect well in popular history in Japan. Since 1980s, at least one or two Japanese historians constantly publish academic articles on the Crusade, though mostly only in Japanese (so not so many non-Asian historians know their existence) (Cf. Abe 1974; Yatsuzuka 2008). Last year, the first detailed academic monograph on the Crusade in Japanese has just finally been written by Sakurai and published (Sakurai 2020). On the other hand, the age-old tradition of the crusade, moved by the greed of Christians, is still prevailed in the popular history as well as sub-culture in the 21th century. It has indeed partly been enhanced by Japanese localization of Western historical movies like the Kingdom of Heaven, as well as Amin Maalouf's famous Crusades through Arab's Eyes. So, overall, the image of the Crusade in Japan has been negative. Relative relative vitality of pre-modern Islamic study (the history of the Middle East) in Japan might also contributed to this trend. In Japan, a few biography of Saladin for general audiences has recently been published, though most of them are very brief (not so detailed). References: Kin'ya ABE.

       " \"This is an interesting question and has a long history of debate in not only academic circles but also politics. Kate Frieson in an article for Pacific Affairs in the Autumn issue of 1988 said that “The Democratic Kampuchean Regime (1975-1979) has been labelled Marxist-Leninist, Maoist, peasant-populist, national chauvinist and even fascist by various observers of Cambodia.” The range here, I think in the ‘early days’ particularly, was sometimes due to different political leanings of the person who was answering the question. Was Democratic Kampuchea representative of the purest communist revolution the world had ever seen? A racist abomination that was the farthest thing from Marxism? A totalitarian state comparable to Stalin’s USSR? However, I think (in many circles at least) since the end of the Cold War there has been an effort to provide a more nuanced answer, less tinged with biases left or right and I would contend that the Khmer Rouge revolution can, to a large extent, be considered “communist”. Now, this relies on some caveats and positioning, and no doubt this answer will still attract responses of that aforementioned political divide, so I present this as my own opinion based on the evidence I see fit and historians which I think make the most sense on the topic. I should also add that I believe it is important to take into account the words of the Khmer Rouge themselves as who else would be better positioned to tell you what they were trying to accomplish. I'm also copying and pasting a little from previous answers I have made so I hope this flows... Firstly, I think it is worth saying that the Khmer Rouge revolution was in many ways unique, while also being reminiscent of other periods of turmoil, violence and revolution throughout history. In the same way that it can largely be considered a communist revolution, it can also be thought of as a unique take on that ideological framework. I guess the answer that you or someone else might have can differ depending on how close to an orthodox Marxist revolution something needs to be in order to be considered a communist one. Do the Russian and Chinese revolutions count? Do the ‘gospels’ of Lenin, Stalin or Mao figure into what you still consider to be ‘communist thinking’? If so, then the Khmer Rouge represent another communist revolution which incorporated elements from these previous examples, as well as the French Revolution, into their actions. Remembering the ideological ‘fermentation’ of the CPK, Pol Pot said that “We applied ourselves to define a direction and then to put it into practise without knowing whether it was right or wrong. There was no model, no blueprint, but rather a mixture of influences, a little of this, a little of that …” “Marxism-Leninism,” Sar said later, “resides within the movements forged by the people, and the people’s movement in each country puts together its own Marxism-Leninism’. The inference was that there was no need for Party members to study the Marxist classics and therefore no need to translate them into Khmer. Sar acknowledged that foreign experience could provide useful lessons. But the goal was an authentically Khmer doctrine, rooted in Cambodian identity. (Philip Short, Pol Pot) These examples from the mouth of the leader of the movement point to the pastiche of influences which, as well as the different cultural influences and context of Cambodia in the 20th century, culminated in a “communist” view of the world, but a “Cambodian” one. Was it an ‘orthodox’ Marxist revolution? No. But Pol Pot et al hoped that “that Democratic Kampuchea would thereby by forged into an agriculturally self-sufficient and industrialised country that would surpass all other countries in the rapid achievement of communist prosperity and strength and thus become totally independent from all foreign countries, whether capitalist or ‘socialist’, and impervious to any military threats they might pose to state territory.” (Steve Heder, Racism, Marxism, Labelling and Genocide in Ben Kiernan’s Pol Pot Regime) If one considers Maoism to be a form of communism, then the huge influence that the Chinese leader had on the Khmer Rouge makes it hard to argue they were anything but communist. “There was much in the Khmer Rouge ideology and practise that was clearly Maoist. The borrowings were first linguistic. Slogans like ‘the super great leap forward’, ‘the wind from the East always vanquishes the wind from the West’, ‘everyone has to rely solely on his own strength’, ‘if you have a revolutionary consciousness, you can do anything’, and ‘revolution is not a banquet’ were light touch plagiarism of Mao’s words. Then came the Khmer Rouge’s applications: the imposition of slave labour, the ambition to ‘turn the Khmers into rice-producing machines who consume no fuel and not too much rice’, and the abolition of all currency and salary distinctions (an idea that Mao toyed with in the last two years of his life). The evacuation of the cities was an extreme version of the Cultural Revolution-era rustification. The creation of mess halls and the abolition of family dining replicated the collectivisation of the Great Leap Forward. (Julia Lovell, Maoism A Global History) cont...\",\n",
       " 'The source for this is Plutarch, which generally ain\\'t great. He says that King Pyrrhus of Epirus (in his Pyrrhus 26ff) invaded the Peloponnese and assaulted Lakonia in 272 BCE, and that the Spartan king Areus I \"was not at home, but in Crete, whither he was bringing military aid for the Gortynians.\" The Cretan city of Gortys was at war with Knossos at this time, though I can find no real information about this conflict or Sparta\\'s role in it. It is not mentioned in the Cambridge Ancient History at all. From what Plutarch has to say, it seems we are to believe that a significant force of Spartans was on Crete, since Pyrrhus and his pet Spartan dissident Cleonymos falsely believed that the city was in serious danger due to the absence of the men. Plutarch continues: When night had come, the Lacedaemonians at first took counsel to send their women off to Crete, but the women were opposed to this; and Archidamia came with a sword in her hand to the senators and upbraided them in behalf of the women for thinking it meet that they should live after Sparta had perished. 3 Next, it was decided to run a trench parallel with the camp of the enemy, and at either end of it to set their waggons, sinking them to the wheel-hubs in the ground, in order that, thus firmly planted, they might impede the advance of the elephants. When they began to carry out this project, there came to them the women and maidens, some of them in their robes, with tunics girt close, and others in their tunics only, to help the elderly men in the work. 4 The men who were going to do the fighting the women ordered to keep quiet, and assuming their share of the task they completed with their own hands a third of the trench.',\n",

       " 'Migration from the Russian Empire to the United States was mostly during the \"Ellis Island\" period of immigration (1880-1920). It should also be noted that many of the immigrants coming from Russia are not necessarily remembered today for their national origin, since they were often either Jewish or German speaking - and they were not necessarily recorded in immigration documents as Russian, and might not have identified that way. However, as country of origin, there were indeed a very large number of immigrants from Russia and they were the third largest group by country of origin in the 1920 census at 1.4 million. Immigrants from Russia tended to follow the immigrant channels from Europe across the Atlantic to the Eastern ports, rather than to the West. If you look at even the modern population distribution in Russia you will see that the population is heavily concentrated in the East. There simply was not much population in the West and no established immigrant route from any Western Russian port to the American West Coast. In comparison the Chinese population was huge and there were existing operations to recruit and transport Chinese labor - for example to Caribbean islands as a substitute for slave labor after it was abolished by the British. This link gives a very brief introduction to the background Chinese labor migration along with sources for further reading: Not all of the immigrants settled along coastal cities. If we take the \"Mountain\" and \"Pacific\" regions to be the \"West\" then there were about 70,000 immigrants from Russia in the West in 1920. That includes everything West of Colorado - the main destinations were Colorado and California. However, if you expand your definition of the West there were also quite significant numbers of immigrants from Russia in the Dakotas, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Kansas (about 80,000-90,000). These are small numbers in comparison to the size of the immigrant population in New York (530,000), but as a proportion of Western immigrants they were quite substantial. In Colorado they were one of the the largest immigrant groups. Depending on your definition of the West we might say around 5-6% of immigrants in that region were of Russian origin in 1920 (a little less than their 10% share of the immigrant population in the whole US).

       " 'To add to the past comments written on this topic, you can generally point to the first generation after the founding, as the framers themselves either died or retired from public life. Obviously, this isn’t universal. Some faded from prominence and have never recovered or were held in lower regard until decades later. The earliest popular example of “deification” was Parson Weems’ “The Life of Washington,” in 1800. Over multiple additions it added apocryphal stories including the chopping down of the cherry tree. Weems added a religious tone to his biography that would be carried forward. Putting Weems and the deification of the framers into period context, the Second Great Awakening began around 1800.

       " 'Most nations around the world have mythical founders, who are credited with establishing the nation and in many cases providing it with its system of government or religion/cultural values. However most of these \"founders\" are often ancient and legendary folk figures. In this regard the US is no different, however being a rather young nation, it does appear odd why ordinary statesmen and lawyers who lived 250 years ago are so heavily idealized almost to the extent of having divine influence. The saint-like treatment of the \"founding fathers\" is part of American exceptionalism, which has existed since the beginning. The US was one of the first federative republics in the world, and the American values of liberty, autonomy, limited government, made the US \"exceptional\" in the eyes of its people from day one. Great importance was placed on the US Constitution and the \"framers\" (i.e. founding fathers) behind it, who were portrayed as brilliant statesmen who wrote an exceptional document that was very liberal for its time because it restricted the powers of the state for the benefit of the \"liberty\" of its citizens which was apparently inconceivable to most of the world across the Atlantic. Americans have always had a strong independent spirit, and their nation is based around shared values rooted in their Constitution. That is what unites a very diverse young country together, hence why American exceptionalism rhetoric is very common in US politics today and has increased since the US acquired superpower status post-WW2. As for the religious aspect of the saint-like worship of the founders, this exceptionalism combines Christianity with civic nationalism. For example, during the Cold War (when the exceptionalism rhetoric was amplified) the biblical phase \"City upon a Hill\", from Jesus\\' Sermon on the Mount, was used by American politicians to describe the US; it was first used by JFK and then popularized with Reagan\\'s famous \"shining city on a hill\" quote that explains that America acts as a \\'beacon of hope\\' for the rest of the world that desires traditional American values such as democracy, liberty, equality, balance of power, limited government etc. Today this phrase is still used by US politicians. The religious dimension behind American exceptionalism has led to the saint-like worship/deification of the lawyers and statesmen who drafted the Constitution. This is the reason why Americans are so hesitant to change/amend the Constitution (like regarding gun rights) even though it has been amended a grand total of 27 times since 1789, because they think it is a perfect document, every word is meant to be, and this explains the success of the US. The US is a great country in many ways, and this explanation is just about why the \"founding fathers\" are revered as saint-like.',\n",
       " 'The wheel did some some use in sub-Saharan Africa, notably in Dahomey. There, and elsewhere in West Africa, there was some use of wheeled vehicles for ceremonial/ritual use. Typically, they were pulled by humans rather than horses or oxen (sometimes they were drawn by the king\\'s wives, the passenger being the king). See Law, R. , \"Wheeled Transport in Pre-Colonial West Africa\", Africa: Journal of the International African Institute 50, 249-262. https://doi.org/10.2307/1159117 https://www.jstor.org/stable/1159117 for more on such use of the wheel. More generally, the wheel is only a labour-saving device is it actually saves labour. The wheeled vehicle itself needs to be made, before which the makers need to learn how to make such vehicles. Vehicles need maintenance and replacement. In particular, lightweight spoked wheels need skill to be made well. For efficient use, wheeled vehicles need roads. Where diseases make it difficult or impossible to keep horses or cattle, people need to push or pull their vehicles. Where such animals are available, pack animals (with less need of roads) compete with wheeled vehicles. Boats also provide competition. For a longer discussion on these additional costs of wheeled vehicles, see: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ihxl2o/why_was_the_wheel_invented_so_late_in_human/ In East Africa, animal-drawn vehicles were sometimes used, but these were typically simple sledges, often a Y-shaped branch. While this is not as efficient as a wheeled vehicle, it is certainly far easier to make. In modern times, where such sledges have been banned from use on roads (to reduce erosion and road maintenance), one response has been to attach wheels, typically solid wooden wheels. Such wheels are quite heavy, and make the vehicle heavier, and the result might be no more efficient than the unwheeled sledge, depending on the load that is carried. For the modern development and spread of wheeled vehicles such as the sledges-turned-wagons above, and wheelbarrows, and hand-carts, see: Paul Starkey, Local transport solutions: People, paradoxes and progress.

       " 'I think you have a bit of a misconception going on here. Martin Van Buren wasn\\'t a poor immigrant who battled xenophobia - he was the son of native-born Abraham Martensen van Buren (a captain in the Albany County Militia during the Revolution), who was the son of native-born Marten Pieterse van Buren, and you have to go back to Cornelis Maessen van Buren, born in the early seventeenth century, MVB\\'s great-great-grandfather, to get to a Van Buren who came over from the Old World. On both sides of his genealogy, there were deep roots in New Netherlands and therefore America. He spoke Dutch as a first language because the Dutch descendants of Albany-area towns like Kinderhook and Valatie (and even of cities like Albany and New York, to some extent) chose to keep their customs and not assimilate into English society. In the late seventeenth century, after New Netherlands was taken over by the English, the Dutch inhabitants were seen as a group that needed to be appeased, not subjugated. Albany, the former Fort Orange and the northern outpost of the colony, very much remained a Dutch city, filled with prosperous and independent Dutch people; there were concerns that they might rebel and allow the French through the border. Eventually, more English people migrated to New Amsterdam/New York City - disproportionately at the higher levels of income. And here\\'s where it gets very telling. Around 1700, Dutch men were over whelmingly, like 99.5%, likely to marry a Dutch woman, but English men, while not entirely exogamous, were more likely to marry a Dutch woman than a English woman. So on the one hand, you have a Dutch community that\\'s determined to be insular, and you have a well-to-do English community with substantial kinship ties to the Dutch one. The colony/state would continue to become more and more English (and other ethnicities) and less and less Dutch-dominated, but in the upper class, English and Dutch were still closely intertwined, and the Dutch families were very much dominant. General Philip Schuyler, for instance, was not only a national name but a New Yorker of purely Dutch ancestry; the Van Rensselaers, the Van Cortlandts (the general\\'s mother was a Van Cortlandt, btw), the Ten Broeks, the Beekmans, the Dyckmans, and more were among the biggest names that still resonate today. Even \"English\" families like the Livingstons were still quite intermarried with the Dutch. This isn\\'t just a case of a few powerful \"holdovers\", but the overall landscape of New York politics. Even if you weren\\'t from one of these well-known families, being descended from New Netherlands Dutch stock would read extremely well in New York. The first assumption would not be \"oh, some immigrant.\" As for the answer to how he managed to become president, Van Buren started out in New York politics, where all of this background worked in his favor. He served as the state attorney general, and then was elected to the Senate to represent New York - and then as now, Congress is a way to use a local-politics campaign to achieve national prominence. Getting to the Senate required the New York-specific connections, but it allowed Van Buren to make connections with politicians outside of the state, to make speeches that would be reported around the country, and serve on committees that had nothing to do with New York. As I noted in an earlier answer about his relationship to slavery and abolition he also practiced politics with an eye for compromise and, well, politics, rather than for a greater goal. Massively involved in party politics, Van Buren did the work to assist others, like Andrew Jackson, in tacit exchange for reciprocal support later. After being elected governor of New York, he was quickly appointed Secretary of State under Jackson, and he was Jackson\\'s running mate in his reelection campaign, which made him vice president. From there, it was a relatively easy stepping-stone to the presidency.',\n",
       " \"Various philosophers generally declared the end of childhood as the moment when the people can have children, making it synonymous with puberty, although it was not uncommon to still not treat them as 'adults'. For example, John of Trevissa makes a distinction between an adolescent (defining it much like modern psychologists tend to define young adults) and a 'grown man', generally assuming that former tends into latter around thirty. But again, the biological or legal issues could have and often did take a back seat in favour of practical considerations. It was not uncommon to consider a person 'grown up' quite arbitrarily, usually after they displayed the ability of living on their own or being fully capable of forming a family, what usually entailed not only ability to have children, but also all the knowledge and skill of doing necessary work typical to their socio-economic class. What could have meant that a people over 20 years of age, especially men, were not treated as adults and were not getting the parental blessing to marry if the parents were not feeling they can help in or maybe take over family business (in case of urban professionals, such as e.g. merchants) or were not adequately well-versed in the nuances of local politics and thus were not yet able to represent the family (in case of nobility). This is reflected in e.g. works of Henry of Bracton, 13th-century lawyer, who mentions that woman is mature only when she is able to take on all duties of a mother and a housewife. These ideas and guidelines were eventually formalized in the canon law following Concordia discordantium canonum written in 12th century and Decretals promulgated by Gregory IX in 1234, where the minimum age allowing marriage to 12 years for girls and 14 years for boys. The notion that people were married at an early age is largely thought to be a projection of well-documented cases of upper echelon of nobility who treated these marriages as the business agreements (later it also extended to gentry and more affluent burghers), and thus are specific to a very narrow part of society, thus bearing no relevance to general trends in historical populaces. But even then, these 'marriages' were often not exactly a matrimonial unions but rather agreements to conduct a marriage after the children of both parties achieve the age allowing them to be married, while they would still retain the right to withdraw consent. For example, an agreement made in 1466 between Englishmen Thomas Stonor and Thomas Rokes stipulated that their underage children are to marry, although the marriage will be valid only after latter come of age and be able to give informed consent that, unless either of them objects to marriage. In general, the age allowing of rendering the informed consent was largely tied to the perceived age of physical and mental maturity and in the high-to-late Middle Ages is was usually considered to be about 14 years for girls and 16 years for boys, with small differences (1-2 years) depending on time and place. Another, similar case of Thomas Clifford who married his 12-year old daughter Elizabeth to William Plumpton’s 18-year old son, stating that the groom promises the said Lord Clifford that they 'should should not lie together till Elizabeth comes to the age of sixteen years'. Later correspondence confirms that Elizabeth got pregnant for the first time when she was 18. Similarly, Katherine Ryche, step-dauther of a gentryman Wiliam Stonor has been betrothed by her father with his business partner, Thomas Betson, significantly older than her. At that point, she was 13-14 years of age, and although technically she would have been able to legally marry, the marriage happened more than two years later, suggesting that the ability of marriage and practice of actual solemnization of the union and transfer from the natal family to the one of a husband were two different things. Of course, even if there were laws and guidelines, it doesn't mean marrying at the lowest age allowed was anywhere close to common. It is true that we know many cases of people marrying their children as early or even earlier, much to the chagrin of the at least some ecclesiastical authorities, but these cases were rare. Very young age is associated with pre-modern marriages chiefly because such exceptional cases were usually people from the nobility and upper middle class, whose life was chronicled far more often and thus is more accessible by historians that the life of largely anonymous (and often illiterate) masses that did not left much beyond the local church ledgers. But it were these masses that formed bulk of society and in general, rich people got married earlier that others, because their support was not an issue. In case of agricultural workers and less affluent artisans, the support and sustenance was usually not a given and thus people married only when the prospective family was ready to actually live on their own. But even then, people like merchants often postponed the marriage of their children to amass more money that would make their life more comfortable or could act as the founding capital for the child's enterprise. Likewise, girls from lower classes were also not uncommonly working for some time after reaching adolescence to earn or pad their dowry. In case of agricultural workers, they generally married when they were able to work on the farm completely on their own, and given physical nature of such work and food availability far from given (especially in lands with less than favourable soil or climate), this meant fully grown people. In addition, when it came to women, the ability off getting pregnant was perfectly understood to not be synonymous for ability to deliver a baby (especially given the state of medicine and nourishment) meaning that girls were usually postponing their marriage until they fully grew, what might have taken few years. All these factors combined meant that an average age of marriage in the Middle Ages or in pre-modern times in general was generally somewhere in between late teens to mid twenties, with girls being usually younger, what is not that different from modern standards. When it comes to physical maturity, one might argue that people in the discussed period matured later than young people do today, due to to various quality of life and morbidity factors. Significant influence of malnourishment caused by sustenance farming and unpredictable yields would have hampered development of substantial part of the population, especially in parts of the continent characterized by poor soils, sub-optimal climate or both. Lack of antibacterial and antiviral medicines that will become commonly available only in the late first half of 20th century heavily contributed to the high infant mortality and complications or simple strain on the overall health level experienced by survivors would have also delayed onset and finish of the puberty. These theoretical deliberations are corroborated by archeological evidence, e.g. one done by Lewis, Shapland and Watts from the Oxford University, where the researchers examined almost 1000 skeletons of the adolescents living in four urban sites in England between 900 and 1550 for the osteological characteristics allowing to evaluate the progress of puberty. They found that although the onset of the latter was usually starting around 10-12 years of age, much like in other areas of Europe both in Middle Ages and today, the development was significantly slower, with the onset of menarche occurring around 15-17 years of age and the male puberty usually ending at 20-21 years. This is significantly longer that in the case of modern adolescents, that go through puberty between 12-17 years in case of girls and 14-18 years for boys, yielding the difference of 2-3 years, with some densely populated urban areas (such as London) usually rising this age by another year or even two. It doesn't seem much, but given the pubertal period lasts for 6-8 years, we have the delay equal to almost 30% of the entire length of the latter.\",\n",
       " 'I have an earlier answer that might interest you: ~~ As I understand it, explicit concern over the psychological (as opposed to physical) impact of child abuse/sexual abuse is a 20th century development; we have some great history of psych flairs who would be able to tell you more about that. However, this is an interesting question because OP has specifically asked about sexual practices that were not considered abuse in a particular historical context. Late antique Jewish moral writing, and then derived from that early Greek Christian authors, comes down very harsh on Greek (and later Latin) institutionalized traditions of pederasty/pedophilia (paiderasteō). The idea of corruption of the boys involved runs deep. Philo of Alexandria, De specialibus legibus III.37-42 explains: Moreover, another evil, much greater than that which we have already mentioned, has made its way among and been let loose upon cities, namely, the love of boys, which formerly was accounted a great infamy even to be spoken of, but which sin is a subject of boasting not only to those who practise it, but even to those who suffer it, and who, being accustomed to bearing the affliction of being treated like women, waste away as to both their souls and bodies, not bearing about them a single spark of a manly character to be kindled into a flame Philo\\'s specific criticism is that being the victim of Greek pederasty makes boys accept and want the practice. In another text, De contemplativa vita, he more obliquely criticizes how pederasts use and discard the youngest boys. Following this line of corruption, early Greek Christian texts will introduce the word paidophthoreō to label the same practice. But rather than the eros/carnal love connotations of paiderasteō, John Martens argues, paidophthoreō invokes a web of meaning of destroy or corrupt. The Didache, a very early Christian text, places paidophthoreō as a crime next to infanticide: the utter destruction of children. Some sensitivity is mandated here. Philo\\'s criticism, after all, is that the victims of pederasty (he uses the older Greek term, although he condemns the practice; there is only one Jewish source that uses paidophthoreō) grow up to be too feminine, and heavens forbid we should accept ancient and medieval ideas of gender boundaries as trans-historical, Platonic ideals. I\\'m not comfortable with the idea of wholesale dismissing gender performance as 100% the result of sexual abuse, no question, move along. However, I think there is a good argument to be made based on contemporary and later traditions that the idea of dealing with sexual abuse/pedophilia by striving to accommodate it, mentally, was implicitly and obliquely recognized by late antique and medieval authors. I\\'m no psychologist and it\\'s important to remember that the modern idea of psychology, mental illnesses, and even emotions are culturally constructed, but it seems to be that modern research finds some resonance in this idea. So I want to turn to a different type of case, fictional narratives of incest. Medieval sources really don\\'t like to discuss sexual abuse of children directly, but as Kathryn Gravdal points out, incest stories present a way around or through the silence by keeping the focus elsewhere. She differentiates between \"canonical incest,\" or degrees of consanguinity for marriage purposes, and incest within the nuclear family. Specifically, we have stories of mother-son and father-daughter incest which are, always, turned towards an ultimately didactic purpose. What I want to highlight here are the very different standard portrayals of those types of incest in hagiographies, narrative poems, and exempla (moral lessons). The prototypical mother-son incest story is, I would argue, the heir of the \"corruption\" critique. In these, the mother is a new widow who sees in her child the spitting image of her dead husband. She initiates the sexually abusive relationship; the boy grows up to fall in love with her. Again, the idea of aligning oneself/accepting the situation as a way to deal, cognitively, finds resonance both in Philo\\'s writing and in modern research. The stories of father-daughter incest are very different, certainly also reflecting gender norms. Here, the father is portrayed as a predator. As with stories of saintly women fleeing arranged marriages, the girls disfigure themselves--even to the point of amputating a hand--and flee their homes. The stories recount their suffering and hardships in the world. These are external consequences, of course, not \"internal\" ones--don\\'t expect to find long descriptions of PTSD-type nightmares or flashbacks. However, these texts (unlike the saints who disfigure themselves to flee marriage, who usually wind up martyred) generally have more upbeat endings. The daughters, after massive suffering, will often wind their way to a husband and children of their own. There is room to see, given the medieval refusal to confront certain subjects directly, these stories as a sort of externalization of internal processes. (A literary topos that medieval writers loved.) Incest is a different case than institutionalized pederasty or early marriage, obviously. However, the parallels between the father-daughter incest narratives and the standard flight from early marriage stories are a really striking overlap that, I argue, justifies an extrapolation from specifically incest to forced sexual activity as a child in other circumstances as well. So with all the care and sensitivity needed to reconstruct premodern emotions, psychology, and sexual norms, plus some careful reading of and through sources, I would argue that we can see both the emotional effects of childhood sexual abuse and an implicit, oblique awareness of them.',\n",
       " 'So strictly speaking, the premise here isn\\'t entirely correct, as it depends greatly on when, how, and where we are talking. It is important to remember that, broadly, there were two forms of camps run by the Nazis: Extermination camps, such as the Reinhard Camps, where the vast majority of new arrivals were murdered within mere hours of their arrival; and Concentration Camps, where large numbers of people were held for reasons that often amounted to nothing more than existing (Hybrids also existed, most famously Auschwitz, but the distinction isn\\'t too important in this vein). In the latter case, extermination was often still the long term goal, but not before every ounce of useful labor had been eked out of the imprisoned bodies as part of the massive system of slave labor employed by the Nazis. In bring this up for two reasons. The first is because in the extermination camps, the murder persons brought there was done as a matter of course, in mere hours, and there was no real opportunity for disease to take root and spread, although it might be worth noting that the grotesque ritual of stripping, shaving, and showering that new arrivals were told they would go through was often presented to them as delousing. Second then, in the concentration camps, widespread disease was not ideal. The inmates of the concentration camps were a workforce. A workforce which were planned to literally work to death, but morbid as it is to discuss, it was a planned death from complete and utter exhaustion at the end of their strength, not one from disease that could strike down swathes of those who still had labor to steal. So this now brings us to the main point, namely that in a concentration camp, attempts were made to prevent outbreaks. Available medical care was rudimentary, limited mostly to prisoners in the camps who had medical training, and were provided with only the barest of supplies by their captors, but it was there. Delousing upon entry was routine, even if it was often ineffective. Rudimentary care existed, and sick persons could be put isolation wards, but it is also important to note that killing the sick as a not uncommon method of dealing with it. For instance, the first arrivals at Chelmno in late 1941 was a group of some 5,000 Roma who had been previously interned in a makeshift concentration camp near Łódź. After an outbreak of typhus saw some 600 or so individuals infected, it was decided the best way to deal with it would be to send all of them, infected or not, to the newly built extermination camp. The prisoner-doctors in the camps would, when able, even hide or downplay those infected, as infections could easily result in out of hand execution, and even the isolation wards of the camps were little more than \\'a place to put people to die\\'. But in any case, the core point here is that epidemics within the camp were something seen as undesirable - for pragmatic reasons rather than concern of welfare - but undesirable nevertheless. But, as I noted at the beginning, you aren\\'t entirely off the mark here, and there are some key exceptions. Most infamous, and possibly what is on your mind, is the situation in some camps near the end of the war, the best known being Bergen-Belsen, where tens of thousands died (including Anne Frank) in early 1945 due to several concurrent outbreaks of disease, best remembered being typhus. But it is important to emphasize that this was early 1945. Nazi Germany was falling apart, with the Allied powers closing in from both East and West. Bergen-Belsen was specifically being used as a collection point for the evacuation of the inmates of camps further to the east at that point, and the number contained there increased several fold over that it had been intended for, from 15,000 in late \\'44 to over 60,000 by April. The cramped over crowding, combined with the complete disregard for even the most basic welfare of the camp population by the guards - there was no running water or bathroom facilities of any kind in the main enclosure, allowed the quick spread of disease, and resulted in mass death. At this point, we can absolutely point to the situation as one created by the Nazi regime, and in part driven by the total disregard for those held within the camp. Belsen was not an extermination camp, but it was by that point not one where a productive workforce was being press-ganged, and their death by untreated disease was of no real concern. There is some irony, perhaps, in that near the end Himmler did order the epidemic to be combatted, in the vain belief he could use the camp inmates as a chip to deal with the Western Allies, but by then of course, things had spiraled far beyond control anyways. The prime example though, and perhaps alternatively closest to what you have in mind, is not the situation in the camps, but the situation in the closed off ghettos to which the Nazi regime forced Jewish persons to congregate in in the East prior to the establishment of the extermination camps. Similar to the situation in Belsen, the ghettos generally saw these spaces quickly filled up far beyond capacity, all Jewish families of an area now concentrated into a space which before had likely housed only a fraction of them. The cramped space, the overtaxed sanitation systems, the rudimentary support provided by outside authorities all but ensured outbreaks of disease - which of course then only confirmed the racial pseudoscience of the Nazis which believed Jews were dirty and prone to disease. This had been part of the public justification for forced ghettoization in the first place, even, and perhaps comes closest to what you were envisioning about causing mass death by disease. A declaration in 1940 supporting the ghettoization, by the Generalgovernment\\'s head health official, noted: The Jews are overwhelmingly the carriers and disseminators of infection. Spotted fever endures most persistently in the regions heavily populated by Jews with their low cultural level, their uncleanliness and infestation of lice unavoidably connected with this. ... There are only two ways to deal with them. We sentence the Jews in the ghetto to death by hunger or we shoot them, even if in the end the result is the same, the latter is more intimidating, we have one and only one responsibility, that the German people are not infected and endangered by these parasites, for that any means must be right. And while strictly speaking, \"let\\'s put them all here so they die of disease\" wasn\\'t in the absolute literal sense \\'the plan\\', the Nazis were often quite happy with the results, Hans Michael Frank, Governor General of Poland, happily remarking in 1943 how the terrible conditions of the ghetto was helping to deal with the Jewish population \\'naturally\\'. A number of outbreaks occurred, although it should also be stressed that despite the dire circumstances they were forced to work in, the Jewish health professionals in the ghetto did their damndest to fight back, often with marked success, although often they had to fight not only the diseases themselves, but also the active interference of the Germans who prevented their receipt of essential tools. Doctors in the Warsaw ghetto, for instance, were denied anti-typhus serum deliveries, and even saw the Germans quite literally steal their medical supplies in the middle of an outbreak. While both the Lodz and Warsaw ghetto suffered notable, extensive, outbreaks, the Vilna ghetto developed a particularly effective system of containment, so it wasn\\'t always a fight without victories, but even then, disease was never truly defeated. This isn\\'t to say German authorities had no concerns either. They might not have cared little for the humanity of the Jews in the ghetto, but generally they didn\\'t desire large scale-outbreaks either. But unlike the Jewish doctors and nurses, they often could be brutal in their methods of containment, and often chose methods that for all their brutality were ineffective anyways, implementing harsh, but ineffective disinfection routines, and requiring complete, isolated quarantine of over 6 weeks for a house with an outbreak, despite 2 being quite adequate. Further more, as in the camps, typhus infections would at times be dealt with through straight up murder. In the Kovno ghetto, for instance, a supposed outbreak of typhus resulted in the burning of the hospital... with patients and medical personnel still inside. As Baumslag aptly sums it up, \"the German methods of fighting infectious diseases were well known and feared more than epidemics\" and the result of course was incentive to hide infections. Although it was well known that lice caused typhus, German solutions mostly focused on the infected persons, and did little to attack the origin of the outbreaks. Now, I have written quite a lot here to address the premise of your question, but not really what you asked, but the two are quite related. The takeaway, I hope, at this point is that even if the Nazis were not effective about it, nor doing so out of concern for the humanity of the prisoners, they did make at least some attempts to contain disease in the camps, although at the same time it should certainly not be said that they particularly cared about their failures, especially seeing as large-scale killing was one \\'solution\\' they pursued. And lest we consider for a moment more effective control wasn\\'t possible, upon liberation of Bergen-Belsen, the British were able to report that there were no new typhus infections within two weeks of implementing their delousing program, although a number of prisoners, far to weakened and already infected, did pass away following their liberation. 1 / 2 ...',\n",

       " 'While we can\\'t prove that a \"proto-human language existed, there is enough evidence supporting this hypothesis-- such as hyperconserved words to drive ongoing research into a possible first human language. Researchers have use (and continue to use) a variety of methods to try to identify 1) when humans spoke this first language, and 2) what that language might have been like. For a well-written and accessible overview of the subject, I\\'d recommend the book The First Word by Christine Kenneally. The estimates for when humans all spoke a shared language vary: studies of phenome diversity over time give an estimate between 150,000-350,000 years ago which is largely consistent with estimates that have existed since the theory of language monogenesis appeared in Western academia in 1905. For context, this places a universal human language around the same time as the first archaeological evidence of Homo sapiens as a distinct species. However, some researches-- such as anthropologist Dr. Richard Klein-- believe this may have been as recent as 50,000 years ago. This would be right around the emergence of \"behaviorally modern humans. A 2011 study posited that this language would have had a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order (this is still the most prevalent word order, with 45% of the world\\'s languages being structured this way). SOV languages also show other similarities in word order. Studies of phenome diversity modern African languages (see above) support the idea that this proto--human language would have had a complex and varied set of consonants, likely including clicks.

       " 'The pyramids of Cairo and the Coliseum of Rome remain part of inhabited metropolitan areas to this day, but certainly there are other large structures and extensive inhabited areas that were abandoned and \"lost\". The closest I can give to a single answer is that human civilizations are not stable over periods of millennia, and a place that was once considered a major center of the world can become a backwater or a ruin in less time than you might think. Very few societies manage to keep the kind of long-lived continuity that ancient Rome or ancient Egypt used to (mostly justifiably) claim. For other major societies, which often seem to their citizens to be permanent fixtures of the world, the end can come sooner than you think, especially when you zoom out to a historical time scale. For example, every corner of the world in the late twentieth century was heavily influenced by the two superpowers. But the Soviet Union had arisen mere decades earlier from an unimportant backwater on the fringes of Europe, and would end up splintering after surviving barely over 70 years. The United States, in the meantime, had only been founded ~200 years earlier, and famous cities like Chicago and Los Angeles had grown to global importance over the course of a human lifespan. These are not long time spans from an archaeologist\\'s perspective. And the volatile twentieth century may be an outlier, but it\\'s not a complete exception: the Incan empire was enormous and incredible for its time, and it lasted (if I remember correctly) something like 90 years before the conquistadors destroyed it. So what about specific causes, if we can try and generalize to a few points? Wars and political events shift the center of power in a region, if not raze cities and drive out the inhabitants outright. Natural events (disease, volcanic eruption, earthquake) can suddenly make a place dangerous to inhabit, or weaken it enough to give its rivals an opportunity to grow in influence. Trade routes can rise or fall in importance due to economic or technological shifts, or because of other changes happening around distant trading partners. Less predictable effects can stem from cultural shifts as well. When power is concentrated, idiosyncracies of rulership can create sudden changes: for example, the pharoah Amenhotep IV attempted to replace all of Egypt\\'s religion with monotheistic worship of the sun god Aten, and had the city of Akhetaten built as the state\\'s new capital. These extreme changes did not outlast his death, and Akhetaten—now a reminder of a strange, heretical aberration in Egypt\\'s history—was abandoned quickly. In the Yucatan peninsula, where the complex city-polities that we call \"the Maya\" once ruled, there\\'s a complex archaeological record of cities rising or falling in prominence due to wars and political struggles, but also perhaps to religious shifts and one pilgrimage site becoming more important than an earlier one (not that such changes are totally distinct from politics and war themselves). Finally, I\\'d say that some places are \"lost\" in different ways than others. Early European archaeologists in the 19th century had a habit of crediting themselves with earth-shattering discoveries, but that doesn\\'t mean they were amazing scholars who pieced together a puzzle of clues like Indiana Jones. A given abandoned temple may well have been a familiar local landmark to the people living near it, even if its cultural significance may have been lost, and the wealthy European may have done no more than ask where the cool old buildings were and announce their discovery back in their home country. To be fair, they may have done some actual work analyzing or interpreting what they saw, some more cleverly than others, but if you\\'re wondering how something that large could be truly \"lost\"—sometimes, the answer is that it wasn\\'t.',\n",

       " \"You might be interested in this conversation I had with a now-deleted user. I'll refer specifically to the answer I wrote. An important issue Chechnya faced was that it technically did not win independence under the Khasavyurt Accord of 1996 or the peace treaty the following year. These agreements largely recognized the de facto situation on the ground until 2001, but Chechnya was far from receiving official recognition as an independent republic. The internal situation of the republic, furthermore, was getting worse, not better, as rival armed groups clashed with each other and with the republic's government. Arguably one of the biggest industries in Chechnya at the time was kidnapping for ransom. In any case, this lack of internal stability eventually spilled over Chechnya's borders when the Islamist warlord Shamil Basayev invaded neighboring Dagestan in order to spark a separatist rebellion there on August 7, 1999 (two days before Putin became Prime Minister). The situation resulted in an escalating armed conflict that included bombings in Dagestan, southern Russia, and Moscow itself. When taken altogether: clearly the Republic of Chechnya wasn't in control of the armed forces based there, who had already started a new war with the Russian state that was rapidly escalating in intensity, and involving bombings of soft targets. It's important to understand the timeline because while Russian security forces did do some questionable things around the Ryazan incident and the Moscow apartment bombings - they at the very least destroyed evidence before proper investigations could be carried out - it's still far from Yeltsin and Putin orchestrating false flag incidents out of the blue in peacetime to start a war for political gain.\",\n",
       " 'I am going to answer this part by part from your subquestions rather than one chronological narrative, though if requested, I can always do that as well, and if some specific follow-up question would arise. The relations between Serbia and Austro-Hungarian Empire was notoriously hostile, specially so after unilateral annexation of Bosnia ( which per Berlin treaty was under its occupation, but not de facto part of its Empire ), without notifying either Serbia or the Ottomans, and only notifying Russia a week prior to it, but then diplomatically outmaneuvering, and consequently damaging those relations as well. They eventually paid the Ottomans off, but all the other hostilities and resentment remained. After the Serbian victory in the second Balkan war, the relations took another hit, with Austria securing their Balkan interests. Gavrilo Princip was a Bosnian Serb, seeking independence for Yugoslav nations from Austria, so the term might not be that accurate. Overall, the Bosnian Youth movements ( later called Mlada Bosna ) were diverse, student-based from catholic Croats, muslim Bosnians and orthodox Serbs, among others. I am incredibly confused as to whether or not Serbia was part of Austria-Hungary Serbia was autonomous since 1830, independent since 1867-76 ( depending on conditions ), internationally 1878, proclaimed kingdom in 1882. and if not why and how the Austria-Hungarian crown prince could have been killed in Serbia if it was not part of the empire Namely, it was not in Serbia, but Bosnia, Sarajevo, where the Archduke was killed, was occupied by Austria-Hungary since the Berlin treaty, and part of of the Empire since 1908.',\n",
       " 'Just a point of order, how do you define \"Eurocentric?\" There is no question that some Northwestern European economies industrialized before anyone else. The debate, if there is one, exists around comparing and measuring non (or pre-) industrial economic activity. The difficulty in this measurement is that pre-industrial economic activity is fundamentally a function of agricultural productivity, however the \"successful\" or \"optimal\" distribution of economic prosperity even in agriculturally prosperous societies is a gigantic black hole. If you would like to read a universally-accepted summary of the drivers behind economic divergence, \"Understanding the Process of Economic Change,\" by Douglass North is a good place to start. Douglass North is a Nobel-prize winning economic historian, and pretty much all of his books espouse generally accepted theories of economic development (although the farther back you go, the more dated the notions espoused will become). If by \"Eurocentric\" you instead mean that you are exclusively interested in the origins of European Economic development, a book that might answer some of your questions is \"The First Modern Economy\" by Jan De Vries.',\n",

And of course individual Native people all have their preferences. There really is not a “one-size-fits-all” term to use for all contexts. It should be noted, however, that “American Indian” and “Native American” do have political associations in the United States, whereas the term “Indigenous” does not. Being American Indian or Native American often is associated with tribal citizenship status. Those terms are not limited to political connotations, but it is good to be aware of them. The term “Indigenous” is more general in a sense. It can be used to refer to original inhabitants internationally as well. In historical indigenous scholarship, the term the historian chooses to use is usually accompanied by a footnote that explains the choice of using that particular label. So, don’t feel like there is one right word and the rest are insensitive. The best way to navigate the terminology is to listen to the people in which they refer to. In conversation with a Native person? Ask them which term they prefer. Writing a paper about a particular tribe, Native person, or etcetera? Research how the tribe/person refers to themself or find out how relevant scholarship has referred to them. It’s complicated and each term is certainly nuanced. So, use the term that best fits the context in which you are using it.',\n",
       " 'To begin, the claim that that Thebes was the most populous city in the world at the time of Akhenaten must be questioned. Very little of ancient Thebes has been excavated since it lies rather inconveniently beneath modern Luxor, and excavations have focused on Karnak, Luxor temple, and the tombs and mortuary temples of the Theban west bank. We can say virtually nothing about the houses of the inhabitants of Thebes, and any population estimates are at best mildly informed guesses. Additionally, we shouldn\\'t speak of Thebes or Amarna as \"the\" capital of Egypt. In the 18th Dynasty, we can speak of two capitals – Memphis in the north and Thebes in the south. The vizierate was split into two from the reign of Thutmose III (14th century BCE) onward, with the vizier of Lower Egypt residing in Memphis and the vizier of Upper Egypt residing in Thebes. The nature of the relationship between Memphis and Thebes remains unclear, but it seems that we can classify Memphis as the administrative capital of Egypt and Thebes as the civil capital, which housed the king and his court at nearby palatial sites like Deir el-Ballas and Malqata. Memphis remained occupied throughout the Amarna period, and it remained under the supervision of the vizier of Lower Egypt. Additionally, we know of a temple to the Aten that was built in Memphis (pr itn mn-nfr, \"The House of the Aten of Mennefer\"). Of Thebes in the Amarna period, we can say relatively little. It is unlikely that it was abandoned entirely, but the temples and tombs in the Theban area reveal very little about the Amarna period. Nigel Strudwick\\'s Thebes in Egypt goes so far as to claim that \"activity in Thebes dropped to almost zero\" during the Amarna period. The house of Nakht, the vizier of Upper Egypt, has been located in Amarna, as have the houses of other notable officials, and it seems that the bulk of the administration of Thebes was relocated to Amarna. On the other hand, the dowager queen Tiye seems to have remained in residence at Malqata, suggesting that Thebes still housed at least a small remnant of the royal court. Queen Tiye is virtually absent from reliefs and tomb scenes from Amarna with the notable exception of the tomb of Huya, where she is shown visiting Amarna as part of the festivities in Year 12 of Akhenaten\\'s reign. It has been suggested that it was at this time that Nefertiti ascended to the throne as co-regent, but this has not yet been proven. The large population shift from Thebes to Amarna was not that unusual for the time, and Amarna was only one of several new capital cities constructed in the 14th and 13th centuries BCE. The first ruler of the Late Bronze Age to establish a major new capital was King Kurigalzu I of Babylonia, who built Dur-Kurigalzu (\"Fortress of Kurigalzu\") as the new administrative capital of Babylonia, though the city of Babylon continued to serve as the chief religious center. Dur-Kurigalzu was briefly excavated by a British team in the 1940s, but the vast majority of the site remains unexcavated. King Tukulti-Nunurta I of Assyria, who reigned after the time of Akhenaten, established a new capital at Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta (\"Quay of Tukulti-Ninurta\"). Like Babylon, the city of Aššur remained the religious center of Assyria and outlived Tukulti-Ninurta\\'s impressive but short-lived capital city. In Anatolia, the Hittite king Muwatalli II abandoned the capital of Ḫattuša in favor of the new capital city of Tarḫuntašša. This city has remained frustratingly elusive, but it seems to have been located somewhere in the Konya Plain. Muwatalli\\'s son and successor returned the royal court to Ḫattuša, abandoning Tarḫuntašša, which became the seat of a cadet branch of the royal family that grew to rival the courts of Ḫattuša and Carchemish in power and prestige. Finally, the Elamite king Untaš-Napiriša established the city of Al-Untaš-Napiriša, more commonly known today as Chogha Zanbil. This new capital city was intended to be an alternative to (if not replacement of) Susa, but the city was never finished and was abandoned shortly after the death of Untaš-Napiriša. As for the logistics of the move from Thebes to Amarna, the Egyptians had perfected the art of mass deportations and resettlement through a long history of warfare and raiding in the Levant, as had their contemporaries like the Hittites. The description of the battle of Megiddo from the reign of Thutmose III, for examples, notes that the Egyptians transported 3400 prisoners, 2041 horses, 191 foals, 924 chariots, 1929 cows, 2000 goats, 20,500 sheep, and so on from Megiddo in Israel back to Egypt – a much more difficult trek than sailing up or down the Nile.',\n",

In modern archaeology, it\\'s used to refer to the dominant power in the region that existed between the fall of Teotihuacan and the rise of the Aztec Triple Alliance, roughly between the 7th and 12th Centuries AD. Given how the stated timing of his birth, Ce Acatl would have been alive in the 10th Century, if he is a historical figure as well as a legendary one. This puts his reign in the middle of the archaeological Toltec period and more than 1400 years after the end of the Olmec period in the coastal lowlands to the east.',\n",
       " \"To a certain extent. Contested landings weren't especially common historically although there are some examples of raids on forts and the like which it did occur. Usually if you wanted to get an army ashore your ships could move along the coast faster than a full sized army with all their baggage train and artillery could move on land meaning it was hard for an army to effectively intercept you. meanwhile the Atlantic wall was some pretty special in history in its vast size, prior to the 20th century and the industrial capacity that was being brought to bare in that age the ability to construct defences so extensive that they could cover every part of the coast as oppose to defending key locations along it was a difficult task to achieve beyond a very short location of important coast where perhaps a naturally cliffy coastline helped to reduce the number of viable landing areas. So an invading army could usually find somewhere undefended to get at least a foothold ashore without having to land under fire although that isn't always true. And the logistics and casualties involved in such a landing meant that usually if a commander could avoid it they would. So if necessary you'd have an army land somewhere undefended them march overland to take somewhere more extensive landing of supplies and equipment could take place if that was necessary. That's not to say this kind of thing never happened but usually it was in the context of a raid, something going wrong or someone rolling the dice to try something unexpected. But where it did happen there was some preparations that where sometimes used. The landing vessels themselves were relatively simple, usually they were just relatively large rowing boats, sometimes they would be simply the normal ship's boats reused for the purpose and sometimes they'd make some specifically for the purpose which maybe designed to carry more passengers that weren't rowing. Sometimes they were given things like swivel guns, very small cannons on a pintle mount that could be loaded with something like a small ball shot, grape or canister that could be used to fire at targets on shore as the vessel was coming in. But beyond that they weren't particularly specialised. For the artillery often they could rely simply on the normal cannons aboard warships. A large enough fleet could bring some serious fire power to bare if they anchored up their broadsides to face the enemy and with some good gunnery and enough guns they could suppress shore batteries potentially. But if you only had smaller vessels and/or less of them on hand an enemy shore battery presented a serious threat, they could well have larger guns than all but the largest ships of the line meaning they could well out range and hit hard against something like a frigate. They could more safely use things like heated shot, placing cannon balls in fires to heat them till they where glowing hot and fire them out to start fires which would be risky for a ship to do and less likely to have as much effect being fired at a fort than the other way around. The gunners on a shore battery would have a more stable platform to fire from making their job a fair bit easier. Finally well designed fort would be able to take a fair bit more punishment with a lower risk to the gunners than a ship could take punishment without much risk. As part of suppressing such shore batteries some more specalist vessels where created for the purpose. These where vessels with powerful siege mortars mounted on their decks. This had been historically a difficult thing to make given that most cannons can be allowed to recoil on their tackles blunting the force of the recoil on the ship itself but a mortar's high angle of fire means the force of the recoil has to be directly taken by the deck itself. But specialised vessels strong enough for that task were constructed. This high angle of fire and the explosive or incendiary rounds they used as opposed to the balls of a normal cannon allowed them to drop their shells onto enemy defenders, and shore batteries and forts in particular, allowing the attackers to attempt to drive the enemy back from defending too close to the landing beaches and killing or suppressing the fire from enemy cannons.\",\n",
       " 'Greetings! This is a most interesting question that you have posed, and it does crossover into the whole philosophy of history a bit (though perhaps that was not your intention in asking it). To give an overview of my tuppence on the matter, this response will consist of two parts: the first will address the \"misconceptions\" presented in the question, as well as perhaps some fresh perspective, and the second will deal with the actual historiography of the \"seminal tragedy\" itself. Let\\'s begin. Judging 1914 \"Europe is to be the scene of the most terrible war that she has witnessed since the fall of the Roman Empire.\" - The London Times just before the outbreak of war. The concept of \"stupidity\" in the First World War, as the question puts before us, is an odd one indeed. Forgive me if I sound a tad too direct or fired up in these coming sentences, but I would argue that the following statement: And then there\\'s the whole stupid way the war started. I\\'ve always hated studying WW1 because it\\'s just stupidity start to finish. Is egregiously and dangerously \"anti-historical\". On the first count, reducing an entire event (especially one with such impact on the world even today) to a single, fairly insulting, descriptor, is in of itself ridiculously dim. I do not fault you for believing that the First World War was \"stupid\", but I implore you (and everyone else) to realise that perhaps such judgement is too dismissive of the historical circumstances and nuances which led Europe to catastrophe in 1914. The war did not simply start over the assassination of some archduke. Its causes remain a highly debate historiographical topic even today, and all manner of responses have been written on this sub about all manner of possible factors which led to the Great War. I will not go too in-depth on this debate, but feel free to ask any follow-ups on this most pertinent matter. What I will instead point out is that if you believe the start of the First World War is stupid, then I would bet a fair bit you believe that the start of the Second one was utter nonsense. It is one thing to ascribe a descriptor to the actions of an individual, it is another to apply that same descriptor to the complex web of actions and decisions undertaken by an entire continent. Not only are we possibly falling for this trap in asking such a question, but we are falling into another one: judging the past by the standards of today. To us, it seems entirely illogical and dim that an assassination of some high-ranking individual form the casus belli of an entire continent-wide conflict. Europe however, was no stranger to war even in 1914, and underlying the assassination was a system of alliances, national interests, geopolitical rivalries and old tensions going back decades. A necessity to studying history, I argue, is that you approach it with an open mind. If you, for example, already have the fixed notion that the First World War is \"stupidity from start to finish\", then you will most likely frame every single bit of information about it in that light. With regards to that argument, I would happily vouch that Scott Anderson had his own agenda when writing that chapter on \"Imperial Folly\" (ignoring for even a brief moment that such sweeping claims might not have been appropriate for the focus of his work), which of course makes him highlight all the follies and blunders of the Anglo-French forces during the War. To wrap-up this longer preamble/section before moving on to the actual historiography of the First World War, I would like to simply ask that we consider the possibility of the First World War not being a war of stupid mistakes in decision-making and their subsequent consequences, but rather a tragic outcome of the dominoes falling when they were otherwise at their most stable. All subsequent decisions were of course, products of their own historical precedents and circumstances. A New Age of War La guerre! C’est une chose trop grave pour la confier à des militaires. War is too serious a matter to entrust to military men. - French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, quoted in Soixante Anneés d\\'Histoire Française by Georges Suarez. Turning to the first points you have mentioned from the \"Imperial Folly\" chapter: When he describes the dominant pattern of \"throwing your forces at the strongest defended point\", i.e. the cult of the offensive, the whole general stupidity of trench warfare, the German \"invade France super fast\" plans involved troops moving faster than their supply train, both times, At the outbreak of war in August 1914, none of the European great powers save Russia had been involved in a major war for 43 years. There had been regional wars limited to two or three powers, namely the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71 and the Balkan Wars in 1912-13. Despite this lull in conflicts, the technological advancements of the 19th century had reshaped the face of warfare, yet few if none of the generals who took command in 1914 had a full grasp of that \"revolution in firepower\" as David Stevenson calls it. Gone were the inefficient single-shot muskets and cannons of Napoleon\\'s campaigns, gone were the days when an army\\'s size dictated how much firepower it could put out in a single salvo, and gone were the days when supply trains consisted of horse-drawn wagons. The weapons of 1815 had been replaced by the bolt-action rifle, machine gun, and breech-loading artillery. The size of an army now mattered little in the face of such deadly arsenals, or on the presence of fortifications. Supplies and men now travelled far faster by rail or lorry. This new style of warfare had been written about by 1914, but it had not become standard reading for new officers or high-ranking commanders. In short, the \"cult of the offensive\" remained the main tactic of the generals because there had been no time to devise a more suitable alternative. What eventually became the horrific war of attrition started out in 1914-15 as genuine attempts to rout an enemy or capture a key position. It is testament to the fact that Napoleon\\'s tactics were still valid when armies were caught in wide-open battlefields, where the offensive truly mattered. Erich von Falkenhayn on the Eastern front, General Allenby in the Middle East, and Lettow-Vorbeck in East Africa are just some examples of successful commanders who embodied (at times) what had made Napoleon\\'s campaigns the envy of all Europe. Yet curiously, the horrid reputation of trench warfare\" is a paradox we must consider for a moment. Whilst these battles of open manuever and defense in the first few stages of the war perhaps saw the most success, they were also the costliest. Stevenson brings up the example of the 23rd of August, 1914 for the French Army, in which 27,000 soldiers were killed in one day. The establishment of the trenches, no matter how horrid and terrible they would later become, was at least a respite from the dangers of being in the open in an age of artillery and machine guns. I highly recommend reading some memoirs from the war (especially the earlier years), where a common theme actually is that soldiers feel safer in the trenches. The eventual back-and-forth of trench warfare may itself seem stupid, it is perhaps the very definition of insanity, but there was a certain logic to it. In the stalemate which became the status quo for much of the war, neither side was able to push the other back decisively. To that end, generals began realising that the only way to achieve victory was to force a war of attrition which the opposing side could not hope to win, eventually causing them to abandon a position or risk losing unacceptably high numbers of men again and again. It is a horrific assessment, but it was one which fitted the realist tactician of the trenches. So to end this part of the response: the generals of the First World War, no matter how much bungling and stupidity historians have ascribed to them, were the uninitiated top brass in an era of warfare which had not been tested in-depth until 1914 (and presented a learning curve which took almost an entire war to surmount) . No matter how repugnant the idea of attritional warfare was, it served as the best option to break the deadlock which had developed. Thus no matter how irresistible the word \"stupid\" is to describe the combat of the First World War, I submit that the word \"unfortunate\" is a better one. But let us not forget that behind the military blunders lay the political ones, and that is where we are headed next in this exploration.',\n",
       " 'Part 2: The Politics of War In the last bit I touched on the military circumstances surrounding the horrors of trench warfare and how the First World War was a massive and bloody learning curve for all sides in a new age of warfare. In this section I shall briefly go over the political arena during 1914 and up until the American involvement in 1918. Let\\'s begin. Note: some parts of this response have been adapted from earlier questions I have answered on the sub, they are linked in the \"Sources\" section for reference. Similar sources from yesterday\\'s comment were used, and any new ones are cited. The problem of the First World War in diplomatic terms is that it was rarely ever the case that countries were united on the same matter. Even within the Entente and Central Powers, there was disagreement as to which nation should act in which way over which matter. You mentioned Anderson\\'s focus on the Gallipoli Campaign, and the French insistence on gaining control of Syria at the end of the war. I would like to focus therefore on these two areas of blunders, and explain the more \"hidden\" side behind the decisions. In acknowledging the \"stupidity\" of the French and British venture in the Middle East, we are ignoring the key consideration (or two considerations at this point) which cast a shadow over the Great War in general: imperialism. The idea of Empire remained a pertinent one in Europe at the time, and it is therefore no wonder that the two largest imperial powers of the time sought to wrest control from a longstanding \\'Eastern\\' counterpart: The Ottoman Empire. The \"sick man of Europe\" as it was known was crumbling, and the First World War was an opportunity for France and Britain to advance their imperialist agendas on the Arabian Peninsula. This was coupled with the Royal Navy\\'s desire for that increasingly precious \"black gold\": oil (specifically in this case the refineries at the head of the Persian Gulf). Thus at the time, invading the Ottomans by forcing a campaign directly through the Dardanelles seemed a logical option. In 1915 however, it was actually the Russians who requested that the Anglo-French forces launch a \"demonstration\" against Constantinople to relieve the Russian troops in the Caucasus (where the Ottomans had maintained a significant military presence since late 1914 and kept up the pressure with bloody but constant offensives). In London there was significant support for the (rather logical) decision to launch the Dardanelles Offensive. First Sea Lord Winston Churchill was backed by that giant of imperial conquest: Lord Herbert Kitchener (who at the time was Secretary of State for War, and thus possessed considerable influence). Michael Howard best sums up the arguments for a conquest of Constantinople: \"For one thing, it would reopen communications with Russia, freeing her to export the grain that played so vital a part in her economy. For another, a \\'back door\\' could be opened through the Balkans to help the Serbs, who were still successfully resisting Austrian attack; and the Serb\\'s former allies of the Balkan Wars, Bulgaria and Greece, might be persuaded to come to her help as well.\" The naval venture however, turned into the shambles that it was due to a mix of unfortunate military blunders and political oversight. The officials in Whitehall had given ambiguous orders to the task force deployed to the Dardanelles, and the presence of Ottoman minefields in the strait posed massive problems to the Royal Navy and French Navy. The resulting slaughter on the cliffs of Gallipoli was the result of these naval forces calling for land support, and by the end of 1915 the evacuation of the ANZAC-French force (who fought admirably and remain honoured to this day, alongside their Ottoman-Turkish counterparts) was the only thing the Entente salvaged from the operation. I will not go too in-depth on the minutia of Allied failure and the reasons why they maintained the offensive for months, but further reading is recommended on this area. The injustice done to the Arabs at the Paris Peace Conference is deserving of its own question on the sub, as the details of that question still haunt our world (geographically and politically) today. What I will say here and now to end this duo of responses is that the political mistakes of the First World War seem like mistakes to us now, when at the time of their enactment they were fairly rational decisions influenced by war aims, imperial sentiments, and overarching precedents. I hope you found this thread a bit helpful, and let me know if you have any follow-ups!

       " \"Seems like a propaganda piece of the stabbed in the back myth. In the time leading up to the end of the first world war German propaganda had been continuously downplaying how bad a state of affairs the German war effort was in and since the start of the war making the enemy seem weak and pathetic had often featured in propaganda. As a result many Germans found it hard to understand how they'd lost the war given how much they'd been told they were winning it. In reality Germany was defeated militarily with their last throw of the dice for victory in the 1918 spring offensive failing, their allies collapsing, their economy on the brink and finally the Hindenburg line which they had been relying on to prevent a total defeat being breached during the 100 day offensive. But that wasn't the picture most of the German public was given while much of the high command of the German army worked to attempt to shift the blame off themselves for their failings. And so there came the stabbed in the back myth. The idea that the German army had won the war but cowardly bankers, politicians and importantly for the long term often Jews had surrendered Germany up. This idea attempting to save the pride of the German people by attempting to explain why they hadn't really lost the war also contributed to their perspectives on the treaty of Versailles. The treaty was always a harsh one but for Germans that couldn't understand that they had really lost the war it seemed doubly unfair given that such humiliating harsh treaties where supposed to be for people who'd lost the war like say..... the one they'd given to the Russians.\",\n",
       " 'It\\'s because at the time the British monarchy did claim the French throne, based on old claims going back to the time of the Hundred Years\\' War. English and later British monarchs pressed that claim until the French Revolution, when the French monarchy was overthrown and abolished. They dropped the claim in 1800, after the Act of Union of that year united the crowns of the Kingdom of Great Britain with the Kingdom of Ireland, and formally recognized the French Republic in the treaty of Amiens in 1802. After the Bourbon Restoration, the British monarchs did not again pursue their claims in France, and the French monarchy was eventually abolished for the last time in 1848. I have an older answer which includes the royal styles, which I\\'ll copy and paste below: The only time a British monarch was also titled Emperor was the period of time between 1876-1948, when the British monarchs were titled as Emperor/Empress of India. The title \"emperor\" in English usually refers to someone ruling over a multicultural, well, empire: a nation-state that is comprised of people of many nationalities and languages. Queen Victoria was the first to be styled Empress, and her full style and title at her death was: \"Her Majesty Victoria, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland Queen, Defender of the Faith, Empress of India.\" I hate to post stuff from Wiki (bad form from a moderator) but rather than retyping them all, I\\'ll copypasta the titles and styles of monarchs and how they changed over time (EDIT: I should mention that these date from 1707 because of the Act of Union of that year, when Scotland and England united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain.). Years | Style | Monarch ---|---|---- 1707–1714|By the Grace of God, Queen of Great Britain, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.|Anne 1714–1801|By the Grace of God, King of Great Britain, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, Archtreasurer and Prince-Elector of the Holy Roman Empire, Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg|George I, George II, George III 1801–1814|By the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland King, Defender of the Faith, Arch-treasurer and Prince-Elector of the Holy Roman Empire, Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg|George III 1814–1837|By the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland King, Defender of the Faith, King of Hanover, Duke of Brunswick|George III, George IV, William IV 1837–1876|By the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland Queen, Defender of the Faith|Victoria 1876–1901|By the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland Queen, Defender of the Faith, Empress of India|Victoria 1901–1927|By the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India|Edward VII, George V 1927–1948|By the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India|George V, Edward VIII, George VI 1948–1952|By the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith|George VI 1952–1953|By the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas Queen, Defender of the Faith|Elizabeth II (before coronation) From 1953|By the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith|Elizabeth II So you can see that the first monarch to take the title of \" of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas King\" was Edward VII. This reflects the \"Dominion status\" of Canada and Australia, and was carried forward until Elizabeth II\\'s coronation, when her title/style changed to reflect the Commonwealth nations. Edit the Second, by the grace of God the last: the reason for the title Empress of India was because of the political reorganization in India after the rebellion of 1857, when the old British East India holdings were incorporated into Britain. The title was awarded to Victoria by an act of Parliament in 1876, and the title Emperor/Empress was held by British monarchs until Indian independence, in 1948.',\n",
       " 'The referenced older answers by u/ancienthistory and u/itsallfolklore provide excellent overviews of some of the methodological pitfalls of comparative monster studies. I\\'d just like to point out that the difficulties of translating terms for mythical creatures aren\\'t purely a problem of modern culture/academia. Since these entities don\\'t have the same kind of obvious physical referentiality as, say, a horse, interpreters have to fall back on other points of linkage. The decision by Hellenistic translators to generally render Hebrew & Aramaic tannīn as Greek drákōn, for instance, may be connected to the narrative role these beings play in particular texts, as adversaries whose overthrow by a hero or divine figure points to the latter\\'s righteousness (the Book of Daniel is a good illustration here). This is in spite of the quite different etymologies of these terms--tannīn probably derives from a verb meaning \"to twist, stretch, coil like smoke?\" while drákōn seems to be from the verb \"to see,\" perhaps referencing the hypnotizing eyes of the monster. Much later, Islamic scholars used the Arabic tinnīn (a close cognate of tannīn) as an equivalent for the New Persian azhdahā, though the latter comes from an Avestan term meaning something like \"snake-man\" or \"barbarian-serpent.\" This connection seems to come from a perception that both were giant, serpentine creatures, even though (despite what you may read!) the azhdahā fulfills a pretty distinct cultural function in New Persian literature. Turning to the Chinese \"dragon,\" there\\'s a fascinating attestation of the diverse ways this creature was understood in premodern cultural spheres beyond East Asia. The Rasulid Hexaglot is a Yemeni text from the 14th century CE. As the title indicates, it indexes six languages--Arabic, Persian, a Turkic dialect, colloquial Greek, Armenian, and Mongol--in an extensive series of word-tables, grouped by subject matter. Not all entries include all six languages, but it\\'s still a fascinating insight into the art of medieval translation. In a segment on animals, there\\'s an entry that runs: Arabic al-timsāḥ Persian nahang Turkic ılan balıq Mongol lū. Al-timsāḥ is pretty straightforward; it means \"crocodile.\" Though medieval dictionaries often use nahang to translate al-timsāḥ, it really has a broader meaning referring to dangerous aquatic creatures/monsters that drag their victims down into the depths--sometimes crocodiles but also sharks, hippos, and more mythical beasties. In Modern Persian it actually means \"whale.\" Ilan balıq literally means \"snake fish\"; in Modern Turkish this seems to refer to eels, though I\\'m not aware of any broad medieval usage (I\\'m not by any means a Turkic specialist, though!) But lū (from what I understand--again, not a Mongolianist) is again pretty straightforward; it\\'s a borrowing from the Chinese lóng, the creature that Modern English usually calls the Chinese \"dragon.\" What seems to be going on here is an attempt to translate the years of the Chinese calendar. An adjacent entry translates Arabic \"the sheep\" into other languages as \"year of the sheep\" (generally \"Year of the Goat\" in English). And, as it turns out, Modern Persian continues to use \"nahang\" for the Chinese calendar\\'s \"Year of the Dragon,\" even though Modern Persian doesn\\'t make much if any other association between nahang (whales) and dragons (for which the standard translation is the term I give above, azhdahā.) All of which is just to illustrate that there is a millennia-long interest in trying to equate mythical beasts from different cultures, and that the specific equations made between, say, the lóng and the dragon, are highly dependent on specific contexts.',\n",
       " 'Your letters ... brought me the first information of the death of my antient friend Mazzei, which I learn with sincere regret. he had some peculiarities, & who of us has not? but he was of solid worth; honest, able, zealous in sound principles moral & political, constant in friendship, and punctual in all his undertakings. he was greatly esteemed in this country - Th Jefferson, 18 July 1816 Yes, I do think that he was interesting. The Florentine merchant and man of many talents became a citizen of the US and Poland through respective contributions to those nations. He helped secure financing for the Commonwealth of Virginia during the Revolution. He championed religious liberty and was an activist for it in Virginia. He wrote the first American perspective specifically for the European market of the Revolutionary War, published in French. He translated many of Jefferson\\'s speeches into Italian to spread them further. This is the tip of the iceberg as he had a tremendous amount of activity in his life. One thing was his love for horticulture. He was granted rights by Virginia\\'s Assembly to purchase land in Augusta County, Virginia when he relocated from London to the colony in 1773. Stopping in Charlottesville on the way, he spent a night at Monticello (before it\\'s current design, and still very much under construction) with his friend, Thomas Jefferson. Waking early the next morning, the two men took a hike and Mazzei was encouraged to look no further than Albemarle County for his new home. He had also learned the parcel in Augusta Co was actually parcels - that is, it was split into several smaller holdings instead of one. He didn\\'t need to see anymore and soon purchased a small holding from Jefferson just to the South of Monticello, adding several hundred more acres soon after and building his home, Colle. In 1778 he was sent abroad to gain financial support for purchasing arms by the State, and at this time the Convention Troops (the POWs from Saratoga) arrived in Charlottesville. Lieutenant General Friedrich Riedesel, commander of all German and Native forces on the Saratoga Campaign, would end up renting Colle for the next year or so. Along with him came his wife and their three daughters, and they actually built additions on Colle during this time. Before Mazzei and his family left for Europe and for a few weeks both the Mazzeis - Philip, his wife, and her daughter - and the 5 Riedesels were all at Colle. Also at Colle were the commanders horses, and Jefferson sums up where we are in the story in a quote; Mr. Mazzei was an Italian and brought over with him about a dozen laborers of his own country, bound to serve him 4. or 5. years. We made up a subscription for him of £2000. sterling, and he began his experiment on a peice of land adjoining to mine. His intention was, before the time of his people should expire, to import more from Italy. He planted a considerable vineyard, and attended to it with great diligence for three years. The war then came on. The time of his people soon expired; some of them enlisted, others chose to settle on other lands and labor for themselves; some were taken away by the gentlemen of the country for gardeners, so that there did not remain a single one with him, and the interruption of navigation prevented his importing others. In this state of the thing he was himself employed by the state of Virginia to go to Europe as their agent to do some particular business. He rented his place to General Riedesel, whose horses in one week destroyed the whole labour of three or four years, and thus ended an experiment, which, from every appearance, would in a year or two more have established the practicability of that branch of culture in America. - Jefferson, 25 Jan 1793 The troubled experiment was finished, his vines trampled by the war horses of a POW renting his home. The original Colle was disassembled and, according to local lore, was used in part to assemble Michie Tavern (a \"back in time\" lunch tavern located next to Monticello today) when it was moved in the 1930s. The original foundation was once more built upon, this time by Shirley and Stanley Woodward, Sr, who had purchased the property after their friend, General Pa Watson, had built his home, Kenwood, nearby. FDR would have a cottage at built at Kenwood as well and all of these buildings were designed and built by William Adams Delano, cousin to the president, and in the late 1930\\'s/early 40\\'s. That recreation of Colle still exists and may be rented as a vacation home. Directly across the street sits Jefferson Vinyards, established as Simeon in the 1980\\'s but renamed in the 1990\\'s in honor of both men and their efforts to establish a wine country over 200 years earlier in the same exact spot. That region now holds a massive amount of wineries and produces some of the finest wine on Earth, just as Mazzei had predicted. The Kenwood Campus, where the cottage of FDR and home of Gen Watson are located, is also the site of the Thomas Jefferson Library, which also houses a center for international studies. One of several special collection areas in the Library is named in honor of Mazzei, and there are several busts of him in the building. Congress has also recognized his contributions to the American cause, even crediting him with directly influencing Jefferson\\'s language in our Declaration of Independence. So yeah, he\\'s a pretty interesting guy with a lot of interesting experiences in his life. This obviously doesnt touch any of his foreign travels and honestly only touches on part of his life in Virginia. If you have a more specific question about his life I\\'d be happy to answer it. For more: Philip Mazzei: My Life and Wanderings compiled by Sister Margherita Marchione is full of detail from his own writings. She also published Vita Avventurosa Di Filippo Mazzei in a bilingual English/Italian format if you prefer to read it before translation.',\n",
       " 'Simply put, Britain didn’t have the power or influence in Ireland to bring them into the war and the Irish government was particularly anti-British compared to other Dominions The Long version: Just before the First World War, there was a movement in Ireland demanding Home Rule that was agreed to by Britain, but delayed in 1914 due to the start of the war. Because of the political situation, of which Home Rule was only part, the British Gov decided not to implement conscription in Ireland but did encourage the Irish Volunteers, a predecessor to the original IRA, to volunteer willingly to join the British army. The Irish Volunteers split as many went off to France, while some of the Volunteers who stayed in Ireland held an uprising in Dublin known as the 1916 Rising. There was a heavy-handed response to the Rising by the Brits with many of the leaders of the Rising executed, and this caused a shift away from Ireland demanding Home Rule to demanding full independence. Irish people who joined the British army during WW1 were also ostracised and shamed when they returned. My hometown didn’t put up a memorial to those who died until this year. Following the 1918 UK election (in which Sinn Fein, the Irish Nationalist party, won a majority in Ireland) the ‘Old’ IRA began a war of independence that lasted until 1922 with the signing of the Anglo-Irish treaty, granting the ‘Irish Free State’ dominion status (Northern Ireland remains part of the UK) as well as allowing Britain to keep a few naval bases, among other things. The Old IRA split again into the Pro-Treaty IRA, which became the Irish Army, and the Anti-Treaty IRA, who wanted to keep fighting for full independence and to reclaim the North. This started a civil war that lasted until 1923. In 1932 Eamonn De Valera, the original President of Ireland during the war of independence and the leader of the anti-treaty IRA during the civil war, was elected as the official leader of the Irish Free State. He pretty much immediately went to work stripping the Free-State constitution of any ties with Britain and tried to dislodge Ireland as a British subject. Part of this was starting a trade-war with Britain, and when that ended in 1938, Britain relinquished control of its ports in Ireland. By 1939 Britain had no military capacity in Ireland. The Irish Free State had also made a bit of an impact in international politics, with a key part of that being a commitment to neutrality. De Valera was leader of the League of Nations in the lead up to WW2 When WW2 broke out, Britain knew that they couldn’t force Ireland to join the war, and too much pressure to join would lead to possibly creating an enemy-friendly nation on their doorstep. Churchill offered De Valera Northern Ireland at one stage in return for Ireland joining the war, but De Valera refused as he didn’t think Churchill would fulfil his promise. In Ireland, WW2 is known as ‘The Emergency’. Although they remained neutral, they weren’t completely neutral. Ireland interned members of the IRA, who had links to Nazi Germany hoping to get guns and support for another rebellion. German pilots who landed in Ireland were interned as well (although there is an interesting story of a German spy who landed in the wrong place in full uniform, was given directions by the local police, and lived out the rest of the war outside Dublin), while Allied pilots were smuggled back to the UK. De Valera retained some political ties to Germany. Controversially, upon hearing of Hitlers suicide, De Valera sent the German ambassador a letter expressing his sympathies. TLDR: Ireland didn’t want to join the war and wouldn’t give in to pressure from Britain to join, and Britain had known they couldn’t force them to join since before 1914 Hope that answers your question in a sort of roundabout way!',\n",
       " 'Greetings! How fortuituous that I just finished a fairly comprehensive overview of the Wehrmacht (the German armed forces during World War 2) in this thread here (shameless plug there, worth a read if you are interested. Some of this response (mainly the bits about German troop sizes) has been taken from that as well, but I have added on some more specifics about the Polish opposition facing them. Let\\'s begin. Adapted from linked response: The Polish Army in September 1939 consisted of thirty regular infantry divisions, ten reserve divisions, eleven brigades of horsed cavalry and one armored brigade. Facing them from Germany and East Prussia were fifty-five German divisions. Twenty-four of them were infantry divisions in the so-called “first-wave”, regular soldiers and the best reservists. Fifteen were infantry of regular cadres and younger reservists, whilst the sixteen divisions were composed of six new Panzergruppen and ten fully mechanized infantry. Importantly however, the Germans had overwhelming superiority in the air, with over 2,000 modern aircraft crewed by well-trained Luftwaffe pilots decimating the 600 obsolete Polish aircraft. Unfortunately, my knowledge does not extend so far as to the general makeup or size of German vs. Polish divisions, so hopefully another contributor with past experience in this field can comment on the breakdown of what an actual infantry or panzer division consisted of. What I can do however, is offer a general overview of the actual tactics the Germans employed. The Wehrmacht plan for Poland was formed around two key \"army groups\". The first was Heeresgruppe Nord (Army Group North), under the command of Generaloberst (roughly the equivalent of a colonel-general) Fedor von Bock. Its 3rd Army was based in East Prussia, and its 4th Army in Eastern Pomerania. The 4th Army was to link up with the 3rd Army via the Danzig Corridor, and then both would attack along the line of the Vistula-Narew rivers, aiming for the capital of Warsaw. In the South, Heeresgruppe Sud (Army Group South) under the command of generaloberst Gerd von Rundstedt, was to advance through southern Poland towards Warsaw as well, encircling Polish resistance along the way. This task was entrusted to its 8th, 10th, and 14th Armies. The Wehrmacht were assisted in their task on the 17th of September, when the Red Army invaded Poland from the east. Two weeks into the campaign, and most of the Polish divisions had been encircled or fragmented into smaller forces. Pockets formed around the cities of Kutno, Radom, and Warsaw, with the capital itself falling on the 27th of September (though resistance did continue until as late as October 6th. With that, the Polish campaign came to a swift end, and the world was shocked at the sheer speed of the German advance. In the coming months, years, and decades, this speed would be attributed to a \"new\" form of warfare: Blitzkrieg (lightning war). I would like to note a few things here: Without going into too much of the debate, the essence of it all is that Blitzkrieg was not the concerted effort of mechanized troops and Panzers which is often pictured when hearing the word. Instead, Blitzkrieg (if one can even use the term) referred to the Germany Army’s preference for fast, and short campaigns, which during the Second World War was launched though the use of Panzergruppen and the Luftwaffe’s “Flying Artillery”. In truth, the German campaign in Poland was not spearheaded by the lightning-fast and precise Blitzkrieg strikes which is often detailed. Instead, the Panzers were deployed in a dispersed manner, aiming to overrun key communication points, supply lines, and defenses. I hope this response helps shed some light on your question, and feel free to ask any further follow-ups!

       " 'You\\'re right to suspect that there are some complicated layers of translation here, and that the creatures in the story may not always have been \"dragons\" in our modern understanding of the term. However, I\\'d caution against assuming that this tale refers to a historical event involving physical creatures of any kind. The earliest account appears some four hundred years after the confrontation at Dinas Emrys supposedly took place, and Merlinus doesn\\'t get involved until Geoffrey of Monmouth\\'s famous version, another three hundred years after that. The oldest version of the tale appears in the Historia Brittonum (“History of the Britains”), a Latin text written in northern Wales, probably 820’s, possibly by a monk named Nennius (though this last bit is controversial). The HB may have been composed as a British counter-narrative to Bede’s Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, which is about a century older and makes no mention of Vortigern encountering mythical creatures. All in all, the story that the HB tells here is fairly similar to Geoffrey’s better-known account, which makes sense--the HB was almost certainly one of Geoffrey’s principal sources. But there are some crucial differences. The prophetic child, for instance, is not Geoffrey’s Merlinus, but rather “Ambrosius.” The HB probably takes this name from Gildas’s De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae, in which Ambrosius is a valiant general of Roman descent who seemingly lived two or three generations before the writing of De Excidio. Gildas has nothing to say about Ambrosius’s childhood, other than that his parents were some sort of imperial or post-imperial officials (they “wore the purple”) and that they died in the upheavals of the post-Roman period. The HB explicitly makes Ambrosius’s father a consul--but only after the boy is designated as a sacrificially-potent child “born without a father,” which may indicate that the HB is mashing together a few different accounts here. And the creatures unearthed beneath the building site (here located at “Heremus,” somewhere in Gwynedd) are vermes—”worm,” “serpent,” and “vermin” are all possible translations. While the vermes don’t seem to be of extraordinary size, Ambrosius explains that they form part of a symbolic tableau. The pool they’re found in represents the world, the tent covering them represents Guorthigirn’s Vortigern’s kingdom, and the two vermes represent two dracones, which in turn are totems for the native Britons and the Saxon invaders. This triple analogy—vermes=dracones=gentes—is pretty unusual, and may again suggest that the HB is collapsing or synthesizing a few different stories. Geoffrey of Monmouth’s Historia Regum Brittaniae, completed sometime in the mid-1130’s, reworks older materials like the HB into a wild, prophetically-driven, and largely fantastical narrative. Though written in Latin, like the HB, its initial audience were not the Welsh but rather the Anglo-Norman nobility (though it was quickly adopted by the Welsh in the various receptions of Brut y Brenhinedd). While Geoffrey has plenty to say about the character he calls Aurelius Ambrosius--corresponding to Gildas’s Ambrosius Aurelianus and the HB’s Ambrosius—he transfers the tale of the prophetic child and the reptiles to a new character, Merlinus. (Though he does gesture to his sources, stating that Merlinus “was also called Ambrosius.”) Many aspects of Geoffrey’s Merlinus seems to derive from an entirely different character, Myrddin Wyllt (“Myrddin the Wild/Mad”), a legendary poet associated with the area around the modern Anglo-Scottish border. Other indications suggest that Myrddin Wyllt was believed to have lived in the late sixth century, nearly a hundred and fifty years after the time of Vortigern. But Geoffrey seems to have taken a particular interest in this character, and made him integral to a wide, ahistorical swathe of the British past. Geoffrey’s Merlinus is very much “born without a father”—he’s the child of an “incubos,” a part-human, part-angel spirit of the lower heavens that strives to mate with mortal women. And there’s nothing about vermes in the HRB—Geoffrey, never one to avoid the fantastic, makes the subterranean creatures explicitly dracones. (He also turns the boy’s one-sentence prediction from the HB into nine pages of baroque prophecy, which was often detached and treated as a separate work from the HRB as a whole). The third text that deserves a mention here is the Welsh Cyfranc Lludd a Llefelys (“Tale of Lludd and Llefelys”). This appears as a supplement in one of the Welsh translations of HRB that I referenced above, but it might contain elements of a supplemental tradition. Set in the ancient pre-Roman past, it provides a backstory for how exactly the two prophecy-creatures ended up in an underground pool in Gwynedd. In terms that may be an attempt to make sense of the HB’s confusing set of analogies, Lludd a Llefelys explains that the beasts are shape-changing dragons (dreigeu, a Welsh borrowing from Latin), who conduct aerial combat in the shape of aruthter aniueileit (“dreadful animals”) but, when tired, plummet back to earth as parchellod (“piglets”!). In this harmless/adorable form, they are finally trapped and buried on the future site of DInas Emrys. So yes—the forms of the creatures in this tale do shift around quite a bit. But even the earliest version is clearly legendary, and later accounts only get more fantastical from there. Also, just to note that wyrm is Old English, not the Celtic Brittonic language that some theoretical historical equivalent of Vortigern and Ambrosius would have spoken in addition to Latin. “Dragon” is Welsh is draig, with the Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru postulating a Brittonic form drakī; snake is neidr (no postulated Brittonic form from GPC, unfortunately, though there’s an Old Cornish form nader) or sarff (also from Latin, serpens). Ifor Williams thinks that the vermes of the HB are a translation from the Welsh pryf, which derives from the same Proto-Indo-European root as vermes/wyrm and means “vermin, little wild creature”--which may or may not explain the piglets of CLaL.',\n",
       " 'Note that dragons in ancient and early medieval art are often very serpent-like in form, and the words used for them in several languages (wyrm, drakon) also meant snake (or more specifically, big snake). Note also that in many legends, dragons were as likely to have a poisonous bite or breath as they were to breathe fire. So I think the question \"did they mean Dragon, or did they mean snake?\" is possibly not a distinction they would actually have made. What they were thinking of was probably in essence \"big, dangerous, snake-like monster, probably with magic powers\".',\n",
       " 'Hello, I wrote an answer here about trying to gauge the affordability of medieval meat. As that answer says in more detail, the problem for the peasantry (at least post-Conquest in England) wasn\\'t meat, but fresh meat. Animals were typically butchered for the winter on Martinmas, the 11th of November and without the luxury of hunting (at least openly), and barring the thinning out of old breeding stock in the spring, that meat then had to last several months. This meant that meat typically had to be preserved - whether dried, cured, smoked, pickled or salted - and rationed to last. Stews and pies were therefore a common means of ekeing out those meat supplies, as well as making preserved meat more palatable. Two sources I return to often for these questions are Ælfric\\'s Colloquy, a 10th Century Latin textbook in the format of a guide to a contemporary English community, and the 15th Century poem London Lickpenny, which paints a vivid picture of that city\\'s many districts and markets written from the perspective of a poor Kentish farmer. We also have an array of contemporary art depicting markets and popular food and drink, whether in paintings, illustrations, or even murals. Ælfric suggests that fish was a popular and commonplace source of fresh meat for many people, and offered a great variety of choice from both maritime and riverine sources. Certainly, the fisherman who appears in the Colloquy suggests that, when he goes to market, he easily sells out his catch to the crowd there. Depending on your location, the fish available might include: eels, pike, minnows and dace, trout, lamprey and any other species that swim in the rivers, like sprats... herring, salmon, dolphins, sturgeon, oysters, crabs, mussels, cockles, flatfish, plaice, lobsters and such like. Mackerel feature again in London Lickpenny, when they are one of the plentiful street foods being sold by hawkers in the city\\'s various markets. Other street foods include cooked pigs\\' feet and sheep\\'s feet, hot peas (cooked in pods so presumably like a mangetout), rissoles, stews, and an assortment of pies. Contemporary illustrations show that bread rolls and small loaves were also sold by enterprising bakers to market crowds, although of course in a village setting, people would likely bake their own bread. The 15th century Libro de componere herbe et fructi shows market traders selling onions and radishes, while the 13th century Les Cris de Paris (The Cries of Paris) details the various traders of the city\\'s markets and their distinctive cries in a series of woodcuts. One of these includes a \\'vegetable seller\\' who carries turnips and a variety of legumes: peas, lentils, chickpeas and the like. 14th and 15th Century depictions of market scenes (such as at Issogne) show cabbages, parsnips, carrots, peas, mushrooms, marrows, a wide variety of pumpkins and squash, garlic, radish, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, gooseberries, hawthorns, rosehips, sloes, apples, crab apples, rowans, elderberries, cherries, plums and damsons. Les Cris de Paris suggest that milk was a regular part of the diet, as there were apparently specialised milk hawkers at the Paris markets, who presumably collected surplus from dairy farmers and took it to market to sell, or indeed were themselves the dairy farmers selling their surplus. Cheese was therefore also a useful source of both protein and fat. An early 14th Century illustration from the Maastrict Book of Hours (British Library Stowe 17, Fol. 67r) depicts a woman carrying several small wheels of cheese in a basket on her way to a market, (In her other arm she carries a rabbit, illustrating that \\'small game\\' hunting could still be a ready source of meat), and indeed one of the major markets in 14th Century Bruges was known as the Cheese Hall (Murray, 2011). Two 15th Century images (Campin\\'s Nativity and the Armorial de Revel) both feature details illustrating peasant women carrying large baskets of eggs, which would suggest a certain commonality of consumption. Eggs certainly feature in a number of medieval recipes. A fairly wide assortment of medieval recipes survive today in a number of manuscripts. While some are clearly limited to the wealthy (such as \\'Cressy\\', a spiced, platted sweet bread containing a variety of dried fruits and saffron), others suggest that peasant food wasn\\'t solely limited to stews. 13th Century sources (British Library 32085) include recipes for meatballs (known colloquially as oranges), pancakes, vegetarian ravioli stuffed with cheese and mushrooms, fruit pies and pastries topped with soft cheese, hawthorn soup, meatloaf and sausages. A 1340 text includes a number of blancmanges (which the 9th Century medical textbook known as Bald\\'s Leechbook advises as good food for the ill and recovering injured), uses for almonds, hazelnuts, pine nuts and chestnuts, a \\'rabbit stew popular in England and France\\' and fried eels, and 1380 source includes blood sausage, a hare broth, apple fritters, oxtongue, apple porridge, baked lamprey, lamprey soup and fish with a bread sauce/crust. The 1390 Forme of Cury includes a bean and bacon broth noted as being \\'a dish of the poorer householder\\', as was \"caboches in potage\" (a cabbage stew containing onions and leeks) and the similar \"rapes in potage\", a turnip stew. Also includes mushrooms fried with leeks, and a kind of pork and squash stew involving eggs.',\n",
       " 'During the First World War, the Western front became the most multicultural and multiracial region of earth. Alongside millions of white soldiers came millions of non-white soldiers from across the world, ranging from New Caledonia to Cameroon and Siam (Thailand). The First World War became a world war through the involvement of the peoples, not because it was fought across the world. Within a few months of the start of the First World War, indigenous peoples from the Americas had already stepped onto European shores in order to fight against the German Empire. Among them was a young man of the Kainai Nation named Albert Mountain Horse. As a soldier in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, he participated in the Second Battle of Ypres in 1915 and was gassed multiple times during his brief participation in the war. The injuries he sustained from gas would leave him incapable of continuing to serve. After being evacuated to Canada, he would die at the tender age of 22 -- pneumonia ultimately taking his life. His brothers, Mike and Joe Mountain Horse, would follow in his footsteps. Mike Mountain Horse would later write a memoir in which he told about his time in the war, My People the Bloods . More importantly, however, is Mike Mountain Horse\\'s Story Robe. Following the traditions of the Kainai Nation, and in collaboration with its elders, Mike created his own robe that he inscribed with pictographs showing his martial deeds during the First World War. The pictographs were accompanied by captions that were written down and assigned a specific pictograph. These included, for example, war deed no. 10 that narrated how, \"While on patrol duty, Mountain Horse fought a hand to hand, fight with three Germans, killing two of the Germans with his War knife.\" (August 9th, 1917). This is an amazing example of the wider definition of \\'war literature\\' that historians have begun to focus on in relation to the First World War. For the majority of the historiography of the First World War, the written words of white European soldiers have been privileged and canonized, effectively obscuring and marginalizing the different means in which non-white soldiers recorded their stories. Mike Mountain Horse\\'s Story Robe holds no less importance or validity as a primary source than Ernst Junger\\'s Storm of Steel or Robert Grave\\'s Good-Bye to All That. Yet it was not a given that the indigenous peoples of North America would be allowed to participate in the First World War. Official policies regarding non-white soldiers was contradictory, pragmatic, and sometimes downright confusing. While Australia, for example, explicitly denied the indigenous peoples of Australia the chance to enlist (many managed to do it anyway), the United States did not have an issue enlisting or drafting indigenous peoples. In fact, they quite welcomed it based on the racist idea of indigenous peoples being inherently war-like in their very core. This notion of the \\'noble savage\\', men who knew how to fight and who were expert scouts, was an idea that Canada shared as well. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that indigenous men from both the United States and Canada were first and foremost placed in positions of scouts and snipers -- roles they were considered particularly suited for. In comparison, African American and black Canadian soldiers were first and foremost seen as suitable to hold a shovel and work as laborers behind the frontline due to their assumed racial inferiority and mental capabilities (many black Canadian and African American men did see action as combat soldiers, however). Yet in Canada, it was not obvious that its indigenous peoples would be allowed to fight. At first, non-white soldiers were restricted from enlisting (even though plenty of them did anyhow). It was only as it became apparent that the war would be considerably longer and more costly in casualties that the Canadian government turned to actively recruiting indigenous men in large numbers. Among them were indigenous men from the United States who chose to join the Canadian Expeditionary Force long before the entry of the United States in the war in 1917. The reasons for why indigenous men voluntarily enlisted in the armies of both nations is a complex question and not easily answered. There were, of course, normal reasons, such as employment, a way to get away from home and see the world, or the thrill of possible fighting in a war, that were similar to those held by young white men. However, deeper questions such as a desire to show loyalty to Canada (and in extension, the British Empire) or the United States and a desire to increase their social status within their indigenous nations (through the invocation of certain warrior traditions, for example) were equally as valid reasons for young men to join. Some of the indigenous elite saw the participation of young men from their communities in the war as a way to demand increased autonomy, self-determination, and equality. As with many other non-white peoples across the world in the aftermath of the First World War, the hope that indigenous participation in the war would cause a change for indigenous peoples at home would promptly be extinguished as it became apparent that there would be no real recognition of their participation. This is only a short overview over an incredibly interesting and complex topic with plenty more to be said.

       " 'Identity was fragmented in the late medieval period, as it is now. With urban, regional, linguistic, religious, national, and regnal identitarian ties all existing in the same individuals. National identities which correspond to modern nation-states, such as French or English, existed, and scholars cite to their increasing prominence even in the early 14th century. For example in English royal proclamations which makes appeals and reference to the English nation. So yes, elites had a sense of being ‘Burgundian.’ But on the other hand the rise of mass nationalism is often said to have not matured until the levee en masse of the Napoleonic wars. And you will even find scholarship arguing that France did not truly coalesce into a single national identity until WWI. The Hundred Years War encompassed a number of regional pushes for greater regional autonomy or independence, which have both important similarities and important difference with modern \"independence movements.\" Similar, in that they were often delineated along the lines of linguistic or regional identities, like many modern independence movements. France did not speak a unified French but a range of quite different dialects (and cultures), from celtic Brittonic, to Gascon, to Norman. The Gascon-speaking duchy of Gascony fought hard, at times, to remain subjects of the English king. The larger war between the English and French kings encompassed proxy wars between rival claimants in the duchies of Burgundy and Brittany, Brittany in particular was linguistically and culturally distinct from neighboring areas. But an important difference is that these movements are elite-led to an even greater degree than modern movements; and largely relate to elite dynastic claims and elite desires to lower taxes or decrease feudal obligations, rather than linguistic/cultural/national self-determination for the people. The life of the average peasant did not change much whether their ultimate sovereign was the French or English king. And laws, taxes, systems of administration were quite localized for the most part. National governance systems, state functions, and centralization were limited. National “independence” would mean little difference except for high ranking nobles (such as the duke of Brittany). This class-based critique is true, to a degree, of modern independence movements. But is far more pronounced in the late medieval period. The bottom line, is that the idea or paradigm we have of modern nation states, or national identity, existed in a way. But the predominant political identity and idea of how states were organized was a much different feudal one. You are a subject of your sovereign, the sovereign governs by divine right, sovereignty does not flow from the people themselves. This is manifested in how many peasant revolts sought to replace the “king’s wicked advisors” rather than tear down the Monarchical system. The idea of nation-states, where the state should have a unified language, culture, and governance was largely non-existent. Most political states in Europe were a patchwork of languages, cultures, laws, and feudal relationships. Nobles often spoke different a first language and were culturally distinct from the people they ruled. Though these distinctions were beginning to erode in the late medieval period. Under Edward III parliament was opened in English for the first time and English became the language of courts, but it was not until Henry V that English became the language of the royal Administration. Identity is of course not monolithic, and there are exceptions and nuance to all of this. But your last paragraph gets the general sense, national identities existed but were much weaker than modern ones, and were not central to contemporary ideas about how states were organized.',\n",
       " 'Greetings! This is a most pertinent question to ask, for it seems most curious that Russia and Austria-Hungary experienced a complete reversal in relations despite the close bond shared between the two (most notably, as you have pointed out, in Russian intervention during the 1848/9 Revolution in Hungary). Unfortunately, this answer is one which has been largely overshadowed by the larger picture of the diplomatic relations at the outbreak of the war, and as such historiography on why the relations deteriorated so quickly is rather outdated or (as far as my expertise goes), a tad hard to locate. Regardless, let us see what we can do to answer your query, beginning of course, with Europe in 1853. The Roaring Bear and the Double-Sided Eagles In 1853 we find the origins of the Crimean War as the first major upheaval in Austro-Hungarian-Russian relations. The occupation by Russia of the Danubian Principalities shortly after the debacle over the rights of Christians in the Holy Land sparked a series of negotiations between the powers of Europe. The Austro-Hungarian Empire was quick to react to the occupation in particular, joining with Britain and France in drafting the Vienna Note, which (without getting too far into its technicalities and interpretations), accepted the legitimate claims of Russia to the Ottoman-Christian territories, without overriding the authority of the Sultan. Tsar Nicholas I accepted this offer, but the Turks demanded certain changes which would have made the final Note unacceptable to the Russians. This diplomatic back-and-forth went on for a while, until the Western Powers were persuaded to (with the supposed backing of Austria-Hungary) issue an ultimatum that the Russian immediately leave the Danubian Principalities by April 30th, 1954. When the tsar made no reply and the Habsburg support turned out to be merely diplomatic rather than militarily, Britain and France declared war on March 27th. It is this \"big picture\" narrative of events that we must keep in mind, as we pick out the specifics of the Austro-Hungarian Empire\\'s role in the negotiations. The Habsburg monarchy was a critical consideration for the policy-makers in St. Petersburg, including the Tsar himself. To that end, Count Orlov (a prominent diplomat) was dispatched to Vienna in January 1854 in order to secure Austrian neutrality for the war which was predicted to come (the Russian minister in Berlin was ordered to do the same for the Prussians). So concerned with the intervention of Prussia and Austria-Hungary was Russia, that Orlov was authorised to guarantee the integrity of Austria-Hungary from French hostilities. Knowing full well that such negotiations would add another complex dimension to the overarching ones with Britain, France, and the Ottomans, a young Emperor Franz Joseph declined to talk about such matters. Both he and the Austrian Empire\\'s foreign minister Count Karl Ferdinand von Buol insisted instead that Russian troops not cross the Danube, for that would incite further reason for Austria to side with the Western Powers. Mind you, the Western Powers were also finding it rather difficult to deal with Vienna in their own diplomatic efforts. It would not be an overstatement to suggest that the opinion of the Austro-Hungarian Empire quite literally was the lynchpin of the entire negotiation process. This was particularly evident in the surprise of the Western Powers when Austrian support for the ultimatum turned out to be merely diplomatic in nature. Historian Bernadotte E. Schmitt writing in 1919 about this concern notes: \"They presented their ultimatum for the evacuation of the Principalities on the understanding that Austria would support it, whereas she actually gave only diplomatic approval, not a promise of military assistance, which alone would have compelled Russia to yield.\" The difficulty for the Austrians was considerable. The memory of Russia\\'s intervention (and specifically that of Tsar Nicholas I) during the Crisis of 1848 remained in the minds of both Emperor Franz Joseph (who came to power largely in part thanks to Russian assistance) and top-level advisors across the Empire. However, all of them also feared that if Russia maintained dominance in the Danubian Principalities, she would set up vassal states whose Slavic majorities would lead to further complications with the Slavic populations living under the Dual Monarchy. On the other hand, these leaders were also reluctant to cooperate with Britain or France in their opposition to Russia. The former was viewed as the home of liberalism and the home-in-exile of Hungarian lawyer Lajos Kossuth, who had played a considerable part in the 1848-9 revolution. The latter, ruled by Napoleon III, was viewed as the champion of Italian independence, which upset Austro-Hungarian rule in the region. In the end, Austria became increasingly hostile towards her old ally in the east. After Count Orlov admitted that Russia would indeed set up vassal states in the Balkans, the Emperor insisted that they now only conduct military campaigns on the Asiatic side of the Ottoman Empire (an impossibility given that the main crux of hostilities lay in Eastern Europe). Even as the Russian troops crossed the Danube on March 22nd, the Austrians were reluctant to place their army on high-alert. They would remain neutral throughout the war, but Buol\\'s ultimatum in 1855 that Russia accept Anglo-French peace terms or face a war with the Dual Monarchy further alienated the Habsburgs in Vienna from the Romanovs in St. Petersburg. Austria at this point was isolated. Her neutrality during the Crimean War strained relations with the Western Powers who relied on her support for a peaceful outcome, and her betrayal of the Russians meant that she was surrounded by potential enemies on all sides. In the next bit, we will fast forward to the critical years of the 1870s, when the \"Eastern Question\" arises again and a legendary figure in diplomacy tries to mend the gap between the former allies.

       " 'The Iron Chancellor and the Three Emperors Note: parts of this response were adapted from an earlier comment on the failure of \"colonial war treaties\" in the 19th century In the previous response we touched on the diplomatic blunders of the Crimean War and how the actions of Austria-Hungary during this time distanced it from both Russia and the other European powers as well... well all for one. Just before Austrian troops were put on high-alert and the Russian crossed the Danube, the Habsburg Monarchy managed to secure an alliance with the Prussians. This alliance never had to wield its guns in the Crimean War, but it did set a precedent of thinking in Vienna which would characterise the next several decades of Austro-Hungarian diplomacy. When the Prussians defeated the French and gained Alsace-Lorraine after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, the Austrians now had a new major power on the continent to deal with. In Berlin the Austrians had to deal with no less a figure than Otto von Bismarck, whose diplomatic insight and talent as the \"Iron Chancellor\" were well-known throughout Europe. Bismarck for his part, also knew the importance of balancing the influence of Austrian-German-Russian influence in the East. Russian ambitions in the Balkans were more pressing than ever, and it was these considerations which led Austria to conclude a Dual Alliance with Germany in 1879. Here\\'s the first article of that Treaty, which immediately targets a former ally of Vienna: \"ARTICLE 1. Should, contrary to their hope, and against the loyal desire of the two High Contracting Parties, one of the two Empires be attacked by Russia the High Contracting Parties are bound to come to the assistance one of the other with the whole war strength of their Empires, and accordingly only to conclude peace together and upon mutual agreement.\"^ Clearly, we already have the antagonising of the Russian Bear occurring more than 30 years before the events of June 28th, 1914. In continuation with the Crimean War\\'s events, this seemed a logical development. However, do not be swayed to believe that Russia took this threat to mean more than it was meant to. One must not forget that shortly after this treaty came the Dreikaiserbund, or League of the Three Emperors, an actual formal alliance between Russia, Germany and Austria-Hungary which came into effect in 1881, an attempt by Otto von Bismarck to mediate the power balance in Europe. On the subject of Tsar Alexander III\\'s concern over his nation\\'s security facing the Dual Alliance, Laurence B. Packard writes: As long as the general European status quo did not alter too much, the Tsar did not regard Russia\\'s isolation seriously.^ Granted, the Dual Alliance of 1879 remained a constant thorn in the side of the Russians, but it did not spell the complete end of relations between them and the Austrians. Tsar Alexander III would go on to sign the Reinsurance Treaty of 1887 with Germany, which acknowledged the Russian claims over the Balkan \\'sphere of influence as noted by Article 2 below: Germany recognizes the rights historically acquired by Russia in the Balkan Peninsula, and particularly the legitimacy of her preponderant and decisive influence in Bulgaria and in Eastern Rumelia. The two Courts engage to admit no modification of the territorial status quo of the said peninsula without a previous agreement between them, and to oppose, as occasion arises, every attempt to disturb this status quo or to modify it without their consent.^ Take note of how the \"Near East\" question of the Balkans remained a key consideration for all of the parties involved in these negotiations. All three had designs for Eastern Europe, and the \"sick man of Europe\" was beginning to show signs of cracking in the 1870s all the way up to the 1900s. However, already by this time Russia seemed to be uncertain of how legitimate Bismarck\\'s assurances truly were. After all, Bismarck himself was nearly at the end of his esteemed career (being dismissed in 1890) and this agreement would come only a year before the coronation of Kaiser Wilhelm II, who certainly did not share the same cooperative outlook that his father had. When that change finally did occur, Alexander III was more receptive to an Alliance with France, as the German Empire now appeared more concerned with colonial acquisitions (and as a result, was drawn towards deal-making with the British) than continuing the animosity towards Russia that Wilhelm I & Bismarck had facilitated. The next crucial document we might look at is the France-Russian Military Alliance Convention of 1892, in which France and Russia were directly linked in an alliance which specifically singled out the powers of the 1882 Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy) as potential instigators of an attack: If France is attacked by Germany, or by Italy supported by Germany, Russia shall employ all her available forces to attack Germany. If Russia is attacked by Germany, or by Austria supported by Germany, France shall employ all her available forces to attack Germany.^ By this time, the Germans had come to the forefront of the discussions on hostilities in St. Petersburg, London, and Paris. Though the Austro-Hungarian Empire remained a key player, it had been overshadowed (if only for a brief moment) with the rapid rise of German expansionist desires. If we must point towards a critical \"nail in the coffin\" moment of Habsburg-Russian relations, then attention must be drawn towards the Bosnian Crisis of 1908-09, when the Austrians declared their annexation of the former Ottoman Vilayet (administrative district) of Bosnia and Herzegovinia. This of course, was met with massive protestations from Serbia and Russia, who viewed it as further Austrian infringement on the Slavic people\\'s independence in the Balkans. Interestingly, the 1909 Treaty of Berlin saw the Austrians backed by the British and French who believed that further escalation would lead to a repeat of the events of 1854. Conclusion So there we have it, a two-part overview of the 60 or so years between the Hungarian Revolution of 1848/9 and the final straw in Austrian-Russian relations in 1909. The reasons why such close allies drifted further and further apart was geopolitical in nature: the \"Near East\" question was always on the minds of policymakers and conference tables in the late 1800s, and those in Vienna eyed those in St. Petersburg with apprehension at the thought of Russian dominance threatening Austro-Hungarian security in Eastern Europe. I hope this response has been helpful, and feel free to ask any follow-ups as you see fit!',\n",
       " 'I\\'m going to preface this by saying I am not an expert in Mongol/Mongolian studies nor in the history of education in Japan. Others may be more qualified to comment. However, from what I can gather, the overarching answer is that the vast, vast majority of Japanese in the 19th and early 20th centuries knew nothing about the Mongols. As I understand it, \"history\" as a topic was not really taught prior to the education reforms that took place after the Meiji restoration. Schools, themselves, weren\\'t even \"common\" in the same way that we think of modern schooling. Temple schools (terakoya, 寺子屋) that taught reading, writing, math, etc didn\\'t really pop up until the Edo period (17th-19th centuries), and prior to that, education was generally reserved for nobles, samurai, and clergy with an education focused on reading, writing, and arithmetic (naturally), along with the Chinese classics such as the Laozi, I Ching, etc. Such influence can be seen in various cultural aspects of the time, from incorporation into Court ritual to concepts in martial art schools and more. Generally speaking, I\\'m not sure history was taught or successfully taught anywhere in the world before the modern era to commoners. How much of ancient Greek/Roman life did a French commoner or noble know in the 18th century outside of the classics? China would be a good bet for more structured historical learning, as there were numerous institutions across different dynasties for educational awareness. But history as a subject is odd because it requires a degree of objectivity in order to know and understand. We\\'re lucky in this forum to be able to have such objectivity. A daimyo in the Edo era with a less-than-favorable view of the Tokugawa during the Sengoku Jidai during the 16th century likely would not be able to get away with that. Similarly, Chinese history of the Mongols at the time of their existence (13th century) were far from objective. As such, history for commoners was found more in stories and the classics than any real legitimate scholarship... and only if the subject was a common one. Turning to the Mongols, there was no successful invasion of Japan, which meant no real impact to daily life that would be cause for historical remembrance. After the failed invasions, warriors that participated in the brief fights in the Hakata/Kyushu area did submit demands to the Court for rewards/title; in 1275AD, the bakufu rewarded 120 warriors for their services, for example. Success in routing the second invasion that never made it to the mainland yielded a similar result. Shortly after the second attack, there was intense factional conflicts at Court and it wouldn\\'t be long until the Kamakura bakufu fell. Oral history of family title/reward due to Mongol invasion attempts may have been remembered, but scholars didn\\'t suddenly pen the great 元軍記 (Kengun-ki, \"Story of the Mongol Forces\"... that\\'s what I suspect it would have been called if it existed). Changes emerged in the Kyushu region as a result of the failed invasions, though they were not of real impact to daily life and, thus, not historically captured for posterity in any great degree. What we do know is that Takezaki Suenaga, a warrior during the invasions, commissioned two sets of handscrolls in the late 13th to early 14th century. These scrolls called the moko shurai ekotoba 蒙古襲来絵詞 and, apparently, they were only known to a few warrior families in Kyushu for ~500 years before they were widely disseminated across Japan. The scrolls were considered valuable enough to not be discarded, but they were not given any special care. Historians also note that the scrolls were altered over time. From what I understand, Suenaga\\'s name was even scratched out by another family in the 16th century (the Oyano 大矢野). It wasn\\'t until Arai Hakuseki, a scholar/advisor to the Tokugawa bakufu in the 18th century, that these scrolls came to be seen as a historical source. Fun fact - Suenaga\\'s family suffered during the transition to the Muromachi bakufu and the Nawa family 名和 ended up with the scrolls until Nawa Akinori\\'s marriage into the Oyano family. What makes this fun is the Nawa family\\'s association with warrior groups and shrines at the time, including those who may be considered ninja. Kinda cool to think ninja were keeping such secrets in the 15th century! Early histories of the invasions in Japan rely almost exclusively on the Yuan-shi 元史 (History of the Yuan Dynasty) from China, compiled by the Ming after the Yuan dynasty fell. The Isho Nihon-den 異稱日本伝 (Treatises on Japan under Different Titles), written in 1537 and published in fifteen volumes in 1693, contains references to the dynastic histories written in China and Korea (the Yuan-shi and the Goryeosa 高麗史, History of the Goryeo Period, both of which were compiled approximately a century after the invasions). The Gyoju Gaigen 馭戍概言 (General Remarks on Mounted Defenses), written in 1778 by the Kokugaku 国学 scholar Motoori Norinaga, likewise refers almost exclusively to the Yuan-shi in reconstructing the Mongol invasions of Japan. Note that the Yuan-shi was not a commonly read or even owned source in 19th and 20th century Japan, let alone prior to the Meiji restoration. To add to the complexity of the topic, the Yuan-shi was a \"rush job\" in China, being compiled in less than a year. Apparently it was criticized heavily for its mistakes. The section on Mongols was also lacking, due in part to the hatred felt towards them by the Ming compilers. Mongols were described as barbaric and ruthless, important aspects of the culture ignored and left out due to ignorance or choice (noticed by later scholarship). Translations from Mongol sources supposedly were not good. On top of that, compilation of the Yuan-shi took place in Nanjing whereas remnants of the Yuan archives at the time were in Beijing 600+ miles away. Not the best work to be done by court compilers. All that to say knowledge of the Mongols in 19th and early 20th century Japan was most likely confined to what the Chinese wrote in the Yuan-shi combined with biased/altered pictorial evidence from the moko shurai ekotoba (eg, a whole new scene with Japanese carrying mongol heads was added in the 19th century in one reproduced set!). And that knowledge was most likely confined to a super small percentage of elites who purposefully looked for that knowledge... and it was not very good/accurate. Best I can offer, sorry it\\'s not as thorough as it probably should be. It taught me something new trying to put an answer together! Sources- Cambridge History of Japan, Vol. 3 (a bit dated, but still worthwhile) Thomas Conlan - Myth, Memory, and the Scrolls of the Mongol Invasions of Japan Supposedly Japan in the Chinese Dynastic Histories by Ryusaku Tsunoda is a good source for the Yuan-shi in English. I don\\'t own a copy and my nearby library doesn\\'t have it to verify :(',\n",
       " \"Severloh's story is unique, largely because other German machine gunners were unwilling to exaggerate or lie about their experiences to the same extent. The landing on Omaha Beach was carried out by two divisions of the USA's V Corps; the 1st and 29th. Taken together, these divisions counted a total of 1,779 casualties to all causes on D-Day - 1,036 from the 1st and 743 from the 29th. When we count the V Corps troops that also landed on Omaha, such as the 5th Ranger Battalion, the number climbs to 2,220 killed, wounded or missing. This covers the entire frontage of Omaha Beach, and throughout the whole day, including after Severloh's position was neutralised. It also counts casualties caused by things other than small-arms fire, such as artillery fire and mines. If we take Severloh's claims at face value, then there must have been only ~220 casualties suffered along the whole rest of the beach, or caused by artillery fire, anti-tank guns, mines, drowning and the like. This does not seem credible, given the reports of heavy fighting along the beach, as well as frequent shellings by artillery and mortars. Given this, the only conclusion we can draw is that Severloh, at best, overestimated his claims. Severloh was also not the only machine gunner at his strongpoint. Severloh was stationed at a position called Widerstandsnest 62 (Resistance Nest 62), or WN62. The main strength of WN62 was in its AT guns, with one modern 75mm gun and two old ex-Belgian 75mm guns, plus a 50mm gun. There were three mortars (2 50mm and one 81mm) positioned towards the rear, and three MGs. The MGs were distributed around the strongpoint, to ensure that a single shell could not knock all three of them out. Spreading them out also helped to reduce the number of locations where troops advancing up the beach could find cover - a location that was in cover from one MG might be vulnerable to another off on the flank. Severloh's gun was in a bunker, along with an artillery spotter. Another MG, likely an MG34, was in a 'Tobruk' position. This was a small, concrete one-man position, essentially a foxhole with better production values. The final MG was in a forward position, and one that was more rudimentary. The gun was a captured Polish weapon dating back to WWI, in a log and sandbag dugout. There were positions like WN62 dotted along the Normandy coastline. There was a wide variety of strongpoints. Some were dug into already-existing buildings, such as WN37 at Le Hamel on Gold Beach, which reused the buildings of an old sanitorium. WN20, on Sword Beach, used sea-front houses to cover its bunkers. Others, like WN62 or WN5 on Utah Beach, were dug into the landscape, with completely new bunkers being constructed. The strongpoints, however, were not quite as well protected as the name suggests. Priority for construction had gone to the defences of the Pas de Calais, the part of the French coast that was closest to the UK, and therefore seen as a more likely target for an invasion. Many of the strongpoints along the Normandy coastline were still under construction; at least one of WN62's bunkers was incomplete on D-Day, and the casemates for the 75mm guns lacked armoured shutters. The bunkers were not armed with modern weapons, with many being armed with obsolete or captured weapons. The lack of supplies for construction and arming bunkers had two other effects. The gaps between bunkers were often too large. In a properly-planned defence system, each bunker or strongpoint would be able to provide its neighbours with covering fire and support; this was often not the case along the Normandy coast. There was also little depth to the defences; once the Allies had broken through the first line of strongpoints, there was little to hold them up behind the beaches. Sword Beach was the only one where there were effective defensive positions further inland. Here, WN17, a mile behind the beaches, would hold up the British 3rd Division's advance inland towards Caen until the evening. Not every beach had the advantages for the defenders that Omaha did. Omaha had steep heights behind the beaches, with only a few exits ('draws') which troops and vehicles could use to get off the beaches. This naturally funnelled the attackers towards certain points, allowing the defenders to concentrate, and gave the defenders advantageous firing positions. The terrain inland of the other beaches was generally flatter and more open. Finally, it should also be noted that the Allies held the advantage. They could pick and choose where to attack, choosing locations that were less well defended. They could interdict German reinforcements, and easily reinforce their troops on the beach. They had much more support and firepower at their disposal. These allowed them to exploit the failings of the German defences. Beyond the inadequacies of the German defences, the Allied success on D-Day also depended on good planning and execution by Allied commanders and troops. The bombardment by both aircraft and ships was generally ineffective, but did suppress the German gunners, cut their lines of communication and distracted the heavy coastal batteries away from firing on the vulnerable transports. As the landings progressed, smaller ships like destroyers also provided more effective fire support to troops on the beach; gunfire from USN destroyers who had come in close to the beach helped to destroy or suppress a number of bunkers on Omaha and helped to break the deadlock. The use of amphibious DD tanks gave the troops who landed in the first waves armoured support. This provided heavy firepower for suppressing bunkers, cover against German fire, and a degree of mobility. Unfortunately, most of the DD tanks on Omaha and Utah were launched too far out from the beach. Many foundered in the high waves, and did not make it to the beach. This caused a significant part of the discrepancy in casualties between the American and British beaches. The arrival of tanks and other armoured vehicles in later waves would be a large part of the Allied breakthrough on Omaha. Finally, Allied infantrymen showed skill and courage in their abilities to advance under fire and knock out bunkers, using rifle grenades, hand-held anti-tank weapons, hand grenades and small-arms fire. While they did take casualties, the Allied infantry proved able to reduce and destroy German strongpoints relatively unsupported. The provision of tanks and naval gunfire reduced the casualties and made it easier to do, but some bunkers were knocked out by infantry alone. WN61, WN62's neighbour, was largely taken out by infantrymen from Company E and F, 116th Infantry Regiment.\",\n",
       " \"why was Hein Severloh's story so unique? Why had other machine gunners not done the same and got a similar body count? Combined Allied casualties for Operation Neptune were just under 4,500 killed in action, out of a total of around 10,000 total casualties spread across 5 landing zones. Due to the weather conditions, peculiarities of terrain and a general lack of the more specialised armour support, especially that seen in British and Canadian sectors, Omaha Beach where Severloh was stationed did have a disproportionate number of casualties, but not staggeringly so. Indeed, the US DoD calculated a total of around 2,400 killed, wounded and missing across all sectors at Omaha. Given that a significant number of casualties were caused by landing craft being swamped or drifting in bad weather and hitting beach defences - 22 LCVPs, 2 LCI(L)s and 4 LCTs were lost en route to Easy Red during the second wave - or by artillery, Severloh's account of killing 2,000 American soldiers is fanciful at best, and outright fantasy at worst. Why was the whole beach line not dotted with a guy with a machine gun? It should not have been a big deal while having a huge effect. The Normandy beaches were heavily fortified. However the MG42 can fire up to 1,300 rounds a minute and the sheer logistical requirements of lining the beach with machine gun emplacements when a few hardpoints could enfilade the entire beach were prohibitively expensive. Thus, what made the Germans fail to succcessfully defend the beach? A staggeringly degree of intelligence and logistical preparation went into Operation Overlord. Allied intelligence services mapped every inch of the landing zones and units were briefed and prepared for very specific objectives. The Americans at Omaha were scuppered largely by the weather, and the fact that so many landing craft were forced off-target, beached, swamped or otherwise prevented from reaching their designated targets. This meant that units that did reach the beach often found themselves nowhere near their practiced objectives, without their planned armour support or heavy equipment - or indeed without any equipment at all - or stranded on sandbard and forced to wade ashore through deep water to reach the shingle. The other beaches were not so badly affected by the weather, and so units were typically able to arrive at their designated targets with their expected support and equipment. Here is some British Pathé footage of some of the specialist armoured units (in these cases based on the Churchill tank) designed to overcome beach obstacles. Note the 290mm spigot mortar on the AVRE, specifically designed to reduce German emplacements like Severloh's to rubble.\",\n",
       " 'This is a pretty tricky question, so there will be even more others can say beyond my contribution. You are correct that the basic formula of a flatbread with things on top are pretty common in many different culinary traditions and that may be a good stepping off point to challenge the premise of your question. Did pizza as we know it \"come from\" another foodstuff or did Italians develop a tradition of baked breads with toppings contemporaneously? To be frank, I cannot answer that question and would be surprised if someone can offer the first novel \\'invention\\' of such baked breads which then radiated out to be further localized in Italian pizza. My instinct is to keep in mind that like all cultural artifacts, food is often shaped by both the people producing it and the larger context of the world they live in. As such it is not unthinkable that even if the notion of baking something adjacent to pizza was learned by Italian bakers, they likely would still claim - with some credibility - that it was their invention. As such, we should probably address the city which claims this authority - and nigh all other authority relevant to pizza! - Naples. The Neapolitan claim to the invention of pizza stretches back into antiquity, well before Marco Polo\\'s journey in the thirteenth century. The consensus as I understand it is that Italian bakers in the various separate cities and polities in early modern Italy were baking bread that was both broadly similar (yeast fed dough with ample olive oil and additives) but also intensely localized variations on what can generally be called focaccia. I am hesitant to even write that word, though, because the claim to who made this bread first and who makes it best can be...an intense discussion to say the least. Regionalism in Italy is difficult to overstate in the modern day - well after unification - and even more so in the early modern period. That said, there is some evidence that the first pizza-adjacent food was a kind of Neapolitan \\'galette\\' which roughly translates to a flat cake or pie. These would not have been sweet dishes in their seventeenth century iteration, but likely would have been savory with additives like olives, cheese or fish. A more clear \\'invention\\' of modern pizza in Naples would come with the Pizza Margherita pioneered by Raffaele Esposito in 1889. The story goes that Esposito, a prominent Neapolitan baker, baked a pie for Queen Margherita of Savoy, consort of the sovereign of a newly united Italy which served as a decidedly Neapolitan expression of patriotism, adorned in three ingredients which served as signifiers of the Italian red, white and green tricolor: tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese and garnished with basil. The queen liked the pizza so much that it became a kind of national food, a signifier of the cultural unification of a previously disunited peninsula. That is a nice story but reality is more complicated. As I mentioned earlier we know that pizza or pizza adjacent breads have been made since antiquity well outside of Italy and there are many regional variations on pizza. While the Neapolitan pizzaiolo has been vaunted to the highest reaches a lowly artisan can achieve in relatively recent history, there is a real problem in claiming that pizza as we know it was invented in 1889: we know people were baking focaccia and other breads with additives under different names all over Italy well before Italy was unified. At what point is it focaccia and and what point is it pizza? At what point do these seemingly unimportant linguistic hangups break down entirely? In Sicily, a common Christmas and feast day foodstuff called sfincione is focaccia topped with tomatoes, breadcrumbs and anchovies. Now a Neapolitan may well want to bring bodily harm down upon you for calling that pizza: it\\'s focaccia. Of course, when Italian immigrants moved to the Americas en masse in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the close knit communities (often by necessity) meant that regional food ways which would have otherwise been separated by hundreds of kilometers were now side by side. If you go to any New York pizzeria worth going today your guaranteed to find two slices on hand and ready to order by the slice. One is the New York style pizza which was derived from the Neapolitan style but made with greater access to meats, cheeses than would have been available to most working class bakers in Naples and also cooked in generally colder ovens. The other is a square pie called a \"grandma\" or \"Sicilian\" slice which very much resembles sfincione but with, again, much easier access to the meats and cheese that were so precious in the Old World. Somehow after moving to the Americas, focaccia seemingly became pizza! So all of this brings me to my real point on the semantics of pizza: what even is pizza? To offer a definition that is, perhaps, too broad I would classify pizza as a wet dough, cooked in a relatively hot oven with various regional and traditional toppings and additives. Furthermore, even if the idea of how to cook this way originated in the Middle East or East Asia, I\\'m inclined to view those flatbreads as something distinct and say that pizza has been - without a doubt - most influenced by working class Italians and those in the vast diaspora of Italians in the nineteenth and twentieth century. The technique, ingredients, procedure and consumption vary wildly from region to region and from city to city to this day with most modern culinary \\'refinement\\' of the form coming from Naples. That said, I do think the most important element here is why these questions are so slippery to historians in the first place: the absence of written sources which illuminate these questions. Most cookbooks were written by relatively affluent professional artisans who worked for royalty in the early modern period and the first truly significant mention of pizza in the modern context is as a culturally patriotic foodstuff served to the first Italian royals. For that reason, the working-class nature of bread baking, often done communally with the intention to be sold cheaply, has evaded the primary sources in which historians derive most of their evidence. As such pizza was, as it is now, something that is profoundly shaped by the individuals and communities that make it and difficult for us to assess the \\'origin of\\' in any overly broad quality.',\n",

       " 'There are many theories of nationalism but what I teach is the distinction established in the early 19th century between revolutionary nationalism and romantic nationalism. First lets define them. Revolutionary nationalism is a contractual nationalism born during the French Revolution following the first steps taken by American revolutionaries. It is contractual between anyone could join the French Nation by swearing on the Constitution. It was a collective group based on shared ideals. It is an inclusive nation in which anyone can join but also anyone can leave or be stripped away of one’s nationality. On the other hand, the Germans under occupation by Napoleon, developed an anti-French kind of nationalism. It’s called romantic nationalism because it takes the sense of antural belonging and feelings of the German romantic movement of that same period. The main idea is that with Romantic nationalism, you are naturally part of the nation thanks to objective and natural elements (at the time it was mainly language and the culture you were born in), it is an exclusive nation with strong barriors to prevent joining it. In this theory, it’s difficult to join a nation and impossible to leave it as you’ll naturally always be part of the nation you were born in. So that’s the first step in why nationalism doesn’t have that good of a rep in Europe, because the concept was born of violence and distinction. As nationalism swept over Europe as the main political theory, it shattered empires through revolutions to free peoples from the Ottoman’s (in Greece 1830), from the Dutch (Belgium 1833), from the Prussians (western german nationalism in 1848), from the Austrians (1848 all over the empire and Hungarians in 1867) and finally after World War 1. For French, the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 was also linked to nationalism as Prussia unified the German states under its control through aggression against Austria first then against France. Already in the 19th century, there were critics of nationalism as a means to more war and more fracture of Europe. It is in the 1830 that the first idea of United States of Europe that would unite Europeans was publicised. But it isn’t the most successful criticism of nationalism, that came in the second half of the 19th century through international socialism and communism, but also anarchy. Those radical ideas simply changed the axioms of politics. As States were more and more defined by their nation (either through being created by the nation itself to gain independence like Belgium and Greece, or through forced assimilation like France and Germany after 1870 through the Kulturkempf or mandatory public education in a set language), they became Nation-states, the core principle of statecraft even today. The socialists and communists were not all like that but a big part was for international communism. They considered the Nation to be a wrong identity basis for the creation of a state and the class according to Marxist principles to be the real definition of citizens of a state. So they flat out rejected nationalism as they called their official meetings « internationals ». This idea failed however in 1914 as workers tried to keep the peace between France, Germany and Britain through workers’ cooperation and the refusal to go into a nationalistic war where workers of the same class would be called to fight. The idea failed because the war did happen and in some countries like France, there was « union sacré » (sacred union) where the workers united with everymember of the nation to bring the nation to victory. In Germany however, with a less strong nation, the sacred union only worked for a time and in 1918 socialists tried a revolution and a few socialist republics emerged, in Bavaria for example. But of course the most important socialist republic was the USSR, the first country without a geographical or ethnic name. It followed the idea of revolutionary nationalism and the spent its whole existence pretending nationalism didn’t exist before finally realising in the 1970s that many ethnic groups started using violence to access recognition for their nation through language, ethnic leaders instead of Moscow leaders etc. The violence even turned to pogroms in the Caucasus. The Anarchist rejected even the idea of State and thus the idea of nation attached to it as they aim at auto-organized small units of collective life and decision making. Nation-state = one nation, one territory, one state. We’ll come to that later. So for now, we have nationalism that was linked already in the mid 19th century to violence between Europeans, and a new mindset based on class instead of Nations, while nations became to nation-states through forced assimilation or revolution. Now, before we get to the big moment that completely changed nationalism’s rep in the Western world, it’s important to keep in mind that by the end of the 19th century, nations in Europe were somewhat between the classic Revolutionary and Romantic nationalism. Ernest Renan made a foundational speech in 1882 defining nations as a group with a collective memory of strong events (good or bad) and the will to form a political project together. It’s is a mix of both theories as people are in a contractual relation with the nation, they perpetually reaffirm their part in this nation as Renan says it « is an everyday plebiscit ». But this contract is based on cultural elements that you are born in, that are thrust upon you. Still today, nation-states are more or less in the middle, between those two versions of nationalism. Now in the 1930s with Nazism, the idea of purely ethnic romantic nationalism emerged. It spread to other countries and of course lead to th Second World War and more importantly to genocide and concentration camps. The Nazis returned to the Romabtic nationalism of their ancestors and turned it into something even more natural, not only language but blood, pure blood. In other words, they created ethnic nationalism to supercede cultural nationalism. That’s the first idea why ethnic nationalism and white nationalism have a terrible rep, they were designed and implemented by Nazis in Europe, which is why today those terms are mainly used by neo-nazis in Europe and the US. The Nazis pushed the idea of Nation-state to extremes. After having established a blood-related definition of nation, they took over the state completely and then turned to the final idea : one territory. Theorized by geographer Ratael as Lebensraum, the vital space, it basically established a rational basis for genocide and ethnic cleansing. A nation needs a vital space to be able to fully emerge and reach its full potential. Within the mindset of ethnic nationalism, this justified the Nazis in conquering Europe and more importantly in massacreing Jewish and Slavic populations to the East as they were considered below the pure German nation and as a hindrance to the German nation as it aimed at reaching its full potential. After WW2, in Europe nationalism had a terrible reputation and became completely linked to Nazis and the extreme to which they pushed the theory. This rejection of nationalism is what pushed decentralisation policies but more importantly European federalism best examplified through the burgeoning European Union. The idea was to bring nationalism back to an inclusive and more open definition while creating European institutions that would supercede nations. Basically, nationalism was blamed for WW2 after the Nazis pushed it to a genocidal extreme. However, even if in the 1990s with a new wave of genocidal nationalism in the Balkans that lead to ethnic cleansing, European countries are still closely attached to their nations and nationalism still prevails. It is considered that only the extreme lefties or europhiles imagine anything beyond nations as nationalism is the basis for our nation-states. The past century however dialed it down a bit and while we still grow up in nationalistic symbols and history, only the more extremes on the right are attached to stricter definitions of nationalism, and most of these stricter definitions reach « ethnic nationalism » with an idea of blood purity or even of incompatible natural distinctions based on religion (islamophobia), skin color (white nationalism) or culture (xenophobia). That’s why nationalism has such a bad rep, because we saw it reach its extreme quite easily and the history of the concept has been written in blood. But its bad reputation isn’t as strong as you think, there are still strong nationalist parties and groups in Europe. Even to some extent many « reasonable » parties still are nationalistic even if they paint it differently (French president Macron tried to put forward the idea of patriotism rather than nationalism but it boils down to the same thing, being proud of ones nation-state). The term nationalism is really easily linked to the words « ethnic » and « white » but this union is quite litteraly Nazism as Nazis pushed the definition of nationalism to these extremes. So TL:DR nationalism is a spectrum and the Nazis and later in the Balkans it was pushed to its genocidal extreme through ethnic nationalism. So now, even though the Western world is still very nationalistic in its culture, people tend to be wary of nationalism that can easily get to use an extreme definition, which is still used by racist, xenophobic or simply neo-Nazi groups. We tend to be nationalistic without saying we are to not be associates with those groups, so the word nationalism has been used mostly by those extreme groups who aren’t ashamed of the extremes nationalism can get to.',\n",
       " 'Oh hey, it\\'s the question Stalin and the Soviet government were asking until 1944! Anyway, I\\'ll try to make this a non-list answer...but it might come across that way, and I need to link to answers for further justice to many of these topics. The Blitz is traditionally given as ending in May 1941, although it\\'s not like this was a formal end. It was the last major attack by the Luftwaffe on London before resources began to be repositioned for the impending attack on the USSR. The Luftwaffe would return for a series of air attacks on the UK over the course of the war, such as in the \"Baedeker\" raids in March 1942, and Operation Steinbock/the \"Baby Blitz\" in early 1944. These were replaced with attacks by V-1 missiles in June 1944 and V-2 missiles in September 1944, and those attacks continued all the way to late March 1945. While all of these raids caused much less destruction and strategic danger to Britain, they did mean maintaining active air defenses over Britain and dealing with civilian casualties all the way almost to the end of the war. Britain\\'s own air war was a major undertaking, and as I discuss in that linked answer that I wrote British (and later American) strategic bombing of Germany was seen initially a means of giving Germany a taste of its own medicine, and then a substitute for a Second Front. The RAF had been bombing German targets from mid-1940 on, and continued to do so throughout the war, although bombings in 1940 and 1941 were extremely limited in geographic area and effectiveness. The strategic bombing campaign began to adopt \"dehousing\" and area bombing as a strategy in 1942, and from June 1943 the Combined Bomber Offensive got underway, with the RAF focusing on night time area bombings (ie, burning down German cities) while the USAAF focused on daylight raids on infrastructure (in theory, although the results were often similar to the RAF). While Dresden at the end of the war gets all of the controversy, there were major raids over the course of the war, such as Hamburg being targeted in a bombing raid in July 1943 that caused a firestorm killing some 30,000-40,000 people, and Berlin being targeted in major air offensives in September 1943 and February 1944. As for the naval war - a major campaign over the course of the entire war was the Battle of the Atlantic, the attempt by German submarines to enforce a naval blockade on the British Isles and starve it of resources. The major part of the campaign was fought between mid-1941 and mid-1943, when German U-boats were a major threat to transatlantic convoys. I honestly won\\'t be able to do this subject justice, so for more information I would recommend this answer by u/thefourthmaninaboat. I would also note that the Royal Navy was also dealing with maintaining supply routes and convoys to the USSR after June 1941, and this involved a lot of action against German forces along the Northern Route to Murmansk. A major focus of the British army from 1941 to 1944 was in the Mediterranean. This was part of the \"Peripheral Strategy\", where rather than risk a direct attack on German-held continental Europe, British forces would operate against German and Italian forces in the Mediterranean and undermine the Axis that way. In the spring of 1941, this involved supporting Greece in its defense against Axis invaders. British and Commonwealth forces had been stationed in Greece from March, and the Axis launched a swift and successful invasion of the country about a month later. Probably the most notable action in that campaign was the Battle of Crete, where German paratroops captured the island in a pyrrhic victory. u/fourthmaninaboat as some background on that battle here and u/Georgy_K_Zhukov has some information on the consequences of the battle here Perhaps the most notable campaign in this theater was the Western Desert campaign, where the British 8th Army (especially under General Montgomery, who commanded it from mid 1942 to mid 1943) engaged the Italian army and German Afrika Korps (famously commanded by Erwin Rommel) in Libya and Egypt. The most notable battles were the sieges of Tobruk (successfully defended by British and Commonwealth forces in 1941, captured by the Axis in 1942) and the Battles of El Alamein in 1942, the second one of which, fought in October/November 1942, gets treated as a decisive turning point in the war, comparable to the Battle of Midway or the Battle of Stalingrad (Churchill later wrote: \"Before Alamein we never had a victory. After Alamein, we never had a defeat.\"). The British and Americans formed a Combined Chiefs of Staff from mid 1942 on to coordinate strategy, and this resulted in a number of combined campaigns. Besides the afore-mentioned Combined Bomber Offensive, it included Operation Torch and the North African campaign from November 1942 to May 1943, which saw the complete defeat of Axis forces on the continent, followed by the invasion of Sicily and Italian campaign from July 1943 to the end of the war. British and Commonwealth forces were involved in significant battles such as the Landings at Salerno and the Battle of Monte Cassino. A further discussion of the Italian Campaign and Churchill\\'s focus on the \"Soft Underbelly of Europe\" can be found here starting with an answer by u/Ornlu_Wolfjarl. A final point should be made that British and Commonwealth forces weren\\'t just engaged strictly around Europe in 1941-1944, but across the world. Italian East Africa was conquered in a campaign in 1941, the British conducted a series of campaigns against Vichy colonies, such as Madagascar and Syria, and also had to contend with war against the Japanese from December 1941. The battleships Prince of Wales and Repulse were sunk by the Japanese in a Pearl-Harbor-for-the-British on December 10, 1941 (discussed here by DBHT14...I think I\\'m out of mentions for this comment), and the British lost major land offensives to the Japanese resulting in the surrender of Hong Kong and Singapore in late 1941-early 1942. By mid 1942, British focus in the region was on fighing along the Burma-India frontier. Notable actions in Burma included the Arakan Offensive in 1942, the Chindit Operations behind Japanese lines over the course of 1942-43, and the Japanese invasion of India in the spring of 1944, culminating in Japanese defeats at the Battles of Imphal and Kohima. And all of this while the British were extremely busily engaged in constant diplomacy, especially with their US and Soviet counterparts, as well as preparing for Operation Overlord in June 1944. This is by no means an exhaustive description of British operations and actions in this time period. They were incredibly busy across the globe.',\n",
       " 'Calling ancient and medieval Indian architecture \"progressive\" for its inclusion of nudity is not the best way to frame it. There were many ancient and medieval cultures around the world where women were topless, so ancient India doesn\\'t really stand out in that regard. And the fact that nudity or partial nudity was seen as normal means that it wouldn\\'t have been understood as \"progressive\" to depict human bodies this way, the way that a #FreetheNipple photoshoot would be construed today. First, I\\'ll talk about nudity in other architectural styles. Nudity in art was common in areas influenced by Hinduism and by the wider culture of the Indian subcontinent. One of the most famous examples of nudity in architecture is the 10th century temple of Banteay Srei in Cambodia. The temple was originally called Tribhuvanamaheśvara, but its modern name, which translates to \"citadel of the women\", is a reference to the many depictions of devatas, or demi-goddesses, in the architecture. There are also many apsaras, which are a very common part of Hindu and Buddhist iconography, and take the form of beautiful half-naked women. While these topless women are divine beings, not depictions of real women, their clothing is very similar to that worn by real people in art of the period. For example, at the 9th century Buddhist temple of Borobudur in Java, both queens and commoners are portrayed topless. It\\'s not that surprising that in warm climates it would have been the norm for women to have their breasts exposed. Given how important figurative art is in the history of Hindu and Buddhist architecture, it makes sense that when they portray the human figure, they do so according to both current cultural norms of dress and to iconographic histories (which were in turn influenced by ancient dress norms). The celebration of sexuality was also an important part of Hinduism at the time, which is why you get erotic sculptures in temples like those in Vishvantha Temple (These erotic sculptures may have been connected to tantric practices at the time, which emphasized sex more than other types of Hinduism.) You also get depictions of nudity in architecture beyond Hindu and Buddhist countries. Greek architecture frequently includes depictions of the human form that are sometimes nude, such as the nude Hercules at the Temple of Zeus. The Romans imitated this, sometimes in sculpture but also in mosaic art It\\'s been speculated that the conquests of Alexander the Great led to an increase in figural representations in Indian art due to similar Hellenistic influence. Nude depictions of people in architecture go even further back than that. A nude worshiper offers libations to the goddess Inanna in a relief beside a temple door in 2500 BC; naked men herd cattle on a mural in an Egyptian acropolois from between 2500 and 2300 BC; palace women were depicted topless in the Minoan temple of Knossos from 1800 BC; a musician is topless in the tomb of Nakht from 1400 BC. This huge variety of ancient nude portrayals hints at the wide range of meanings that nudity can hold in different cultures. In tropical parts of the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, women going around with exposed breasts was practical. In ancient Greece and Rome, the nude male figure was romanticized and intellectualized. Mesopotamian priests were sometimes ritually nude. In some Ancient Egyptian art, nudity is portrayed in architecture to show the vulnerability of captives, whereas at other times exposed breasts represent the everyday fashions of the elite or of their slaves. We can\\'t assume that showing breasts or genitalia in architecture is a sign of \"progressivism\" since these body parts\\' significance has been socially constructed in many different ways throughout history. While Abrahamaic traditions brought with them the idea that nudity must be restricted in order to please God, that did not stop depictions of nudity from appearing in architecture of people who followed these faiths. Nudity has continued to form a part of architecture in the medieval and modern periods in many different places across the world. Medieval Europe, particularly Ireland, brought us the Sheela na Gig, grotesque figurines flashing their vulvas in the ceilings and walls of castles and cathedrals. Other times, nudity served to convey a specific story detail in Christian narrative art in churches throughout Christendom, such as in stained glass windows and murals depicting Adam and Eve. Folkloric and mythological themes include nudity in Christian churches too, such as this mermaid on a church pew from Cornwall. You also see nude mermaids incorporated into coats of arms on buildings in the late medieval and early modern periods. The perfection of the human form was also part of the mindset of Renaissance artists who revived ancient Greek and Roman styles of architecture. Michelangelo\\'s Creation of Adam from the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel is a great example of this. You also get a lot of nude depictions of angels in the Renaissance. This built in part on classical motifs as well, with nudity being associated with youth such as in depictions of Cupid Indeed, in many ancient cultures it was the norm for children to be nude until puberty, so the association with youthfulness would have been a natural one. Today there are still cultures where nudity is considered normal. Women of the Zo\\'é tribe in Brazil go completely nude except for their lip plugs, while men sometimes wear loincloths. Again, it\\'s not really \"progressive\" of them to do this, because they have not existed in a cultural context in which \"conservative\" moral weight was attached to the idea of covering up one\\'s breasts or genitals. As to why attitudes towards nudity changed in Indian history, hopefully someone else can come along and answer that. But I hope my answer has demonstrated that depictions of nudity in ancient Indian architecture are far from an outlier in world history.',\n",
       " '/u/Kelpie-Cat gave an answer that is interesting and well thought out. I agree with much of it but there are also elements where I disagree and I think it would be useful to provide a different perspective. For context my main research is not on art history but I have written about depictions of the female form in South Asia and touched on the question of nudity (see for example Bracey, R. ‘Is it appropriate to ask a celestial lady’s age?’ in Rienjang, W. Stewart, P. (eds.) Problems of Chronology in Gandharan Art, 135-48). As that paper indicates my expertise is primarily in the early centuries AD where-as Kelpie-Cat’s answer focuses mostly on the early medieval period. And that is important, there is never a single answer to this sort of question. South Asia is a huge place and people have treated the human form, and the degree to which you reveal it, in a wide variety of ways. To further illustrate that point one of the features of art I discuss, albeit briefly, in that article is the difference in ‘nudity’ between places. In the early centuries AD a visitor to a Buddhist site in Uttar Pradesh or Maharashtra, such as Bharhut, Sanchi, or Mathura, would have found it surrounded by decorative images of semi-divine female figures, sometimes called Yakshi. To us they appear to be ‘naked’ women, often quite frankly depicted including genitals. This is relatively unusual in South Asian art where the breasts are often clearly depicted but the genitals (for both men and women) are more often obscured. Now, here I must take issue with Kelpie-Cat’s answer. It is naïve to extrapolate from these figures to assume that actual women dressed like this (especially royalty who would be most likely to be depicted using artistic conventions) and in this specific case it is completely wrong. Firstly, the figures are not technically ‘nude’ but rather wearing a transparent garment (it is artistically transparent, it probably wasn’t actually transparent in real life). Secondly, depictions survive of female donors and they wear a heavy dress falling from the shoulder to the ankles which completely obscures all of the garments worn by the Yakshi figures. In other words the Yakshi is depicted using an artistic convention in what amounts to underwear. Even then it is still more complex because we do not know how these figures were painted, or if they were in fact painted. One type of this female figure, known as the Salabhanjika (it just means woman holding a Sala tree), was subsequently adopted in wooden sculptures in Nepal. There is a beautifully illustrated and well written book by Slusser discussing these figures (Slusser M.S. 2010. The Antiquity of Nepalese Wood Carving. Seattle: University of Washington Press) and many of the figures illustrated are painted. The paint has an immediate transformative effect, rendering the figure ‘clothed’ to the viewer. So, we should always be careful to distinguish between how we see art in the isolating context of a museum and how it might have been seen by an ancient viewer before the monochrome ravages of time and within its original context. Now, returning to my point about how South Asia has not single mode of depiction. If our visitor to one of these Buddhist sites had turned north and traveled to another Buddhist site at Taxila, or in Gandhara, or the Swat valley (all in modern Pakistan), to see a contemporary Buddhist site, they would have encountered a very different set of figures. Male figures were almost entirely absent in the south, but they are not uncommon in the north, and in the north they are often nude. By contrast female figures depicted in the same poses at these northern sites are almost always shown with long flowing dresses, clearly clothed. And my example is not hypothetical, people did move between these sites, artists at all of them were familiar with the work of the other sites, and small portable pieces even traveled. Yet two groups of contemporary people chose to take entirely different approaches to how much of the human form they revealed. Lastly I want to agree with Kelpie-Cat’s general point that it is wrong to project a notion that this was ‘progressive’. Art historians have spent a lot of effort and time trying to grapple with what this apparent nudity might mean and I don’t know of a really good discussion (for some random examples see Fischer, K. ‘How were love scenes on Gandharan Stūpas understood by contemporary worshippers?’ South Asian Art 1983, 629-39 or Dehejia, V. The Body Adorned, Sacred and Profane in Indian Art). I have in the past suggested the extreme nudity at some Buddhist sites might reflect a sexualization of the female form which shows the deep discomfort and tensions in contemporary society over the power and authority held by nuns at the time, though there are many other ways of thinking about this and probably the way people thought about it varied as much as the way bodies were depicted.',\n",

       " 'Content Warning: Sexual violence and rape Part 1 but one theme that is brought up is that the average German soldier behaved well towards women in Eastern Europe. Rape was virtually a non-occurrence. That was most certainly not the case. As one historian wrote \"Rape needed no pretext for the Germans on the Eastern Front\" and the amount of children born from these incidents of sexual violence as well as the amount of Soviet persecutions tell a story of rape as a mass phenomenon – one that German military and civlian courts in the occupied territories routinely refused to persecute. As a preface on the difficulty of the topic: The tiny amount of rapes that is reported As every criminologist and sociologist dealing with the matter will tell you, rape is one of the most under reported crimes there are for a variety of reasons, chief among them social stigmatization of the victim and social discourse on sexual violence. Recent studies estimate that only 4-5% of all occurring rapes are reported in the US. For historical societies we are forced to assume the same or an even worse number in terms of reports, more likely worse given historical discourse in the 1940s on the issue. So, reviewing the number of historically reported instances of rape will only ever represent a tiny fraction of all rapes that occurred. The historical context and consent Rape is defined broadly as sexual intercourse without consent of one party. That seems pretty straightforward at first, but the question of consent always involves the context of the relationship between the parties involved. Various lawmakers around the world have introduced laws akin to a statutory rape statute that protects those who can not legally give consent but also offers particular protection to persons in a relationship of dependency because they assume a higher thread of potential coercion in such relationships. Now, when we review the historical context of a liberating and occupying army coming to a territory, this issue becomes a bit difficult in that the relationship between two parties in such a situation is almost never equal. On the one hand you have an army of men with weapons who replace law and order in whatever territory someone lives in. On the other hand you have a population that is in their interaction with the former group very much at the personal mercy of whatever armed member of an occupying army they encounter. Such a relationship is by its very definition unequal and thus the issue of consent – which assumes adults of sound mind and of basically equal relationship to make an informed decision about whether they want to engage in intercourse – becomes muddled. Consider, a women in a country that not only lost a lot if its men in a war but where public order has broken down and completely or partially replaced by an armed occupation is talked into intercourse by a member of the occupying army based on the impression he conveys to her that she needs a protector from other soldiers. Can we in such a relationship where one party holds the potential power over life and death of the other party, whether they use it consciously or subconsciously, assume that consent can even exist? Can this hypothetical woman even make a decision that is not based on implicit or explicit coercion by her hypothetical partner? Research perspective and bias I have previously mentioned the social stigma attached to sexual violence, which is exacerbated by the fact that within this context, the Allied armies came as liberators from Nazism and especially in the case of German women, they were viewed by occupiers and historians alike as part of a group of perpetrators at worst. This form of bias is displayed in that there were very early attempts to establish facts about the sexual violence excreted by the Red Army but little done in regards to the Western Allies. With the Red Army it fitted the narrative and the rate of incidences of sexual violence committed by them was much higher than with Western Allies. The convergence of these two factors leads to the current situation where we have a clearer (although not entirely clear for reasons stated above picture) of the sexual violence committed by members of the Red Army in WWII than in the case of other armies. In a similar vein, historians who would have had the chance to establish a clearer picture in general through techniques such as interviews with victims did not do so because the issue of sexual violence and the stigma attached to it lead to it being ignored for a very long time by many a historian. It was and in part remains a topic inconvenient on some level in both academia and history politics. Researching sexual violence on the Eastern Front, Pascale R. Bos in her article \"Feminists Interpreting the Politics of Wartime Rape: Berlin, 1945\"; Yugoslavia, 1992–1993 Journal of Women in Culture and Society, 2006, vol. 31, no. 4, p.996-1025 cites a German survey from 1942 in which the Wehrmacht estimates that 750,000 babies had already been born from contact between German soldiers and Russian women. This is a conservative estimate and covers only the time frame up to 1942. While not all of these might have come from rape it shows how endemic the problem was. Together with Wendy Jo Gertjejanssen and her PhD thesis Victims, Heroes, Survivors. Sexual Violence on the Eastern Front during World War II, University of Minnesota 2004, the estimation of war time rapes and other incidents of sexual violence inflicted by the Germans in the Soviet Union is somewhere between 2 and 3 million. This lead to historian Nina Tumarkin writing in her book The Living and the Dead: The Rise and Fall of the Cult of World War II in Russia, that the Germans in the east “tortured and murdered civilians at the slightest pretext. As for rape–there was no need for any pretext.” Here, a word about the brothels: not only does the kidnapping and forced prostitution of women certainly constitue rape, these brothels were also part of a system that can only be described as systematic sexual slavery. Frequently ignored by many a historian, Gertjejanssen dedicates a whole chapter of her thesis to the topic of German military brothels and the thousands of victims of their underlying system of state- and military driven sexual slavery. She points out that the Wehrmacht even as far as establishing mobile brothels touring the front lines and averaging 32 visitors between 4pm and 9pm on a normal day. Gertjejanssen estimates that \"During the war Germany controlled at least 569 military brothels throughout the entire Reich in which I believe at least 50,000 women worked.\" The staff of these brothels was recruited in a variety of ways. Gertjejanssen: To begin, they recruited women and girls who were already working as prostitutes and forced them to work on Nazi terms. Some females auditioned or applied to work as a prostitute, believing this could save their own or their family\\'s life. Other women and girls were forced, either by gunpoint or by being given the choice of death or work as a prostitute. New women and girls were constantly recruited. Women and girls forced to serve military men sexually did not always live that long due to illness, pregnancy, suicide, and murder. (...) The Germans established an extensive system of sexual slavery in which women and girls were forced to be sexual slaves for their military machine. The women and girls, many of them from eastern Europe, were expected to perform with the constant threat of murder or concentration camps. When the Germans occupied a village or city they routinely assessed the local population, established ghettos for the Jews, and forcibly recruited able-bodied women and men for labor. In addition to digging trenches, doing agricultural work or being maids, women also were forced to be sexual slaves for the Germans. Very often these women were \"young and pretty\" whom the Germans picked from their well-organized and long lines of local civilians. These assertions of Gertjejanssen are backed with a wealth of evidence, including regimental and divisional orders proving that institutionalized rape at gun point was part of an institutionalized occupational policy of the German Wehrmacht and state.',\n",
       " \"Firstly, let's give a bit of context: in 1995, the bands Oasis and Blur had a rivalry which was very well-publicised in the UK - that they both released singles in the same week, and that obviously only one of the two bands could top the chart (it turned out to be Blur's 'Country House' rather than Oasis's 'Roll With It' which won that battle). This was headline news, covered on the news on British TV etc. The two bands were seen as being the most popular exponents of a pop/rock subgenre, 'britpop', which also included bands such as Supergrass, Pulp, Suede, Ash, and other exponents of what was effectively an updated version of 1960s/1970s pop, and which at the time was seen by many as the UK's answer to grunge. On the back of this, in the UK, Oasis's subsequent album (What's The Story) Morning Glory, released later in 1995, ended up selling about half a million copies in the UK (15x platinum). Even in the days before the streaming services and/or the iTunes music store, this was a lot of copies: it appears to be the highest-selling original album of the 1990s in the UK (the compilation ABBA Gold beats it though, selling 19x platinum, but that's not an original album); only a very small amount of albums have sold more in the UK. What's The Story's success was propelled by several prominent singles, of which 'Wonderwall' was the biggest. Singles in the UK tend to be bought in the first week and so they debut high, and then rapidly fall out of the charts. 'Some Might Say' (the first single from the album) spent 3 weeks in the top 10. 'Roll With It' spent 4 weeks in the top 10. 'Don't Look Back In Anger' spent 5 weeks in the top 10. 'Wonderwall' spent 11 weeks in the top 10. So basically, in terms of why the song became embedded in popular culture, one big reason was that, in the UK, it was the biggest song from the biggest album of the 1990s. So, in terms of wondering why 'Wonderwall' has inspired memes is a bit like wondering why 'Old Town Road' or 'Despacito' has inspired memes - once songs have become that popular, they very often have a life of their own. Elsewhere in the world, Oasis and 'Wonderwall' were less popular, outside of the somewhat-nationalistic, Anglocentric Britpop context of the UK...but still very popular nonetheless. What's The Story sold 4 times platinum in the US (about 4 million copies) - respectable but not quite the sales of Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill (16 million copies) in that country. In Australia, What's The Story was the 4th highest selling album of the year. Nonetheless, in 1995, 'Wonderwall' was a song from a very successful album, and a song that, therefore, a lot of people who were at least vaguely interested in pop culture would have heard across the world. As to the 'anyway here's Wonderwall' meme, it's a relatively easy song to play and sing at a fairly basic level of competency. The actual chords in the song are more complex than the typically 'guy playing Wonderwall in the corner of the party' version, and Liam Gallagher's vocal is obviously a convincing emotional performance which the average guy in the corner might not quite approach...but the song has a relatively small vocal range that's well within the range of most male singers, and as a mid-tempo ballad, it's also relatively easy to play and emote to. It also, lyrically, is obscure (the 'Wonderwall' in the title being a reference to an obscure George Harrison instrumental soundtrack record, Wonderwall Music from the 1960s); this perhaps allows people to give the song their own meaning related to the yearning emotion of the vocal melody. Memes are generally relatively hard to track the origin of, and perhaps the specifics of the Wonderwall memes are a bit beyond the scope of this subreddit, with its 20-year-rule. Some of why things become memes are up to the vicissitudes of randomness; maybe if you rolled the dice again it would have been another song - but in this universe it just happened to be that one. 'Song 2' by Blur also became something of a meme with its simple 'woohoo' refrain being sung by crowds at sports events. But its enormous success in a fairly influential country in the music world, and the characteristics of the song, made it the kind of song that had a larger chance of becoming that meme than probably most other songs.\",\n",
       " 'That’s an interesting question and there are a variety of dates that one could point to, depending on the particular region of Scotland. In the case of south-eastern Scotland around Edinburgh, the Lothians and borders, Old English replaced the local Brythonic language when it was incorporated into the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Bernicia (later Northumbria) in the mid 7th century. By the mid 8th century, Northumbria was well established and was even extracting tribute from the Kingdom of Strathclyde in south-western Scotland. This area fell under Viking influence and then under the control of the Kings of Wessex before Scottish control was established in the 970s during the reign of King Kenneth II. At this point, the MacAplin, Gaelic speaking dynasty ruled and so the court language was Gaelic, but Old English was still spoken in the south-east and Brythonic in the south west. The next key turning point is the reign of King David (1124-1153). His father, Malcolm III, had married Margaret of Wessex and David spent much of his youth at the court of Henry I, marrying Henry’s sister, Maud. Even as heir apparent, he began inviting Anglo-Norman nobles to settle in southern Scotland. Indeed, the first surviving charter from his reign details a large land grant to the de Brus family (a Norman family later to become famous as Bruce). He also established the first “royal boroughs” in Scotland including Berwick, Perth and Aberdeen. The lingua franca in these trading towns was Middle English and it became the language of commerce, although Scottish kings were fluent in English, Norman French and Gaelic throughout the 12th and 13th centuries, with some closer to England and others closer culturally to their Gaelic roots. By the 1370s, Middle English had grown to the extent that Scottish chronicler, John of Fordun, wrote “The manners and customs of the Scots vary with the diversity of their speech. For two languages are spoken amongst them, the Scottish Gaelic and the Teutonic English; the latter of which is the language of those who occupy the seaboard and the plains, while the race of Scottish speech inhabits the Highlands and outlying islands... The Highlanders and people of the islands... are a savage, untamed race, rude and independent.” By this point, Gaelic was on the retreat and, throughout the Stewart period, was eclipsed. In fact, it began to be called “Irish” by lowlanders, who referred to their own language (now known as Scots) as “Scottish”. Scots had become the main language in the towns and at court, whereas Gaelic was associated by many with barbarism. Events such as the response to the Jacobite rising of 1745 and the Clearances further weakened Gaelic-speaking society and depopulated the Highlands. As for how English replaced Scots, many enlightenment figures of the 18th century, such as Adam Smith and David Hume, popularised the notion that Scots was a bastardised form of English and promoted “proper English speech” by which standard English began to replace Scots. By the Victorian period, Scots was already falling out of favour and was increasingly spoken in rural areas, whereas Standard English became the prestige dialect. Tldr: Scots had replaced Gaelic in the lowlands by the mid 14th century and increased in influence over time as it was the prestige language.

Lecturing is certainly one most important parts of being a history professor, but this might vary depending on where you are teaching. Going for a Ph.D. and teaching at a 4-year research university is very different than teaching at a community college with an M.A. If your at a 4-year university, you may have classes of 60+ students, a teaching assistant, and many other duties outside of teaching history (administrative roles, researching and publishing, attending conferences, etc.). If your at a community college, you'll likely have smaller classes (30-40 students), have more time for mentoring, and fewer administrative obligations. I personally wanted to teach at a community college so that I'd have more time interacting with students. Also, one other advantage you may have is that your interested in something other than U.S. history. Assuming you are thinking about teaching in the U.S., there is a shift right now towards including a more diverse curriculum; world history in particular is becoming more popular. Sometimes it takes having a specialty, like Eastern European to get your foot into the door. I was lucky to have studied Californian History in grad school and that was my ticket into a number of institutions. When thinking of where you want to teach, see what colleges and university are nearby and you may be surprised what they teach; I was surprised to see Russian History at a community college, but then heard that the community had a significant Eastern European immigrant population, and a professor who specialized in it, that help make it possible.\",\n",

       " \"The issue with Linear A is not so much deciphering the script, but figuring out what language it is. The general assumption is that the sound values for signs in Linear B line up with the sound values for the equivalent signs in Linear A, which is supported by the presence of some place names in Linear A texts. It is however certainly possible that this is not universally true. The biggest problem here is that the language written in Linear A appears to be an isolate--that is, it does not appear to be related to any other language or language family. So we have nothing to compare it to. The languages in many scripts could be deciphered because because they were members of well-known families and similar to existing languages. For instance, Akkadian as written in ancient Babylonia and Assyria is a member of the Semitic family like Arabic and Hebrew, and as a consequence is well understood today. This doesn't mean it's impossible. We know Sumerian reasonably well despite its status as a language isolate. However, that's in large part because Sumerian was kept alive somewhat similar to the way Latin is and we've found school texts that Akkadian-speaking scribal students used to learn Sumerian. Unfortunately we have no known bilinguals for Linear A. Additionally, most of the texts are accounting, and don't encode a lot of linguistic information. At the same time, there are some later inscriptions on Crete that are in the Greek alphabet but not in Greek. These could be related. The problem here is that there are just a handful of these Eteocretan inscriptions, they're all at least 700+ years younger than Linear A and it's not clear that they actually are related. So most likely no real progress will be made until somebody makes a new find. Andrew Robinson's Lost Languages goes into a lot of detail on Linear A and the decipherment of Linear B and Egyptian hieroglyphics.

       " \"It is very unlikely for two reasons, one related to biology, the other to the history of technology. It is true that copper and its oxides, especially copper (I) oxide have some antibacterial and antiviral properties. Laboratory experiments confirmed that cuprous oxide contributes to the formation of copper–peptide complex and free radical generation that are generally causes of toxicity towards many microbes, especially Echescheria coli, Clostridium difficile or Influenza viruses. This is also likely to extend to other copper alloys and compounds due to the possible leaching of metallic copper. Similar effect was also observed in other metals, especially silver and aluminium. But would working with copper prevent someone from infection, especially from Black Death? Not really, especially in regards to the latter. The plague has been caused by the Yersinia pestis bacterium, but the main vector of the transmission was through the regurgitation of the infected blood by parasites, predominantly fleas, with the airborne transmission being an additional vector, especially in the case of pulmonary form of plague. And while the toxicity of copper oxide towards bacteria is confirmed on direct contact (i.e. when the bacteria are present on the surface covered with oxide), there is no indication that frequent contact with copper compounds would increase the general resistance in regards to the pathogens that have already infected the carrier (you can compare it with water disinfection pills - they can make water drinkable, but swallowing them won't cure poisoning resulting from drinking contaminated water). And walking around with dirty hands is not the best idea, either. Sure, the copper oxide might somewhat help in killing the bacteria on the surface of one's hand, but to be efficient, the layer should consist of copper (I) oxide that quickly turns to less efficient copper (II) oxide and be relatively clear. But in the process of pipe-fitting, hands are usually contaminated with various other substances (grease, dirt) and the amount of actual oxide is too low to make any difference. To make matters worse, copper pipe fitting usually requires the usage of solder that until fairly recently was consisting mainly of lead, being relatively dangerous when ingested. And by 'recently' I mean 1970s and 1980s, as in e.g. USA, lead ceased to be used in water piping only in 1974, and the RoHS limitations of lead-based solder usage in electronics was enacted in European Commonwealth only in 2003. In addition, to prevent tin pest, tin-based solders commonly uses antimony that can form compounds considered toxic or carcinogenic. It is safe in normal usage, but always walking around with dirty hands after pipe fitting is not the best idea. It is true however that making objects used by many people (door handles, railings, tools etc.) of aforementioned metals (or electroplating them) might significantly contribute to reduction of the pathogens transmitted, much like disinfection of such surfaces does. Now, the second problem is the allegation that there were copper pipe fitters around Black Plague, i.e. in mid-14th century. This is largely not true, as copper was not that common material for pipes of any kind either in Middle Ages or Antiquity, chiefly due to its relatively high melting point and general scarcity. Although copper gave its name to Chalcolithic Age and was extensively used in the Bronze Age (also in piping, as evidenced by the pipes in Egyptian temple complex in Abusir dated to 25th century BCE), they were quickly superseded with lead due to far lower melting point and great malleability (later tin was also used in smaller applications, such as organ pipes). Utilization of lead pipes peaked in Roman times and decreased in the last centuries of the Empire period in the wake of the slow decline of Roman influence. In the following centuries, relatively smaller settlements did not have much use for complex waterways. When they came into services in the wake of the urbanization around 12th century, large number of pipes were made of ubiquitous wood (most often than not in the form of bored logs), especially in heavily forested parts of the continent (Tyburn-London waterway built in mid-13th century was initially of this material and also utilized lead piping). Italian cities in 14th-16th century often resorted to the usage of water cisterns, commonly equipped with wood pies for distribution. Ceramic and earthenware pipes, known since millennia and extensively used in ancient Mesopotamia and Indus Valley were quite scarce in Europe, but they definitely existed, as evidenced by the 15th waterway transporting water from Olava river to Vratislav (now Wrocław, Poland). Even with the return of lead as a piping material, as shown in e.g. late medieval waterway of Exeter or the impressive late-17th century pumping system in Versailles, wood piping endured many centuries. For example, municipal water system of Philadelphia was based on hollowed logs in the 1820s and the last part of wooden piping has been decommissioned only in 1859. Thus, the copper pipes were nowhere close to ubiquitous until recently and it is generally doubtful if they were used anywhere around the period of Black Death. They became popular only after the industrialization and technological development making copper more available and allowing efficient mechanical pipe shaping, leading to the popularization of the copper and bronze water piping in 19th and 20th century. High malleability and great heat conductivity also made contributed to the popularity of copper piping in the advent of modern heating systems. But there is a grain of truth in the statement provided with the question although it is quite possible that its author simply mixed up the historical periods. Observation concerning lower incidence of pathological condition among people working with copper was indeed made, but it happened in 1852 and the illness in question was cholera. On that year, Victor Burq, a French physician, noticed that coppersmiths seem to show much lower incidence of cholera than other people living and working in the same area. This led him to experiments that resulted in assumption that presence of copper helps to kill microbes. This was later corroborated by modern research, pointing to antibacterial and antiviral properties of e.g. copper and silver. &#x200B; Kucher, M., The Use of Water and its Regulation in Medieval Siena, in: Journal of Urban History, vol. 31, 2005.

As you observe, for much of the nation's history, Roman Catholicism was heavily feared and vilified by Protestants in the United States, who were hostile to the idea of Catholics holding higher office. Catholicism became much more acceptable in the aftermath of the second world war. Some of the reasons for this have to do with changing attitudes about religion in society, but it also has to do with changes to Catholicism that made it seem less threatening to Protestants. Before the Twentieth Century Protestant hostility towards Roman Catholics did not mean they were unknown in government prior to the twentieth century. Charles Carroll is famous as the only Roman Catholic signer of the Declaration of Independence and was elected in 1788 as the U.S. senator from Maryland. Roger Taney, the infamous chief justice of the Supreme Court who decided the Dred Scott case, was a Catholic. Before becoming Chief Justice in 1836, Taney had been Attorney General and Secretary of the Treasury. Protestants, however, were extremely scared of Catholics in political power. The ratification of the Constitution's provision barring religious tests in public office was controversial in part because of fears of the possibility of a Roman Catholic becoming president. There were even hypothetical arguments advanced in the ratification convention about the idea of the Pope becoming president. Part of the concern of Protestants was that Roman Catholicism was seen as hostile to republican governance. They saw the Pope as a foreign monarch, and Roman Catholics as in submission to his authority, which they worried overrode their loyalty to the United States. There was also an element of racial and ethnic prejudice, as Roman Catholic immigrants tended to be Irish, and later Italian, rather than from England, France, or Germany. The Roman Catholic church also opposed the separation of church and state. In 1864, Pope Pius IX issued the Syllabus of Errors, which declared it was an error that “That the Church ought to be separated from the State, and the State from the Church.” This stoked Protestant fears that Catholics would institute religious control of the country if they gained political power. Al Smith and the 1928 Election In 1928, Al Smith, a Catholic governor of New York, ran as the Democratic candidate for president against Republican Herbert Hoover. Smith massively lost the popular vote and electoral college. Though Hoover was popular in his own right, anti-Catholicism was a huge factor. Smith had trouble competing even in the South, where Democrats had traditionally dominated since the Civil War. Part of the issue was that Smith was opposed to prohibition; a position typically called being a “wet.” Catholics, particularly Irish and Italian Catholics, were often hostile to prohibition, which they saw as an attack on their cultural mores. Hoover’s support for prohibition meant that people could support him without ever directly making their votes about religion. That said, many people were overtly hostile to Smith because of his faith. The Ku Klux Klan apparently had real concerns in the election, and had trouble deciding between a Republican (which they opposed due to the Civil War) or a Catholic. Many Protestant clergymen in the South refused to vote for Smith. Teaching Tolerance There was a major push after World War I to emphasize tolerance and pluralism. In 1927, the National Conference of Jews and Christians (Protestant and Catholic) was set up. This would become the National Conference of Christians and Jews (NCCJ) in 1938. The NCCJ promoted the idea of interreligious cooperation. For example, the group sent out “tolerance trios” of a Protestant minister, rabbi, and Catholic priest to travel the country and give talks about how they all supported each other. Such efforts were controversial with conservatives in all three religious groups, but proved effective. In the led up to World War II, there was what can either be termed an education or propaganda effort by the U.S. government to promote religious cooperation. The tolerance trios toured military camps. The government promoted “Brotherhood Week,” emphasizing the connection between Catholics, Protestants, and Jews. One of the more interesting propaganda efforts centered around the story of the “Four Chaplains.” These were four chaplains, two Protestants, a Catholic priest and a rabbi, who were on the troop ship USS Dorchester when it was torpedoed by a U-boat in 1943. The ship did not have enough life vests, so the chaplains helped as many soldiers as they could, heroically gave up their own vests, and prayed together as the ship sank and they drowned. The government promoted this story as an example of interfaith cooperation. After the war, interfaith cooperation began to center around the idea of a shared “Judeo-Christian tradition.” As the Cold War began, this came to be seen as a counter to atheistic communism. Catholicism was no longer frightening to Protestants; rather, along with Judaism, it could be patriotic. Note: Too long, continued in my reply below.\",\n",

Whilst other contributors can definitely weigh in on the specifics of what happened between 1812-1917 that enabled such a reversal of international relations from the two nations \"across the pond\" so to speak, you might find this thread on the origins of the \"Special Relationship\" as a helpful starting point, particularly regarding the ambiguous origins of it in the 19th century.',\n",
       " 'Short Answer: The success- both immediate and extended- of The Simpsons made it much, much easier for other animated shows aimed at something other than children- although they universally had to be adult comedies- green lit by the suits. Longer answer: People tend to forget that cartoons are incredibly expensive to make- like, we\\'ve spent a century finding new and creative ways to drive cost out of them, some horrifying like Clutch Cargo which super imposed live action mouths over cartoon stills to avoid having to animate the human jaw, some just outright cheap like Hanna-Barbera having virtually all their characters wearing neckties so that they could more easily recycle cells to cut down on costs. Cartoons could certainly dial the quality up to 11- the original Superman Cartoon was one of the, if not the first piece of animation that made use of rotoscoping technology and the quality shows, but Superman also cost millions to produce, in Depression era US dollars As a consequence, you usually only see anyone with the money to finance it green lighting sure bet productions. That\\'s why, for the longest time, the things that got produced were things that were already known to be valuable properties, and they were overwhelmingly targeted at children- you got spiderman and batman and superman because that got butts in seats and sold cheap plastic toys. Even riding on the cultural success of Lord of the Rings, Disney was unable to keep The Black Cauldron at their intended PG-13 rating (although that\\'s a story unto itself). The Simpsons changed everything. Prior to that unless you were named Ralph Bakshi or maybe you were just going to slip something in because you were named Don Bluth you basically didn\\'t see anything targeted at an adult demographic in the US, and unlike, say, a sitcom, there was no such thing as a shoe string budget. Animated productions you were in the tank for, for the better part of a season. But then the Simpsons happens. It seems quaint now, but in an environment where your atypical family sitcom was a live action gig making a sickly sweet vertical slice of middle American life where you might have a single episode that deals with racism or alcoholism with kiddie gloves you instead had an image of middle America that upset then president Bush Sr. Late 90\\'s meant that the Simpsons had spent enough time in continuous production that the mania surrounding it had died down, meaning that any new adult oriented comedy wasn\\'t inherently going to get the \\'Simpsons rip off\\' label, but had also meant that the Simpsons had spent enough time doing victory laps that TV executives eyes did that thing where they turn into dollar bills. You\\'d already seen some shows with moderate success- Duckman managed to stay on the air for four seasons- and that was on cable!- and The Critic was a successful, if critically mishandled property. So by the late 90\\'s you had an aggregation of talent with experience on other animated series, combined with a willingness to fund these projects. And because national TV networks were willing to fund them, you then had cable network channels like MTV and Comedy Network asking, \"What about us?\" Which is where you get South Park, Daria and Beevis and Butthead.',\n",
       " 'This is a question that is still being debated in the study of the USSR. I suspect it won\\'t ever be conclusively answered. But that doesn\\'t mean we can\\'t hack away at it. What do we think of when we say \"empire\", or \"imperialism\"? For most of us in the Anglosphere, it\\'s probably something along the lines of the British Empire, or the French, or maybe the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Probably pre-1917 Russia too, but... oh, I\\'ll get to you. So what do they all have in common? There\\'s a lot of hay you can make about it, but I think the simplest explanation is that they all have a metropole — that is, a center — and a periphery. There are problems with this way of conceptualizing it, for sure; it\\'s aggressively and simplistically binary. But it\\'s a good place to start, and the ways that real empires are much more complicated than that binary opposition are really what your question gets at, so let\\'s start with that and slowly tear it down as we get into more and more depth. At any rate, the rest of what an empire is can sort of be summed up by that divide between metropole and periphery, once you get to understand what it implies. The metropole and the periphery are often divided by an explicit political boundary, and the periphery will probably be divided up with more political boundaries. The people in the metropole are perceived to be profoundly different from the people in the periphery. People can move from either to the other, but in general there is a strong preference for people from the metropole moving, often not permanently, to the periphery, establishing colonies. The people in the center get preferential treatment, maybe as a result of official policy, but maybe not. The metropole exploits the periphery, probably economically. And lastly, the fact that there\\'s a metropole and a periphery means that the thing we\\'re trying to define is probably pretty big, but that\\'s basically impossible to define definitively, so really all it means for now is that... they\\'re big enough to have a metropole and a periphery. Annoyingly circular, but oh well. But that\\'s so vague as to be essentially useless. Basically every possible example you can give that shows the USSR had a metropole and a periphery, or that the people in one were perceived as completely different from people in the other, or that the people in the center had advantages over the people in the periphery — every possible example you can think of isn\\'t really that simple. ___ So first of all, where even is the center, and where even is the periphery, in the USSR? Moscow is pretty clearly the center, and Chukotka is pretty clearly the periphery, but what about Novosibirsk? It\\'s on the other side of the Urals, smack in the middle of Siberia, so that\\'s the Asian periphery, right? But Novosibirsk oblast is, and was, more Russian, demographic percentage-wise, than Moscow. What about Kyiv? It\\'s part of Ukraine now, its people broke away from the USSR because they felt oppressed in it, so it\\'s gotta be periphery, right? But Kyiv is where both Russians and Ukrainians trace their cultural heritage back to. What about St. Petersburg? It was the capital of the Russian Empire before the USSR, so it has to be the center, right? But before 1703 that area belonged to Sweden and was inhabited by Finnic-speaking fisher-people. What about ~~oh, boy, this is a horrible idea~~ Chechnya? But that has as much to do with the Russian Federation as it does with the USSR, so let\\'s get into some specific Soviet policy and think about whether it was imperialist or not. ___ The one thing we can tick off easily is, annoyingly, the least-useful part. The USSR was big. You just won\\'t believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it was. I mean, you may think it\\'s a long way down the road to the apteka, but that\\'s just peanuts to the USSR. But was it big because it was an empire? Well, how much credence do you give Lenin\\'s and Stalin\\'s rhetoric? They reabsorbed the breakaway parts of the Russian Empire in the late 1910s and early 1920s, sure, but in the name of spreading socialist revolution as far and wide as they could. The annexation of the Baltics and creating communist states in Eastern Europe are good counter-examples, sure, but that brought the revolution with it as well — they\\'re counter-counter-examples too. I tend to be pretty credulous that they really believed what they said, even beyond all the evidence their later actions provide, because if you start saying they were just acting deviously in their own interest, you start to get awfully close to all these tired old Orientalist tropes that nobody in the East ever really believes in what they\\'re saying, it\\'s all just maneuvering, intangible like smoke, whereas we here in the West have real ideals and beliefs — and, well, ew. So the USSR was big. But why it was big matters. ___ In the USSR, were the people in the metropole perceived to be profoundly different from the people in the periphery? Well, they were — and they weren\\'t. Lenin and Stalin (and for that matter all their subordinates, who had plenty of agency themselves) believed that national characteristics were innate. The policy of korenizatsiya was designed to encourage all the nations of the USSR to practice their innate cultures freely. Even Khrushchev, who desperately wanted to get away from the shadow of Stalin, subscribed to this general framework. But it\\'s not as simple as that, because even if they thought the peoples of the USSR were profoundly different, they all thought that that could be changed. The entire point of the Soviet project was to create a new kind of man, Homo Sovieticus, to function within their new utopian society, and whether you consider Homo Sovieticus a noble ideal or a derogatory term is an exercise left to the reader. But no matter what you think of it, the USSR was built on the contradiction of assuming that peoples had innate characteristics, and that they could all be shaped into a new mold. Was any one of these peoples ever considered better than any other? Good question. We\\'ll come back to it in a minute. ___ Did the people in the metropole of the USSR colonize the periphery? Large parts of the populations of all the ex-Soviet republics are Russian to this day, but that was the case before the 1917 revolutions as well, which naturally doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s magically okay, but that much the colonial nature of the USSR was something that it inherited. In many ways, it didn\\'t inherit that legacy happily. The Soviet state even offered incentives, nice ones and coercive ones alike, to get Russians to de-colonize what had once been the periphery of the Russian Empire in the 1920s, as part of korenizatsiya. The intent of that policy went much beyond simply removing Russians from Kirgizia and Kazakhstan on a lark. On top of the aims mentioned above, korenizatsiya was also an attempt to create autonomous regions for all of the nationalities of the USSR, where they could all practice their cultures and speak and read in their own languages openly, which I think you\\'ll agree seems pretty impressively committed to undoing the legacy of Russian imperialism. But everyone was still, even at the height of korenizatsiya, required to learn Russian in school as a lingua franca, and education in general still meant education in the culture of the world, which really meant European culture — Beethoven, for example. A girl in traditional Uzbek dress, expressing her own identity openly — but also fully educated and cultured in the highest achievements of world again, read European culture. ___ Did the people in the center get preferential treatment, and did the metropole exploit the periphery, in the USSR? Well, the RSFSR certainly had the highest GDP per capita in the USSR, and it was considered the elder brother in the brotherhood of peoples. People from the periphery commonly moved to the center to find work, and in the center, they often found themselves the target of verbal and social discrimination. Moscow was the capital of the RSFSR and the USSR at once — that proved that the Russians were at the center, right? Well, maybe. Discrimination was never policy in the USSR. It was so pervasive that I can\\'t in good conscience say that it wasn\\'t systemic, but it was never officially approved. The idea of druzhba narodov, \"friendship of the peoples\", was artificially created by the state to explain why the Russians seemed to be better off, but in oral interviews of non-Russian Soviet citizens, an almost constant refrain is that everyone really did believe they were equal and working together in harmony. The RSFSR may have been more urbanized, industrialized, and educated, but it was also deeply engaged in urbanizing, industrializing, educating, and improving the standard of living of the other republics. ___ You have to be very careful here, because this is the moment when Russian ethno-nationalist chauvinists jump you and scream that the Russians were so kind and selfless and benevolent, and then look at what the ingrates gave us in return, they stabbed us in the back! And Russian ethno-nationalists a really unpleasant kind of people. But the annoying thing is, even if their narrative is a massive oversimplification that leaves out a ton of facts, and even if their goals may be morally repugnant, they kind of, maybe, sort of, have a little kernel of a point. The USSR made a commitment, of varying degrees of seriousness over time, to building up the economies of the sister republics, to giving their inhabitants economic and social mobility, and to fighting back against the legacy of Russian Imperialism. ___ So was the USSR an empire? I tend towards no. But, uhhh.... maybe?',\n",
       " 'Perfectly possible. If you are a Roman citizen, you can go where you please. And even if you are not a citizen, you can still go where you please. There are no borders in the Empire, no checkpoints. The \"how\" is simple: money. You need to get there and get settled, and that will cost, especially if you are bringing a bunch of stuff with you. Fortunately you are a merchant and no doubt have some feasible contacts for such a journey. Your route would probably be from a North African port via ship, from Carthage or Utica or somewhere in Tripolitania, or perhaps Alexandria. From there you would probably sail to the Gulf du Lyon, to port at Italica in Hispania, or Narbo / Arelate / Massilia in Gaul. Then it is overland through Gaul on the good Roman roads to the Channel, then a quick passage across to Britain from Portus Itus (near Calais) or Gesoriacum. From Lepcis Magna, central N. Africa, the trip is about 30 to 50 days total. You\\'d be wise to hire some guards for the overland route in Gaul, as well. Gaul is a good little Roman province by the reign of Hadrian, but any road outside civilization is dangerous at the best of times in the ancient world. Better safe than sorry. Once you are there, it\\'s just a matter of starting your new life by finding a service gap and filling it. You will be a stranger wherever you go, which is not ideal in the ancient world, but not insurmountable, especially if you are a Roman citizen. If you want to continue the merchant life, you will need to find an angle, develop some contacts, set up shop. The Roman army would probably be a good bet. You might even leverage your contacts back in North Africa to start up a modest import business for wild animals for the amphitheaters of Britain and Gaul. Roman demand for animals for the arena hunts and games was insatiable, especially in the High Empire.',\n",
       " 'I\\'m not sure about the specifics for some where like the congo but I\\'m more aware about politics of west and east africa then central africa. For the first example the fulani people are wide spread ethnic group in africa (mainly in the west) and it\\'s common for african americans to descend from them because they used to be slave raiders and in exchange many ethnic groups rose up against them and sold them to europeans. But anyway Sunni Ali of the songhai empire committed genocide against these people to kind of extreme (all genocide is extreme) and had fulani that he went to battle with hanged, during this one battle he had hundreds of the fulani war prisoners hanged (based on the stories he seemed pretty terrible and had a lot people killed in general and some historians thinks that this was propaganda and others believe he had bipolar personality disorder) but he a general disgust for these people specifically. The hausa people had city states which were territories of the songhai and pretty much assimilated their culture and looked down on the fulani but hundreds years later the fulani committed jihad\\'s against the hausa and the fulani became superior class for awhile. The hausa had traveled to west africa around 1000 and named their neighbors and the names kind of stuck like the name the yoruba and it was originally yariba which meant \"shady and unreliable\" and the hausa also named the fulani. Sunni Ali controlled the songhai empire by pretty much mass killing of people of other ethnic groups. His successor Askia Mohammed brought peace to all the ethnic groups under the songhai empire. If you were fulani you wouldn\\'t necessarily be liked but a person wouldn\\'t be committing genocide against you. On the east side of the continent the abyssinian empire (mainly amhara people) basically did the oromo people how europeans did to any native people. Like they pushed them out of their land and took it over then the abyssinian raid their remaining villages and sold a lot of them to egypt and then would be sold probably the ottomans. Sense ethiopia was never colonized the amhara remained in control over the oromo and they were treaty like second class citizens. Like in more modern day from 1941 to 1991 they weren\\'t allowed to speak their language in public and amhara language and culture was forced upon them. Like the oromo used to be called galla which is there equivalent to the n word. They had protest last about political injustice against their people back in ethiopia. In southern africa I\\'m not very aware of the relationship but I do know that with the bantu expansion the bantu pushed khoisan/san bushman people (the oldest ethnic group in the world) out of their land which they inhabited for the last 20,000 years. Some people believe through violence and others believe through having a bigger population and just over running them. When europeans first arrived to south africa the bantu ethnic groups told the europeans that they weren\\'t of the same race and so from this the difference in phenotype led this to be the only time europeans went to africa and not consider someone black. There\\'s still some conflict between the San and the bantus living there over who\\'s land it\\'s rightfully is. When not considering the amazigh and arabs and europeans in south africa. You can divide the 3,000 african ethnic groups in to pretty much 4 four larger ethnic groups or variations of african. Which are the bantu which are majority of africans and then there would be nilotic people who tend to be tall and they are the darkest skinned people in the world. Then there would be the cushitic people they mainly live in the horn of africa but there are some people with cushitic dna in other parts of east africa. Then there would be the khoisan/san bushman who are the oldest ethnic group in the world and they kinda have stereotypical asian features and they have the smallest population out of all of these with only a couple hundred thousand people left.

       " \"Taken from my answer to a similar previous question So, firstly, let's explain 'flyting': it's a tradition popular from the medieval era - mentioned everywhere from Beowulf to Chaucer to Shakespeare - of ritualised poetic insult trading. You could certainly see it as being an ancestor of the tradition in rap of freestyle competitions where rappers try to diss each other for the amusement of bystanders (most famously depicted in the Eminem movie 8 Mile). Secondly, let's explain 'rap'; in terms of definitions, a lot of people prefer the word 'hip-hop', because 'hip-hop' denotes a certain culture and set of practices that go together, especially regarding the kinds of music making techniques that go along with the presence of rapping. So you get plenty of 'hip-hop' music that is instrumental, without featuring rap - DJ Shadow's Endtroducing record is entirely based on samples, that were used in a very hip-hop kind of way. It sounds basically like 'rap music' except that there's no-one rapping over the top. And you can get raps in non-hip-hop contexts. The alternative rock band R.E.M., for example, have a song called 'Radio Song' which features a rap from the rapper KRS-One. But you'd be hard pressed to call R.E.M. hip-hop, or even 'rap music'. Which is to point out that rap music is not just about the rapping, and so where there might be an influence of 'flyting', it's specifically an influence on the practice of rapping, rather than hip-hop in general. Anyway, to get from medieval flyting to rap, we need to look at the tradition that more directly influenced rap: 'the dozens'. A recent book by Elijah Wald, Talkin' Bout Your Mama, discusses 'the dozens' at length: it's more or less an extended, elaborate 'yo mama' joke-telling competition. You can get a sense of what 'the dozens' sounds like on this 1959 Bo Diddley track, 'Say Man' which features Diddley and his guitarist trying to insult each other, dozens-style, for fun and profit. The dozens is a very obvious precursor for rap - it's African-American people rhyming, often in a somewhat musical way. And it's likely, says Wald, that Scottish versions of the 'flyting' tradition influenced the dozens, in terms of some of the turns of phrase and rhyming techniques, via Scottish immigrants to America who would have come in contact with African-Americans. However, Wald also points out that ritualised insult trading traditions can be found everywhere from Polynesian atolls to North Africa; 'flyting' in the Anglosphere context is not particularly unique. And Wald argues, much more strongly, that African insult-dueling practices, rather than medieval Northern European flyting, have had much more of an influence on the formation of rap. It's also important to recognise that other forms of spoken word poetry have directly influenced the idea of rapping over music, beyond the 'dozens' tradition. There is a large influence of Jamaican sound system culture in the way that hip-hop has developed - especially in the way it sounds and the way it recontextualises pre-existing records. That culture also has a tradition of 'toasting', where DJs chant in a monotone over the music; as some early hip-hop DJs in New York in the 70s had Jamaican roots, there is an obvious influence of toasting on rap which is separate to the American tradition of the dozens. Similarly, there is also an obvious influence of spoken word poetry, and in particular the quite literary traditions of jazz poetry and beat poetry, on rap. This is most obviously personified in the 1971 track 'The Revolution Will Not Be Televised' by Gil Scott-Heron, and his contemporaries the Last Poets. It doesn't quite have the rhythmicness of rap, but Gil Scott-Heron comes from a more literary tradition involving Langston Hughes's 'jazz poetry' (e.g., this 1958 performance of 'The Weary Blues', where Hughes recites poetry over jazz or perhaps Jack Kerouac's experiments with beat poetry over music If you look at 'Rapper's Delight' by the Sugarhill Gang, it has the Big Bank Hank verse dissing Superman which is obviously influenced by the dozens: I said he's a fairy I do suppose Flying through the air in pantyhose He may be very sexy or even cute But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit I said you need a man who's got finesse And his whole name across his chest He may be able to fly all through the night But can he rock a party 'til the early light He can't satisfy you with his little worm But I can bust you out with my super sperm However, in contrast, the social message in Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's 'The Message' comes from a more obviously jazz poetry/Gil Scott-Heron/Last Poets-esque kind of place. For instance, Duke Bootee, who wrote the lyrics of 'The Message' and rapped on much of it, has a website where he proudly quotes a journalist's comparison of his rapping to Langston Hughes. So yes, scholars have argued that flyting has been an influence on the practice of rap, via the (relatively minor) influence that Scottish immigrants to America seem to have had on the African-American practice of 'the dozens'. However, because 'the dozens' itself is certainly a big influence on hip-hop - but very definitely not the only influence - I don't think it really makes sense to say that flyting is the primary origin of rap. Also, though there's admittedly no evidence of this in primary sources, I know for a fact that yo mama's so old she invented flyting.\",\n",
       " 'Sometimes, fire was used to cauterise wounds. Cautery wasn\\'t a very common practice for wounds as far as we know - one difficulty is that cautery of soft tissues doesn\\'t usually leave a visible trace on the skeleton, so pre-historic soft-tissue cautery is largely invisible in both written records and archaeology. Sometimes, the cauterisation of wounds leaves visible skeletal effects: Antonio Fornaciari, Valentina Giuffra, Valeria Mongelli, Davide Caramella, Gino Fornaciari, \"Cautery in medieval surgery: a unique palaeopathological case\", The Lancet 392, P1111 . https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-673631815-4 in this case, on the skull. Cautery was used in prehistoric dentistry, and Indigenous American use was described by colonial observers, and has also been observed in skeletons: Skinner, M., McLaren, M., & Carlson, R. , \"Therapeutic Cauterization of Periodontal Abscesses in a Prehistoric Northwest Coast Woman\", Medical Anthropology Quarterly 2 278-285. https://www.jstor.org/stable/648816 Heat was applied to teeth in the form of hot sticks, hot flint points, hot resin, and hot iron points. Metal points are of course a relatively recent technology, but the other methods were available for many millennia. More generally, cautery is sometimes used by non-literate \"pre-historic\" peoples for wound treatment, but it is more common in literate \"historic\" populations. Typically, heat is applied using hot metal (usually iron) implements. More common prehistorical treatments for wounds include cleaning the wound and applying poultices. Poultices are often herbal, sometimes with plants known to have medicinal effects, but might be based on or include animal fats or animal parts, dung, or ashes. Sometimes ashes or dirt is rubbed into the wound, but this is often treatment for wounds deliberately caused for scarification, and is intended to promote scarring as well as healing. Smoke is sometimes used in wound treatment - the wound is cleaned and exposed to smoke from a fire. Three important points about cautery are that: It can be effective for stopping bleeding. This works best when a thin heated object is used, minimising damage to the surrounding tissue. An iron needle is excellent; a flint blade or point can work, too. Cautery is not a good way to prevent infection or to promote healing of a wound. It causes damage to surrounding tissue, and burning of the exposed tissue can impair healing. Burning of the surrounding tissue can make infection more likely. Much of the use of cautery (most of its use other than for stopping bleeding, removing growths, and dentistry) is more harmful than beneficial. Its widespread use is similar to the widespread use of blood-letting, which I discussed in https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hut0dr/why_was_blood_letting_used_for_so_many_ailments/ For an overview of some of the side effects, see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4732628/ The goal of cautery in dentistry it to destroy tissue, to destroy the nerves responsible for painful teeth when the are exposed by tooth decay or tooth wear. We have no evidence that cautery quickly followed the use of fire by humans and human-ancestors. The early evidence for the use of fire is unclear, and reasonable estimates for the beginning of the common use of fire by humans vary from about 300,000 years ago to about 1.5 million years ago (i.e., Homo erectus rather than Homo sapiens).',\n",

       " '(1/5) The very short answer is yes, there were strong tensions within the Latter Day Saint movement over who should success Joseph Smith Jr as the spiritual and temporal head of the Church he founded - but it isn\\'t actually possible to focus on the LDS Church in the way you\\'re perhaps looking with your question because the period immediately after his death was marked by an extended period of confusion over the question of how a successor should be chosen and how, and the result is that the major Latter Day Saint denominations that subsequently emerged generally speaking all considered themselves to be the legitimate continuation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. It was not necessarily obvious in the 1840s which \\'wing\\' of the Church\\'s following would emerge, over the course of the following decades, as the pre-dominant force in Mormon religion. Writing the history of Latter Day Saint schism and succession is also complicated by the fact it is a matter of faith who the legitimate successor was to Joseph Jr and the various claimants all have contemporaries who provided evidence and testimony to support the details of their claims, and critics who wanted to disavow those claims. Some of the details of the actual events that surrounded the succession are confused - and the factors involved in different claims and decisions - are contradictory. For example, newly released evidence from a meeting of one of the major pre-1844 decision-making bodies of the Church appear to challenge claims made by the three major leaders of the Church or their supporters after Joseph Jr\\'s death. Having learned the hard way that my answers on Mormonism are likely to attract attention even on old threads I should begin with a disclaimer: I am a practising and believing Mormon, though I do not belong and have never belonged to the main LDS Church, but rather to the second largest Latter Day Saint tradition. As such, I obviously have a personal view on who the rightful successor was to Joseph Jr as the Church\\'s Prophet and President. But I was a historian in training or vocation for the better part of a decade before I converted to Latter Day Saintism, and a historian intimately familiar with the 19th century transatlantic world at that. I want to be clear that as a historian I do not believe - as I will discuss - that there is conclusive evidence that anyone was clearly anointed as Smith\\'s successor, and that there were at least four major candidates who were able to make compelling claims to be the rightful leader of the movement that were in keeping with emerging Latter Day Saint traditions, values and institutional norms. The evidence points clearly to a period of contest and confusion with multiple viable claimants to the leadership of the Mormon faith. I will return to my own personal views on the succession at the end of my answer for those interested in understanding how my historical knowledge intersects with the convictions of my faith. To understand the leadership struggle that followed Joseph Jr\\'s death, it\\'s important to first understand the particular role that he occupied within the hierarchy of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (which for now I will just call \\'the Church\\'), how he came to occupy that role, and the tensions that were already begin to arise around his leadership during his lifetime and especially on the eve of his death. Although the Church was formally constituted and declared on April 6th 1830, it is not entirely clear when the Restoration - the name that Latter Day Saints themselves give to their collective movement and family of churches today, referring in traditional Mormon belief to the idea that Latter Day Saintism represents a literal and/or moral reinstatement of the beliefs and values of the earliest Christians - movement began. The traditional view among Latter Day Saints is that the movement began sometime in 1820 when Joseph Jr, then a 14 year old boy, went into the woods behind his family home to pray for clarity on who he should listen to in matters of faith. There Joseph Jr claimed he had a vision of Jesus Christ, who forgave him of his sins and told him that there was no church on Earth anymore that preached the authentic Gospel any longer. Whether or not this First Vision as Mormon tradition calls it happened is a matter of faith - but from an historical perspective, no first or second hand account of it is recorded anywhere before 1832, and the people involved in Joseph\\'s early life were his working class family and neighbours, meaning we have precious little documentary evidence of his pre-Church life contemporary to it. Most probably Joseph began to have serious thoughts about religion and his role in the world spiritually for the first time in 1823. In later accounts of his life, this is when Joseph Jr reported that an angel called Moroni first appeared to him to tell him of ancient golden plates buried in the Earth which he was to be given the power to translate and share with the world (which would become the Book of Mormon). Joseph\\'s mother recalled around the right time having a discussion in the family on which churches were and were not theologically sound and spiritually legitimate, although she also seemed to be confused later in life in her accounts of the First Vision and the Moroni visitation. In any event 1823 seems like a sensible place to begin the history of the faith that satisfies all: for the orthodox Mormon it is the moment Joseph Jr is explicitly given his first mission from the divine; for the Latter Day Saint who believes the Book of Mormon to be a divinely inspired parable for the 19th century it suggests 1823 was the moment Joseph Jr first felt his calling; and for those of other faiths or none it is a sensible point for identifying when the idea to write the Book of Mormon must have began to form in Joseph Jr\\'s head. Real or imagined, the Moroni visitation is what first sets Joseph apart from other claimants to visions from God in 19th century Christianity within a Mormon theological context. To compare with the history of the other great enduring continuing revelation tradition within mainstream Christianity, the Quakers, the First Vision was the equivalent to George Fox hearing a quiet whisper in his soul; the Moroni visitation was the Mormon version of Fox on Pendle Hill being told he would gather people from across Lancashire to do great work in God\\'s name. Work on the actual Book of Mormon began in September 1827, ostensibly after another visit from the angel Moroni. The only thing we know for certain about the golden plates Joseph reported to recover was that there was some kind of physical artefact other contemporaries interacted with and saw being transported. But here was the primary claim to Joseph Jr\\'s prophetic mantle: only he was allowed to see the plates by divine commandment and only he given the ability to translate from the language they were written. Over the next few years Smith began to attract a small following of supporters and interested parties, and the vast majority of the Book of Mormon was completed in a short period of time in 1829. According to Mormon tradition the Church was established spiritually in this period first by the baptism and calling to the priesthood of Joseph Jr and his scribe and devotee, Oliver Cowdery. This was the second pillar of Smith\\'s legitimacy in the eyes of his later followers: he was the first member and first priesthood holder in the Restoration. The Book of Mormon was published and sent to print in early 1830 and on April 6th, Smith\\'s early followers met to form what would eventually become the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (then just \\'Church of Christ\\'), where the third pillar of his leadership was established. On the day of the Church\\'s founding, Joseph Smith Jr related a message from God to his followers. This message is now held in the third book of sacred scripture that nearly all Saints recognise called Doctrine and Covenants (D&C), although the D&C itself wasn\\'t organised a cohesive volume until 1835. In this message Smith reported that God had called him to be \"a seer, a translator, a prophet, an apostle of Jesus Christ, an elder of the church ... being inspired of the Holy Ghost to lay the foundation thereof, and to build it unto the most holy faith\" and that God wished for the Church to \"give heed unto all Joseph\\'s words and commandments, which he shall give unto you, as he receiveth them ... ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith\". Joseph was set aside as a unique channel of communication between the earthly Church and the divine. Over the course of the next 18 months, Smith\\'s role was refined and elaborated by additional revelations that clarified only he could speak for God within the Church and his position as the primary and ultimate leader of the faith clarified. He was both President of the Church and the Prophet of the Restoration. Other institutions of leadership were established and democratic decision-making was encouraged within parts of the emerging Church apparatus, but by the end of 1831 Smith\\'s authority and role were quite well cemented. By 1835 the modern Church leadership structure was established: Smith as the Church\\'s Prophet and President at the top, supporting by two or more deputies (the First Presidency), and a Council of Twelve senior priests mimicking Christ\\'s calling of twelve apostles.',\n",
       " 'It appears that humans (and at least some other primates) easily learn fear of some animals, such as snakes and spiders, and can easily learn fear of cockroaches, due to their sudden appearance and rapid movement. Being surprised and startled by cockroaches can lead to fear of cockroaches, which can result in disgust and loathing. Our perception of cockroaches as living in garbage and filth aids that disgust and loathing. The \"attar of roaches\", the distinctive and unpleasant aroma produced by some species doesn\\'t help humans like them. Thus, dislike and disgust are common modern responses to cockroaches. However, these are not universal responses (just as they aren\\'t universal responses to snakes and spiders). There is a broad spectrum of attitudes to cockroaches. Apart from the disgust and loathing you note in your question, there is non-disgusted dislike of them as an annoying household pest. There has been treatment of them (e.g., in parts of Russia and Eastern Europe) as benevolent and useful inhabitants of the household, bringing wealth and prosperity. Sometimes this was specifically due to cockroaches increasing the fertility of one\\'s livestock. When moving to a new house, efforts would be made to move as many of the cockroaches as possible from the old house to the new. (In some parts of Croatia, snakes had a similar beneficious and protective reputation.) This type of attitude might only apply to some species of cockroaches (e.g., black cockroaches) while others (e.g., brown cockroaches) were regarded as annoying pests. In some places, cockroaches have a long history of being food for humans. Two notable places where they are eaten today, following long tradition, are Mexico and Thailand. They are farmed for food in China, but the most Chinese cockroach farming is aimed at their use in medicine, and culinary use is a minor part of the industry. Cockroaches don\\'t have a good image in China, so the farmers don\\'t widely advertise what they are raising. Sometimes, incidents such as as the escape of about 1 million cockroaches from one farm attract some media interest. (How many farmers can tell stories of how 1 million of their livestock escaped in one day?)

       " 'While there is a body of European literature dealing with travel and trade in Chinese waters (and the 17th century Dutch tended to write a lot more than the Portuguese of the 16th century), the Chinese state rarely wrote about the pirates of their own people, since they held the pirates in disdain. Thus there are not many accounts of Chinese pirate life from their own point of view around the time of the Portuguese arrival. That being said, I can name a few modern studies of the politics of the period: Tonio Andrade, The Gunpowder Age Andrade has a chapter or two about the first Sino-Portuguese battle, including how Ming China learned about the European guns through the Chinese crewmen on the Portuguese ships Roderich Ptak, China\\'s Seaborne Trade with South and Southeast Asia, 1200-1750 Roderich Ptak, China, the Portuguese, and the Nanyang Ptak is a very prolific author writing about Chinese maritime networks, having an output of more than 40 books and countless articles on the topic.

       " 'In addition to the above answer I can offer you one unique example of a young woman giving up her religious vows. Christina Carpenter became an anchoress in the small village of Shere in Surrey, England in the first half of the 14th century. An anchorite (male) or anchoress (female) is a person who takes a vow of stability and is attached to a church in a cell with no exit, literally built into the wall of the church where they would live until death. It was a fairly extreme expression of devotion but one that came with certain amounts of prestige and power, particularly for women who may not have the same opportunities to gain religious authority as men. People would travel to seek wisdom from an anchoress and they could become pilgrimage sites in their own right. A famous example of an anchoress is Julian of Norwich the author of Revelations of Divine Love. Anyway, Christina Carpenter is interesting because her cell was built on to the outer wall of St James\\'s church in Shere, where she just had a portal to receive food, speak to visitors and receive the body and blood of Christ during mass, but, after an unspecified amount of time she wanted to leave. And so, she left. The wall was broken down and she returned to live the life of a lay person. However, the reason we know this is because we have a letter written declaring that she wished to be readmitted into the cell. The bishop who was the recipient of the letter agreed that she could be readmitted to the cell if she completed some penance, as long as this time, she remained in the cell indefinitely. Records suggest the second cell had smaller holes and a squint that could be used to see the altar during services. We don\\'t know what happened to Christina after this, but we do know that she took an extreme religious vow, changed her mind, and then, changed her mind again back in favour of the vow. One has to wonder, if it was possible, though punished with penance, to break a vow where you have declared yourself \"dead to the material world\", it may have been possible to do the same in other monastic contexts.',\n",
       " 'Nine hundred ninety-five. That\\'s how many cases related to people leaving or switching religious communities that we know were reported to the pope from just two dioceses in 15th century Germany (Augsburg and Constance). That includes monks, nuns, and other religious asking permission to leave; ones who left asking permission to return; and cases involving people who left and were caught. The supplication letters also cover cases of people who were caught out on a temporary lark (running off to a tavern or brothel for a night), left for longer, or wished to switch from one community to another, which was a violation of monastic rules as well (\"stability\" was another vow). It includes people asking permission to leave, and superiors asking permission to kick them out. It\\'s necessary to include all of those cases because one type of situation could easily be spun into another in hopes or more lenient or harsher treatment. So yes: contrary to some earlier answers in this thread, it was both possible and done to break monastic vows in the Middle Ages. It must be said first, though, that your proposed scenario of leaving to take care of your parents is unlikely. If you\\'re concerned about their aging and their ailing health, the best thing you can do for them is...stay in your convent! Religious houses were the best and swankiest retirement communities and nursing homes in the western Middle Ages. Plus, people hoped it would provide them an advantage in the afterlife admissions and placement competition. And one major reason for a family to support the entrance of a child into religious life (i.e. pay the monastery) was to maintain a relationship with that house--it was by no means a guaranteed thing. (Quick terminology note: when I use \"religious x\" here, it refers to monks, nuns, and others who took religious vows--religio for most of the Middle Ages referred to \"rule\"/way of life, in the sense of following a monastic Rule. I\\'m also using monastery and convent interchangeably--the difference is NOT gender, it\\'s what order people belonged to, so just read either word as inclusive.) In the papal letters and other topical sources, like example stories to warn readers away from leaving religious life, there are a variety of oft-repeated reasons for leaving cloister. Some were quite licit (and could thus be used as an excuse for people with other motives): permission to go on a specific pilgrimage; wanting to move to a house with stricter rule enforcement. Another set of licit reasons was pragmatic: conflict within the community; needing to flee a specific location for safety during wartime. There were also the cases that could become licit, for example, a family wishing their daughter or prospective daughter-in-law to enter an advantageous marriage. Enough money and political clout could find some irregularity or other in the original vows. (It seems likely that many of these cases, though not all, would be involuntary departures.) And then there were the salacious details that anticlerical late medieval and Reformation polemic just loved, about monks keeping secret families and nuns being hypocrites and so forth. Did this happen? Sure, sometimes. Alexander Murray talks about one eleventh or twelfth century (I think twelfth) abbot who, when forced to cut himself off from his extracloister \"wife\" and children, committed suicide. Was it as common as early Protestant polemicists liked to say? That...would not be possible, haha. How to make your escape? As the papal supplication letters indicate, there was always the tried-and-true, but not guaranteed, method of asking for permission and receiving it. You could also go on pilgrimage and just...never come back. Some monks were assigned to go to university to study law or some such, to help their house in the future--living in the world or in the cloister afterwards. (Yes, university students included monks who were technically vowed to spend their entire lives in one place.) This, of course, was not an option for women. But most importantly, monastic cloisters were not prisons (except when they were used as such for individual criminals--Joan of Arc\\'s original sentence was perpetual confinement in a convent). Even for women, the strictest claustration is associated with the early modern era and maybe some 15th century Observant (i.e. monastic rules levelled up) houses. Members went on errands to procure food, beg for alms (i.e. collect donations), and so forth. There were plenty of chances to, like pilgrimage, just forget to return. Hence the ambiguity in recorded cases between \"left temporarily\" and \"left/tried to leave for good.\" Very easy to spin either one of those into the other. As for consequences for leaving, whether or not you were caught? The primary problem with life after fleeing a cloister was the high potential for poverty. Monks (who, by the later Middle Ages, were all priests) could not work as priests-for-hire, since they were forbidden to officiate sacraments and perform other religious duties (and would have no one to vouch that they were ordained). Cities did have substantial populations of never-married women, not to mention widows, but they were overwhelmingly lower class--servants, laundresses, manual laborers. Getting caught brought its own world of problems, and I\\'m not talking about corporal punishment--that was par for the course for infractions in day-to-day life, especially in monasteries. (Laugh too often? Whisper a snarky comment during communal prayers?) So were punishments like extra fasting days or labor duties for a time. For larger infractions, you could look forward to more severe fasting limitations, harsher duties, separation from other community members, loss of any kind of rank within the community, and so on. And that\\'s assuming they let you back in at all, instead of forcing you to stay excommunicated. In other words: hellbound.',\n",
       " \"My normal disclaimer that I have a doctoral degree in law, taxation, and specialty in history of the Common Law, but I have read widely on the French Revolution (which gave life to this quote) and revolutions in general. To begin, the original quote is “A l'exemple de Saturne, la révolution dévore ses enfants,” which translate to “Like Saturn, the revolution devours its children.” Goya’s painting would come some thirty years later, but it does give a visceral feeling of the line. This was from a publication in 1793 by Jacques Mallet du Pan, a royalist and anti-revolutionary, so while not presaging the general violence of the revolution, it probably presaged the Terror, depending on one’s starting point for the Terror proper. (Source in original French facsimile: https://archive.org/details/considerationssu00mall_0/page/n3/mode/2up). The Terror was, as your probably know, when the French Revolution’s foremost symbol, the guillotine, became insatiable, and factionalism fed Danton’s head through its maw, followed by Robespierre, and many many others notable but who need not be mentioned here. Revolutions tend to devour their children because once the immediate matter of overthrowing the preceding power structure is accomplished, the people involved with that overthrow tend to begin realizing that they do not have identical (or even similar) ideas of what should replace it. Once the group (or a coalition of groups bound by an immanent and tangible goal) achieves their goal, factions either develop or reappear. The French Revolution was fomented in large part by a vast number of clubs and later factions or parties that worked together initially, then became bitter rivals for solidifying power in the vacuum left by the regicide. Danton, for example, may have coined the Terror by legislatively instituting “terror as the order of the day.” (See, e.g, https://revolution.chnm.org/d/416/). Robespierre and Saint-Just, afraid of the Dantonists (as Danton’s group was called) would take power from their group, the Jacobins. Even earlier, all three had conspired together to destroy another group, the Girondists. The Irish War of Independence provides another great example of those (Modern Ireland by R.F. Foster is an accessible gem that handles that period in the context of a holistic view from 1600-1972). The Irish War of Independence concluded with Michael Collins and company entering into the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which created the Irish Free State recognized by Great Britain, but which came with the rather controversial caveat that members of the new Irish legislative body must take an oath of allegiance to the sovereign of the United Kingdom. (Text of the Treaty at https://www.difp.ie/volume-1/1921/anglo-irish-treaty/214/#section-documentpage). This immediately caused the Irish Civil War, fought by pro-treaty and anti-treaty forces. The pro-treaty forces, probably most visibly embodied by Michael Collins, argued that the Treaty was necessary for a war they were not necessarily winning, and as such gave the Irish Free State the “freedom to gain freedom.” The pro-treaty forces were therefore a coalition itself: some thought the goal had been achieved, and opposed further fighting; others thought that practical necessity demanded entering into the treaty or losing entirely. Anti-treaty forces were even more diverse, going from simply nationalists that disavowed any connection to the UK, to socialists like Peadar O’Donnell, and an assortment of other small idiosyncratic group. The Irish Civil War was particularly tragic because of how personal the split between pro- and anti-treaty persons was. Comrades-in-arms were quite suddenly fighting to the death. Michael Collins is believed by some to only have been successfully assassinated when he was because an anti-treaty Irishman recognized him from serving with him during independence, and put together an ambush out of knowledge of his value. (Liam Neasy, Brother Against Brother). Even the United States, which has historically been held as a rather peaceful Revolution, certainly cannibalized both its ideals and its people, specifically through the creation of political parties. Washington made an immense effort to make the coalescing parties have a stigma, most notably in his Farewell Address. The creation of parties necessitated rapid amendment to the Constitution, such as the Twelfth Amendment—the electoral college had to distinguish between votes for president and vice-president or else there would be an extreme and unanticipated tension since the two-party system, even nascent, would cause opposing parties to occupy each post. You also have famous cases of the Burr-Hamilton duel, which embodied the sort of tension that had built in Washington between the Federalists and the Democratic-Republican Party. The short answer appears to be that it is easier for a diverse group of people to band together in the unity of wanting to destroy something, and much, much harder to keep those same people together to build something new when they have all known violence and a desire for power.\",\n",
       " 'Hi there -- the 1619 Project is a multimedia project by the _New York Times Magazine_ that was published in 2019, on the 400th anniversary of what we believe to be the first African slaves brought to the Americas. The project is meant to make an argument about re-imagining and re-centering American history around the arrival of enslaved people in the Americas, rather than histories that center American history around the arrival of white people in America. The goal of the project is to provoke critical thinking about why we tell the history of the United States through the lens of the European colonizers, rather than the oppressed people who were brought with them (much less through the lens of the people who were already here and were destroyed by genocide by colonizers.) The 1619 project does include school curricula that teachers can choose to use in their classrooms. My esteemed colleague /u/edhistory101 has written about 1619 before, here and here The 1776 Project was a Trump administration effort to refute the 1619 project and re-center history around the traditional founding of the United States (1776 being the date of the Declaration of Independence, though the revolution started with the fighting at Lexington and Concord in 1775). The project was taken off the White House website about 14 minutes after Biden became president; it was/is a very whitewashed, 1950s-style retelling of American history that centers it on white people.

       " 'I\\'ve been doing this long enough to never say definitively \"It would never happen\", but the clip does go a a little over the top. There are similarly plenty of instances of tanks actually getting so close to the enemy that they become intermingled, with the wrecks of both sides of the battle being right next to each other, so it stands to reason that the crews would similarly be in close proximity. See for example this image, the wreckage of two American M3 gun motor carriages (Tank destroyers) in between the wreckages of a German Panzer IV and Tiger. Survivors could well find themselves within ten meters of each other if the Americans had stayed with their vehicles for cover. It starts out reasonably enough. There have certainly been instances where opposing sides seeking shelter from the maelstrom of battle suddenly find themselves sharing the same foxhole or building or whatever, leading to either an immediate truce between them or an immediate fight to the death. The scene in the movie sees the melee start after a group of Germans, on fire, head for water, only to discover Russians there too. However, the fight then devolves into other tankers coming -to- the fight. Again, it\\'s difficult to be definitive. The primary goal of an unhorsed tanker is to leave the battlefield and go find another tank, not to play infantry, a task for which he is ill-trained and ill-equipped. However, unit loyalty is also a thing, so if you see your colleagues or friends fighting for their lives in a melee, I could well see other tank crews finding this principle overruled and heading in to the fight. So.. plausible, yes. Common, no.',\n",
       " 'In 1835 Lord Chancellor Lyndhurst introduced the bill to correct an earlier ambiguity in the law. The existing law about marriages within \"prohibited degrees\" (so family and family in law, as well as the sister of your deceased wife) was based on a law from 1533, under Henry VIII. This law stated that a marriage within prohibited degrees could be annulled at any time by the Ecclesiastical church. Any children from the marriage would become illegitimate. Lyndhurst argued that this created insecurity and inconvenience for the married couple and their children. His special motive was to protect the seventh Duke of Beaufort, who was in such a marriage, and his son, who would inherit his estate. To solve this issue, parliament passed an edited form of Lyndhursts bill. All marriages with a deceased wife\\'s sister (DWSM) up to 1835 were considered valid. All such marriages from that year on were prohibited. Starting in 1835, this bill was debated almost annually, before being finally revoked in 1907. This was reverenced in the Gilbert and Sullivan opera Iolanthe as \\'pricking the annual blister\\'. Some years it passed the House of Commons but was stopped in the House of Lords. During these years, the issue was hotly debated in the public sphere by use of pamphlets, literature and papers. In fact, the bill was part of a much larger debate about society versus the individual, how much the law could intervene in an individual\\'s life, and the purity of marriage. The bill was used to argue about the ability of government to legislate morality, control individual behavior, and regulate the family. In a way, the yearly debating of this bill helped Victorian society to shape and determine itself. Obviously, being discussed over so many years, there is an incredible amount of arguments in favor and against, not all of which I\\'m going to name in this comment. Here are a few examples: Arguments in favor of the bill (and against DWSM) The Victorian era looked upon incest differently then we do. It was thought that man and wife, upon marrying, became actual family. There was no difference between blood relations and in-laws in term of nearness. Since the wife is now family, so is the sister. To then marry the sister was considered incest. There was a big taboo on incest, and a focus on seeing the bond between brother and sister as pure and not \"tainted by passion or irregular desire\". The argument was that the bond between brother-in-law and sister-in-law should be similarly pure. (The article by Nancy F. Anderson goes quite extensively into the fact that incest between brothers and sisters was probably fairly common and the lines between sibling-love and romantic love were sometimes blurry. The article is quite old and arguably some theories are dated. I still want to mention it but invite you to explore this aspect on your own.) There was a biblical argument, though through the years the passages were interpreted differently. In the early years arguments in favor of the bill cited Genesis 2: \"man and wife become one flesh\" and Leviticus 18:16, which prohibits to \"uncover the nakedness of thy brother\\'s wife.\" By 1870, science replaced religion in the debate. It was claimed for example that sexual intercourse changes the physiological makeup of the marriage partners and makes them blood relations, which again makes the sister in law a blood relation. Lastly, there was the fear of gliding scale effect (still very popular in current politics): if this law would be revoked, other marriages within prohibited degrees might follow. There was a fear of opening the floodgates to \"unnatural\" marriages. &#x200B; There were also arguments against it: Rich people could take their wife\\'s sister abroad (usually Scotland) and get married there. We have examples of this happening. Poor people could not, therefore the bill was felt to discriminate. In the later 19th century, there was a strong focus on caring for the poor, by making bills, charity, banning child labor etc. So this argument fits into that sentiment. Oftentimes unmarried sisters would already be living with a family or with a widower. Especially poorer families would not be able to afford other childcare. Poorer people lived in small quarters and often shared bedrooms. DWSM would help these people to live decently instead of in sin. Opponents also claimed that marriage did not cause a blood-relation but only a psychological connection, which would make the marriage allowable. The validated marriages prior to 1835 were also brought out as an argument. &#x200B; The bill had been revoked in many of England\\'s colonies around 1880, and its final downfall started in 1906 with the Colonial Marriage Act, which granted full inheritance rights to children from deceased wife\\'s sister marriages from the colonies, in England. This bill paved the way for the final revoking of the Wife\\'s Sister Bill. In 1908, a new Punishment of Incest Act took its place, but this bill only prohibited sexual relations with mothers, daughters, sisters, granddaughters. Sisters in law were not mentioned in this law. &#x200B; An interesting note: Vanessa Stephen, sister of Virginia Woolf, fell in love with her half-sister Stella\\'s widower Jack Hills. There\\'s a line in Mrs. Dalloway about how \"no decent man should let his wife visit a deceased wife\\'s sister\". &#x200B; Sources consulted & further reading: The \"Marriage with a Deceased Wife\\'s Sister Bill\" Controversy: Incest, Anxiety and the Defense of Family Purity in Victorian England, Nancy F.

       " 'There\\'s an implication of a misconception in your question that I think is addressed by the appendix to William Page Wood\\'s 1859 speech on the topic: The state of our law is singularly misunderstood, not only \"out of doors,\" but by many members of Parliament. It is supposed that because the marriage with a wife\\'s sister was voidable only, and not void until Lord Lyndhurst\\'s Act, there was a species of half sanction to such unions. Now, the fact is, that no such marriage was ever in the smallest degree sanctioned; but the Courts of Common Law would not allow any proceeding in the Ecclesiastical Court to set them aside after the death of either party, so that after the death of husband or wife there was no mode of obtaining a judicial decision, and of course all marriages actually solemnized are good till such sentence is given. The best mode of making this understood is to call attention to the case of marriage with a man\\'s own sister or mother, being in precisely the same position, and in the same sense voidable only, not void. That is, while the 1835 act made it illegal to contract such a marriage, it had always been considered invalid under English common law for a man to marry the sister of his wife - and for a man to marry his brother\\'s wife. It\\'s just that it was previously more like grounds for annulment, someone would have to say, \"hey, by the way, judge, my marriage was made on an illegitimate basis, please invalidate it,\" if they wanted to end it. After the act - or, actually, in Scotland from 1567 on - it simply couldn\\'t happen/wasn\\'t considered a real marriage. Ginger Frost cites the specific 1859 case of Fenton v. Livingstone in Living in Sin: Cohabiting as Husband and Wife in Nineteenth-Century England: the first wife of Thurstanus Livingstone (yes) died and in 1808 he married her sister, subsequently having a son with her; in 1832, his second wife died without ever going to court to have the marriage voided. After Livingstone died, his son inherited land from him in England and Scotland, but the Scottish courts refused to allow him his inheritance because, by their standards, his parents had never been married and he was illegitimate. The basis for the prohibition against these kinds of marriages was the Bible, actually. Leviticus says that a man may not marry his sister, and in marrying a man and woman were considered \"one flesh\", so therefore a wife\\'s sister and a husband\\'s brother were as close to you as your own sister or brother from birth. It was as incestuous to marry them as it would be to marry your own sibling or parent. And there was concern about incest in general in Victorian England, although it was nearly always phrased to be about patronizingly looking down on the foibles and sins of the poor. For instance, there was an idea that incestuous sibling behavior was encouraged and made common by the fact that poor families were crushed into small apartments together - something that obviously wouldn\\'t happen to the middle and upper classes, so therefore we don\\'t need to think of them ever practicing sibling incest (or abuse). Investigative reformers also found that men pursued their wives\\' sisters even while their wives were alive, particularly in those overcrowded conditions. Some took it as a given that working-class men whose wives died would take in her sister to help them with the house and children, and that likewise, the closeness of the small house would encourage them to have sex, which was a problem from both the incest angle and a premarital sex angle. In Bracebridge Hemyngs\\'s (yes) \"Extra Volume\" of London Labour and the London Poor , while he\\'s sympathetic to people in this situation and opposed the ban so that they could marry, he still calls it \"cohabitant prostitution\". However, the simple fact is that studies of the period showed that it was overwhelmingly middle-class men who wanted to incestuously marry their wives\\' sisters. Supporters of the ban, like William Page Wood, could point out that Hemyngs\\'s patronizing concern for the poor was on very shaky ground, and that it was important to guard the morals of all England, including the corrupted middle- and upper-class families - but the reason there was so much debate over it in Parliament between 1835 and 1907 is that quite a lot of unstigmatized, affluent, non-working-class widowers wanted to marry their sisters-in-law. (And in fact, a large number of these marriages still occurred between 1835 and 1907 despite the ban, the people involved typically getting around the law by traveling abroad to do it.) At the same time, marrying the wife of your deceased brother was still seen as incredibly taboo, so taboo that it did not need to be included in the 1835 act or debated in the halls of government. The debate over the ban works to conceal the complete acceptance to the reciprocal cultural prohibition.',\n",
       " \"Depression, in its presently accepted clinical form might not have been necessarily known prior to its formulation in the early 20th century, but various psychological and psychosomatic conditions to large extent compatible with the depression as we know it are known and recognized as a condition for several millennia. Regardless of the character, attributed causes and methods of healing, we can state with substantial certainty that the symptoms of depression and other psychological conditions have been known and addressed for a very long time. I will limit myself to the periods preceding the actual development of the modern understanding of depression in late 19th and 20th century, as it is not really that related to topic due to the common acknowledgement of depression in medical community within that period. The oldest texts speaking of the conditions that could be construed as depression according to the DSM-5 or ICD-11 (modern psychological diagnostic manuals) come from the Ancient Mesopotamia. For example, a text catalogued under the signature AMD 8/1 8.6 speaks of the following situation that bears a resemblance to a clinical depression. He develops sadness/his spirit is low/he says 'woe' and shouts 'alas!'/his appetite for food and drink wanes, so does his need to go towards a woman, his spirit does not lead him to a woman/he says 'have pity on me'. In this case the word rendered as 'spirit' is libbu that much as the word temu refers to an immaterial, divine part of the human being, similar to concept of 'soul', 'reason' or 'spirit' (please note the German word 'Geist' is still used to denote psyche and spirit both as the human soul and apparition from beyond the grave). Likewise, another text from the same region, suggested to be written somewhere in 16-17th century BCE and presented under the signature BAM 234 by Köcher. The original text goes as follows (English version after Reynolds and Wilson): If the head of a household has had a long spell of misfortune – and he does not know how it came upon him – so that he has continually suffered losses and deprivation (including) losses of barley and silver and losses of slaves and slave-girls, and there have been cases of oxen, horses, sheep, dogs and pigs, and even famiy members dying off altogether; if he has frequent hip libbi (lit. 'breaking of the spirit', possibly a nervous breakdown), and from constantly giving orders with no one complying, calling with no one answering, and striving to achieve his desires while having to look after his household, he shakes with fear in his bedroom and his limbs have become “weak”; if because of his condition he is filled with anger against god and king; if his limbs often hang limp, and he is sometimes so frightened that he cannot sleep by day or night and constantly sees disturbing dreams; if he has a “weakness” in his limbs from not having enough food and drink; and if he forgets words, then, as for that man the anger of gods is upon him. Please note that the description of the condition is quite consistent with the common underlying causes of the exogenous (reactive) depression disorder, i.e. one resulting form intense, combined or prolonged stressors (most often than not combination of all three), such as financial loss, death of relatives, perceived lack of respect or failure to meet one's standards and resulting feeling of inferiority or inadequacy. This is followed with clinical symptoms, starting from anxiety, exhaustion, insomnia or lack of focus and even including severe ones, such as hallucinations, noticeable mental deterioration or lack of appetite leading to malnourishment. In other words, Mesopotamian text quoted above presents detailed if very severe (possibly in an attempt to show all known symptoms at once, maybe as a kind of medical instruction) description of a clinical depression. In both cases presented above, much like in other, similar to these, what we would call today psychological condition was eventually attributed to the influence of the gods, although the actual external stimuli also played a role in the development of the illness. Methods of healing associated with the conditions were pretty much limited to the religious rituals, incorporating prayers and offerings. Symptoms of depressive disorder were observed also by the Greek scholars, such as Aristotle and Hippocrates, who tried to explain them by the imbalance of humours, attributing relatively weakened state associated with inactivity, sadness (dysthymos) and anxiety (phobos) by the excessive amount of the 'black bile', thus coining the term 'melancholy' (from Greek 'melas' and 'khole' meaning 'black' and 'bile' respectively). This assumption, although generally incorrect due to the purely theoretical and non-factual concept of the bodily humours, was nevertheless one of the first, if not the first theory linking the psychological conditions to the incorrectly working human body or, as we would put in modern medical parlance, the somatic cause of the psychological conditions. Hippocrates mentions that as temporary sadness is a normal reaction to a loss, melancholy can be differentiated by excessive length or lack of any discernible trigger for the diminished mood, which are basic differences between depression and temporarily abated affect. These observations were also echoed by Aretaeus of Cappadocia who lived in 2nd century CE and pointed out that 'melancholic patients' are not only sad or exhausted, but also stern, serious and torpid although they lack any immediate reason to express any sadness or grief. An interesting case of diagnostics that is professional even for modern standards comes from the works of Galen, who recounts a case of apparent insomnia and from the behaviour of the patients guesses not only that she might suffer not only from melancholy (depression) but also from some other psychological problem she is unwilling to disclose. Consciousness of working with an incomplete set of data and possible error in diagnosis shows a high level of professionalism on account of Galen. I was called in to see a woman who was stated to be sleepless at night and to lie tossing about from one position into another. Finding she had no fever, I made aa detailed inquiry into everything that had happened to her, especially considering such factors as we know to cause insomnia. But she either answered little or nothing at all, as if to show that it was useless to question her. Finally, she turned away, hiding herself completely by throwing the bedclothes over her whole body, and laying her head on another small pillow, as if desiring sleep. After leaving I came to the conclusion that she was suffering from one of two things: either from a melancholy dependent on black bile, or else trouble about something she was unwilling to confess. I therefore deferred till the next day a closer investigation of this. transl. by A.J. Brock. Medieval doctors were generally following and elaborating on the instructions given by Antique authorities, chiefly Aristotle, Hippocrates, Galen and Paul of Aegina, both using the original Greek sources and their versions expanded by the Muslim scholars. In addition to the general understanding of melancholy, a concept of acedia was also commonly discussed in the context of what we would call today a clinical depression. One can argue that the condition described as acedia by the philosophers of late Antiquity and early Middle Ages was to large extent a form of depressive disorder or even an early observation of the manic-depressive (bipolar) disorder. Although commonly translated to English as 'sloth', as in one of the Cardinal Sins, it was generally far more complex condition, that in its various descriptions bears a resemblance to the axial symptoms of depression. For example, Evagrius of Pontus, 4th ccentury Christian philosopher described acedia as a state in which people are unable to start any meaningful task even if they actively try to do so (and starkly differentiates it from slothful disposition), are permanently exhausted and insomniac at the same time, can't focus on any action, and whatever they do, they rarely if ever find any pleasure in it, because 'they do not really know what they want to do' (what is consistent with anhedonia and attention deficit, often associated with clinical depression). Evagrius also notes that this state is usually accompanied with feeling of helplessness, sadness and bouts of crying. Religious notions were also found much later, as e.g. in the works of Johann Christian Heinroth written in 1820s and 1830s, where the author proposed the idea that the melancholy is an affliction of the soul caused by the 'moral conflict' within the patient, what, although the difference in wording is quite distinct, corresponds very well to the modern concept of exogenous depression that is largely caused by the interaction of psychosocial factors and the attitudes of the patients.\",\n",

       " 'Du Huan (fl. c.760), for those who are not familiar with his rather remarkable history, was a Chinese soldier who was born in the Tang capital, Chang\\'an (which stood on the site of modern Xi\\'an), and was captured at the Battle of Talas. This battle, which is notable as the first major encounter between two of the strongest powers in the world at that time, was fought to the east of Transoxiana – what is now in Northern Kyrgyzstan or Southern Kazakhstan – in 751 between outlying forces of the Abbasid Caliphate and the Tang empire. Du Huan and other Chinese prisoners captured in the battle were taken back to the Abbasid capital, Kufa, which was located south of Baghdad in what is now Iraq. Du Huan appears not to have been actually held captive but to have been free to travel fairly widely. Unfortunately, nothing regarding the precise timeline of his years in the west has survived; all we know is that he was able to return to China by sea eleven years later, in 762, using the maritime trade route that was just coming into existence in those years between Siraf, in the Persian Gulf, and Guangzhou (Canton) in southern China. The main reason why we know comparatively little about Du Huan and his voyages is that the Jingxingji, or Travel Record – the book he wrote on his return to China that described them – has been lost. Only a few extracts, totalling about 1,500 characters, have survived; these were incorporated into Scrolls 191 and 193, passages devoted to \\'Border Defence\\' that formed part of the 200-scroll 通典 (Tongdian, or Encyclopaedic History of Institutions), a work compiled c.801 by a relative, Du You (735-812). The Tongdian was submitted to the imperial court, and so entered the Tang state library system to be preserved in its entirely. Sadly, there is no indication that the Travel Record circulated outside Du Huan\\'s family, which probably explains why it has not survived. This is especially unfortunate in that Du Huan led a remarkable life and offers a lot of precise information in the extracts of his work that have survived, much of which, where checkable, appears to be pretty accurate. He genuinely does seem to have travelled widely and reported back in detail on the places he had seen. And, while Schottenhammer cautions that \"it is unlikely that Du Huan visited all of the countries and regions he wrote about personally\" and that \"some information was probably based on hearsay, as he describes various areas only briefly and superficially,\" he tends to preface such passages with the comment \"It is also said...\" This means there is hope we can distinguish between the things that he actually saw in person, and the stories he records that were related to him by other informants – such as one passage that describes a tree on a rock in an ocean, which bears fruit in the form of tiny children about 6 inches 15cm long \"which do not speak but all can laugh and move their hands and feet.\" Now, with all this said, I need next to admit that I\\'ve encountered some other problems in attempting to address your question. Unfortunately, I don\\'t read Chinese, and in the midst of the current pandemic I also have no access to research libraries or to the Tongdian in any form in full, so I\\'m reliant on the works I have here at home in my own library. This is especially unfortunate in that Du Huan\\'s writings appear in variant forms in the secondary works I\\'ve actually consulted for you. What I\\'ll do, then, is set out my findings and the alternative interpretations available as precisely as I can. That way, we will at least take some steps towards a full solution – but that solution, regrettably, is going to need to come from a Chinese speaker with access to the Tongdian. I\\'ll add that the best starting place for someone with the correct linguistic skills appears to be the critical commentary on this work edited by 王文錦 (Wang Wenjin) and published in Beijing by Zhonghua in 1988. Anyway: two particular excerpts concern us; it seems they appear consecutively in the Tongdian. The first describes one of the countries that Du Huan visited, and the second the competing systems of law that you have referenced. However, the three variant translations I have to hand are pretty different, to the point I wouldn\\'t feel confident in following one translation, or ordering, over the others without more opportunity to research. Let\\'s begin with the translation offered by the German ethnographer Wolbert Smidt. His work on the subject is the most focused, the most scholarly and the most precise available to me, and so, while we have to note that he uses it to prove some specific assertions about the places that Da Huan actually visited, I think we need to privilege it, which is why I begin with it here: We also went to Molin, Southwest of Yangsaluo. One reaches this country after having crossed the great desert and having travelled 2,000 Li. The people there are black, their customs rough. There is little rice and cereals and there is no grass and trees. The horses are fed with dried fish, the people eat XX word not identified and also Persian dates. Subtropical diseases Malaria are widespread. After crossing the inland there is a mountainous country, there are a lot of confessions. The followers of the confession of the \"Dashi\" the Arabs – thus, Islam have a means to denote the degrees of family relations, but it is degenerated and they don\\'t bother about it. They don\\'t eat the meat of pigs, dogs, donkeys and horses, they don\\'t respect neither the king of the country, neither their parents, they don\\'t believe in supernatural powers, they perform sacrifice to heaven and to no one else. According their customs every seventh day is a holiday, on which no trade and no cash transactions are done, whereas when they drink alcohol, they are behaving in a ridiculous and undisciplined way during the whole day. Within a missing term here in Smidt seems to be Daqin, the Chinese word that can mean either \"Rome\" or \"Syria\" – though Du Huan also uses \"Fulin\" to mean Byzantine Empire and \"Shan\" to mean \"Syria\" – but he simply has \"East Roman confession\". At any rate, what is actually meant here is \"Christianity\" the medical doctors know diarrhoea – or they recognise it already before the outbreak of the disease, or they open the brain and insects come out. Next we have the translation of Li Anshan, in his A History of Overseas Chinese in Africa. This suggests that the passage you are interested in follows directly on from the section on the Molin state, or kingdom, or country (the same Chinese word, \\'guo\\', can be translated to mean any of these terms): We then visited the Mo-lin Kingdom. It was to the southwest of the Jiu Sa Luo Kingdom. We crossed a large river, walked two thousand miles and reached the kingdom. People there were black, rude, and uncivilized. There were few grains, no grass or trees. Horses ate dry fish. People ate Niao Mang, which is Asian Dates. There were a lot of plagues. The kingdom was on a land route to many other kingdoms. There was one country, governed by several laws: Dashi Law, Daqing Law, and Xunxun Law. Xunxun Law was the harshest law among all foreign laws. Talking was forbidden during meals. Under Dashi Law, people punished their own family and children, even for minor faults. This was so that they themselves would not be blamed for others\\' crimes. People there did not eat pig, dog, donkey, or horse meat. They did not revere or worship their kings or parents. They believed in deities and ghosts. Its custom was to set aside one holiday for every seven days. On holidays, sales and banking were banned; people drank alcohol and played all day. Note, here, that neither Smidt nor Li Anshan state explicitly that the \"one country \\'governed by several laws\\'\" that you are interested in is necessarily Molin, and in fact Smidt\\'s translation implies that the two are distinct places, separated by mountains. This problem becomes significant when we move on to the third translation available to me, by Wan Lei. This version separates the two passages and inserts a sub-heading at this point, which appears to be the translator\\'s own interpretation of what follows. As such it definitely seems to suggest we cannot assume the passage on laws necessarily refers to Molin – but while Smidt seems to suggest the land of three laws is a distinct place, Wan Lei instead implies the three laws are common to many of the places he visited. We\\'d need to consult the Tongjian in the original to be certain which of these approaches is the more nearly accurate.',\n",
       " \"(1/2) I can't comment on the specifics of American elections and how different wins have been interpreted but at a more abstract level, things are actually the other way around: the United States is notable historically for the fact that presidential candidates tend to, on average, win by bigger margins than in many western democratic nations. This table starts with the 2000 Presidential election in the US, and then counts back up to 10 elections (Presidential for the US and France; parliamentary for all others), which in most cases takes a country back to about the 1960s, tracking the difference in vote share between the party/candidate that came first and the party/candidate that came second (a minus indicates the party that came first was beaten in a majoritarian system by the party that came second, like Trump beat Clinton in '16): |No.|USA|UK|Canada|France|Germany|Australia|New Zealand|Jamaica| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1|-0.5|12.5|19.1|5.2|5.8|-2|8.2|17.3| |2|8.5|7.5|22.6|8|5|5|5.7|20| |3|5.6|11.4|11.1|3.6|10.3|10.3|0.4|13.3| |4|7.8|14.8|22.0|1.6|7.2|7.2|12.6|17.8| |5|18.2|7|11.8|16.4|10.6|10.6|4|13.5| |6|8.7|3.4|-4.2|10.4|1.6|1.6|7|13| |7|2.1|-0.7|7.7||6|6|-0.2|1.6| |8|23.2|3.3|3.4||0.9|0.9|-0.6|1.4| |9|0.7|6.1|13.9||3.4|3.4|8|10.5| |10|22.6|0.7|7.8||8.3|8.3|6.9|11.5| |Avg.|9.7|6.6|11.5|7.5|5.9|5.9|4.6|12.2| So actually, the United States isn't all that remarkable in the history of western democracy - of these eight comparative countries, only Canada and Jamaica have a higher than average victory margin in major national elections, and Canada's would be lower if not for the fact the 1993 and 1997 elections were fought in the context of a collapse in one of the two major political parties that had been operating up until that point, fragmenting the opposition vote. Australia is the most useful comparison perhaps because the Australian authorities undertake what is called a Two Party Preferred count, where regardless of the result in each part of the country, each ballot (where voters have to rank all candidates in order of preference) is recounted to determine whether voters on the whole preferred the Labor Party or Liberal/National Coalition to win the election. On average, voters only favour one party by a margin of just shy of 53% - 47%. Likewise in France, where voters pick between the top two candidates in a run-off, the average margin of victory has varied wildly and averages out at under 10 points. It is the effect of different voting systems that exaggerates or diminishes the public, political and media perception of how strong a win is. In a country like Germany, whilst a ten point lead is a strong result and an historic over-performance, the proportional system means it does not guarantee getting into government with a strong majority, as a leading party has only won more than half the seats in the Bundestag once since WWII, and so a party's ability to govern decisively is also determined by the balance of votes for other parties. But in a majoritarian system where votes are translated into seats in a way that tends to exaggerate the win of the victorious party or candidate, our sense of what constitutes a landslide can become warped. In the case of the United States, the Electoral College means that in most elections a substantial share of the popular vote will be converted into a much bigger share of electoral votes, because a candidate who wins a state (with a couple of exceptions) will carry all of its electoral votes, and there is no requirement for the allocation of electoral votes to match the overall national vote - there are really ~50 separate elections happening for President, not one single election. For example in 1988, George H W Bush beat Michael Dukakis by a margin of 7.8pts, 53.4% to 45.6%. This translated into an electoral vote margin of 426 - 112, or a 79.2% - 20.8% victory. Bush's practical margin for determining who wins power was 58.4pts. The Electoral College exaggerated the scale of Bush's win compared to the popular vote by a factor almost 8 times. But the same system could have just as easily cost Bush the Presidency if voters behaved slightly differently in 12 key states.\",\n",
       " 'Among the 134 workers who suffered acute radiation sickness (ARS) after being exposed to very high doses of radiation, 28 died due to ARS. 19 others died by 2004 of other causes. For the wider population of 72,000 emergency workers with estimated doses, an estimated 216 had died of effects of radiation by 1998 (Bennett, 2006). This is the source of the low number of approximately 200. The actual number of deaths due to radiation from the accident is impossible to measure accurately. It isn\\'t possible to attribute the cause of any individual cancer case to as accident or non-accident. Given measurements of an exposed population compared to an equivalent control non-exposed population, the accident-caused deaths can be estimated; this is the method used to estimate the 216 deaths above. However, for most of the affected people, the expected increase in cancer rates is quite low compared to the normal cancer rates, and it is very difficult to accurate estimate the increase. This is made worse by changes in health care, alcohol consumption, and smoking rates, which have been affected by economic and other changes over time which included very dramatic changes such as the fall of the Soviet Union and economic collapse. Estimates of the expected future accident-caused deaths were about 4,000 for the most-affected 600,000 people (evacuees, emergency workers, etc.), and about 5,000 among the 6,000,000 people living in the other contaminated areas. In addition, there would be some accident-caused deaths in the rest of minimally-exposed Europe. The projection of 4,000 additional deaths for the most-affected 600,000 people is in line with the estimate of 216 deaths among 72,000 emergency workers by 1998. There are high estimates of the number of deaths, including a very high estimate of 300,000 and also a high estimate of 200,000 by Greenpeace. These appear to be gross overestimates - extrapolating the death rate among the 72,000 emergency workers to the wider population of 6 million people in contaminated areas, and then tripling it, only brings the total to about 50,000 deaths, and the wider population with lower exposure than the 72,000 emergency workers should have a lower rate of additional deaths. Brown\\'s book is not science, and it isn\\'t (good) history either. It presents many anecdotes, and is very selective with the science that is presented as \"correct\". One of the scientists interviewed for the book, Jim Smith, reviewed the book, and discussed the science and mis-science in detail (Smith, ). Smith had other complaints about the book. For example, Brown dismissed his work on wildlife populations in the area by presenting him as a scientist who didn\\'t feel it necessary to go to the Chernobyl area to draw his pre-formed conclusions about the effect of the accident, ignoring (a) the first three authors from Belarus with plenty of local experience, and (b) Smith\\'s approximately 40 visits to the Chernobyl area. From Brown\\'s book, the reader easily gets the impression that Smith\\'s work can and should be ignored, e.g., as noted in this review of Brown\\'s book: https://forbetterscience.com/2019/10/23/kate-browns-manual-for-survival-a-chernobyl-book-review/ Smith also points out some good points about the book, things that Brown quite rightly and justifiably criticises. The conclusion to Smith\\'s review summarised both good and bad about Brown\\'s book: Kate Brown has a journalist\\'s skill in capturing the individual tragedies of many people\\'s lives in the Chernobyl contaminated lands and she puts this to good use in describing her many visits to these areas. The problem is real, but I think the diagnosis offered in Manual for Survival is very wrong and damaging.

       " \"More can always be said, but there's some recent scholarship putting it all in a bit of doubt. This paper mentions in passing that there is archaeological evidence that small pieces of cloth were used for anal hygiene. This short piece in German mentions that recent scholarship thinks the sponge on a stick was really used for anal cleaning, or whether it was more akin to a toilet brush. Finally, this paper by Wiplinger which is only available in German puts forth a theory that it really was more hygienic than the common theory of a sponge on a stick suggests. Since the paper is in German, I'll paraphrase the most important points: - There is some archaeological evidence for small jugs that would be used much like a mobile low-tech bidet - one puts the jug below yourself and uses the left hand to clean, a method that is still in use in some Middle Eastern countries - The evidence for the use of the sponge on a stick for anal hygiene was always rather weak - apparently there's only five sources and they are much less than clear. None of them point to the alleged usage, only three say the sponge on a stick was used in latrines - The usage of a xylospongium is not only unhygienic, it also appears to be rather unpractical and even dangerous - Now, the author proposes two other usages: Maybe it was used like a toilet brush, and the author suggests the common usage of such devices in many cultures nowadays indicates this may be the case. or maybe it was used to soak up excess water on the seats. - The author also gives some evidence that many latrines were likely clean and well-maintained rooms, such as the availability of water to clean, and the usage of marble in upper-class latrines. in sum, it would appear to me that there's little evidence for the usage of a shared sponge of a stick, and som evidence for alternative means of anal hygiene. Also, as said, many of the latrines appear to have been of high standard, as the author linked above points out, whereas others may have not been as clean or beautiful - but this isn't different from today, the free public toilet in parks, for example, tend to be much less often cleaned than private toilets even today. I'd also like to point out - heck, so does the author of the last link - that wikipedia somehow has an article saying the sponge on a stick method was definitely, certianly used, but the source is... questionable. Sure, there's a Seneca letter where he writes about a gladiator committing suicide by ramming a sponge on a stick down his throat in a latrine, but crucially, Seneca writes this device was used to remove the obscene. What this word means is questionable. Some translate it as the butt, or anal region, whereas others translate it as stain, a smear. Wiplinger points out that the word obscene isn't usually taken to mean the butt, but a bunch of unclean things. This does make it questionable that it was indeed used to clean, well, the butt. Finally, I would like to point out that all of this is informed speculation, not certain knowledge. We don't have direct sources of a Roman author describing in-depth how latrines worked, and we don't have direct sources of how latrines were cleaned. However, I think Wiplinger's theory makes a lot more sense than the commonly repeated one about a sponge on a stick.\",\n",
       " \"This is a really fascinating question. Firstly, you are certainly correct that horses were introduced with the arrival of Europeans to the Americas. Before the arrival of the horse, Plains Indians lived in semi-sedentary villages, hunted buffalo, gathered plants, and grew crops such as maize, squash and beans, especially in the Southern sections of the great plains. While the introduction of the horse certainly did make it easier to hunt buffalo, and made a purely nomadic lifestyle viable, it was done without the horse as well. The Olson-Chubbuck Bison Kill Site and Jones-Miller Bison Kill Site date back as many as 10,000 years and between show evidence of the hunting and butchering of 500 buffalo in a methodical, organized way. The typical method for killing bison without the horse was herding the buffalo into an enclosed corral, known as a buffalo pound, or herding them off of a cliff, known as a buffalo jump. Buffalo are nearsighted, so it's possible to get close to them funnel them into a pound or a jump by running them between low stone walls, using fire, or by encircling them in small groups. In this way, buffalo were a source of meat for Plains Indians, as well as a source of tools, clothes and shelter. Once the horse become widespread, buffalo hunting became viable as the sole method of feeding, clothing and sheltering oneself and one's family. In this way, the horse culture with which we are more familiar with today rose to prominence. Although the horse was first brought to the Americas by Hernan Cortes, the start of the horse's dominance on the Great Plains was in 1680, when the Pueblo expelled the Spanish from New Mexico, and captured a large number of horses the Spanish left behind. By the 1730s, the Comanche were fully nomadic, and had become the great power of the southern plains, and by the 1770s, the horse was widespread across the northern plains, and buffalo hunting became an absolutely critical part of the way many tribes fed themselves. To pose a direct answer to your last question--the evidence that we have as to what these cultures were like before they had access to horses is twofold--firstly, archaeological, and secondly written descriptions from Europeans who encountered them before the widespread horse culture, in the time between European contact and the 1730s. The conquistador Francisco Vázquez de Coronado y Luján is the first European whose record we have of contact with the Plains Indian tribes, around 1540. Henry Kelsey, an Englishman, witnessed an Assiniboine hunt in Canada in the 1690s, before the horse had arrived that far North. We do not have written records, however, from Plains Indians of that era describing how they hunted buffalo. In terms of archaeological evidence, there are numerous kill sites and buffalo jumps that we know of, ranging widely in the dates used, but going back as long as 10,000 years ago.\",\n",

       " 'Many cultures linked meteorites, and meteoric iron, with the sky. Even today, meteors are often called \"falling stars\", and the association between meteors (the bright traces visible in the sky) and meteorites (the bits that survive the journey and reach the ground) has often been observed. For example, one shower of meteorites was described in Australian oral history (Hamacher & Norris, 2009): The sky moved, heaved and billowed. The stars tumbled and clattered and fell against one another. The Milky Way split and great star groups were scattered. Many stars fell to the earth, flashing in the sky. A large red glowing mass burst in the air, giving a deafening roar, as it scattered millions of molten pieces on the ground. This occurred all night. The ground was covered in burned holes and great mounds, formed from the falling pieces. If a meteorite fall was witnessed from not too far away, the actual fall can sometimes be seen. A witness described a meteorite fall in NSW, Australia, 1999, which damaged a house (Flood et al., 2002): like a huge flamy ball crossing in a direction from the middle northern sky. After a few seconds it broke into one large fragment and two middle-sized bits with a lot of rubble fragments flying off. If the fall of the rock itself is not visible, light and noise can be seen and heard, leading to a common association of meteorites with lighting. Meteorites themselves were sometimes believed to be the physical remains of lightning bolts, and were called \"thunderbolts\" (Wainwright, 1932). Sometimes, meteoric iron was believed to be produced when rocks were struck by lightning. Today, people know about other things that fall from the sky and made loud noises and craters: bombs. Some meteorites falls, either from seeing a falling object and then hearing the explosive impact, or just hearing the impact, are mis-identified as bombs dropped from aircraft: https://www.meteorite-recon.com/home/meteorite-documentaries/sulagiri-meteorite-fall/p3 The earliest Egyptian word we know for iron was replaced in about 1300BC with \"iron-from-the-sky\" (Johnson et al., 2013), so it is quite clear that by this time, it was known that meteorites and meteoric iron came from the sky. The Hittites were also aware of meteoric iron coming from the sky (Bjorkman, 1973).Of course, this isn\\'t the same as being \"aware this iron came from outer space\" with our modern understanding of outer space. Any other examples of similar artifacts ? There are many known artefacts made from meteoric iron. Most, if not all, surviving Bronze Age iron objects are meteoric iron. The tomb of Tutankhamun contained contained other iron objects. An iron amulet and a miniature model iron head-rest (i.e., a pillow) were found in his coffin, and 16 miniature blades elsewhere in the tomb (Johnson et al., 2013). 5,000 year old Egyptian iron beads have been found. Two ancient Chinese axe heads with bronze bodies and meteoric iron blades have been found. Bjorkman lists some of the ancient meteoric iron objects, such as a macehead(?), an axehead, amulets, plaques, and small fragments. Any theories on why they even chose this metal to smelt ? A key attraction was the sky-origin. The known meteoric iron objects are mostly, if not all, from the Bronze Age and later, when bronze provided a cheaper and more readily available, more easily worked, and more corrosion resistant metal, just as hard and tough as iron. Meteoric iron was used specifically because it was meteoric. Meteoric iron continued to be used on occasion well into the Iron Age for the same reason. In principle, meteoric iron might have seen some use before the Bronze Age purely for practical purposes. For example, telluric iron (i.e., naturally occurring metallic iron of non-meteoric origin) was used in Greenland into recent times for making small blades and projectile points because it was the only metal available. As a final note on terminology, \"smelting\" is the process of converting non-metallic ore into metal. This isn\\'t necessary for meteoric iron, since it\\'s metallic iron rather than iron ore. The oldest-known meteoric iron objects are usually cold-forged (the 5,000 year old Egyptian beads and the Bronze Age Chinese axe blades were cold-forged). Later objects can be cold-forged or hot-forged, and are sometimes forge-welded (e.g., Tutankhamun\\'s dagger and head-rest). Much more recent objects sometimes combine a small amount of meteoric iron with smelted iron, such as the small fraction of Indonesian keris blades which include meteoric iron, e.g., from the Prambanan meteorite. The Prambanan meteorite is a good example of the reverence and awe that meteorites can inspire.

It's definitely not limited to American history. I routinely use it to study the ancient Mediterranean. The good thing is that the basics of using most research databases will be the same as Jstor in terms of how to enter search parameters. EbscoHost is another popular option depending on what version your school has. My high school had access to a large database of papers though Ebsco, but the only relevant feature my current university has is historical bibliography which gives you titles and publishing info, but not the whole text. Beyond those two, it can vary massively between universities depending on their subscriptions. Many academic publishers have databases that universities can subscribe too, I've personally had a lot of luck with University of Chicago Press and Cambridge Press, but it will vary from subject to subject. Most universities have pretty similar infrastructure for this. Go to your library web page and their should be an option that brings up all of the different research subscriptions you have access too. The library search bar at a lot of universities will also search many of those databases and put papers matching your search in the results in addition to books actually in the library collections. Google scholar is more of a toss up. I generally find that it's just long lists of times when something I want was cited elsewhere, which is useful for finding titles to search for on another service. A really invaluable resource is Academia.edu and ResearchGate.com, which are websites where academics can upload their work and make it freely available.

       " 'Hi! As this question pertains to basic, underlying facts of the Holocaust, I hope you can appreciate that it can be a fraught subject to deal with. While we want people to get the answers they are looking for, we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of response. As such, this message is not intended to provide you with all of the answers, but simply to address some of the basic facts, as well as Holocaust Denial, and provide a short list of introductory reading. There is always more than can be said, but we hope this is a good starting point for you. ##What Was the Holocaust? The Holocaust refers the genocidal deaths of 5-6 million European Jews carried out systematically by Nazi Germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during World War II. Some historians will also include the deaths of the Roma, Communists, Mentally Disabled, and other groups targeted by Nazi policies, which brings the total number of deaths to 11-17 million. Debates about whether or not the Holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions, but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred. ##But This Guy Says Otherwise! Unfortunately, there is a small, but at times vocal, minority of persons who fall into the category of Holocaust Denial, attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude, impugn well proven facts, or even claim that the Holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened. Although they often self-style themselves as \"Revisionists\", they are not correctly described by the title. While revisionism is not inherently a dirty word, actual revision, to quote Michael Shermer, \"entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.\" It is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in 1950 or so, you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject, and that is the result of good revisionism. But these changes, which even can be quite large, such as the reassessment of deaths at Auschwitz from ~4 million to ~1 million, are done within the bounds of respected, academic study, and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars, and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections. There are still plenty of questions within Holocaust Studies that are debated by scholars, and there may still be more out there for us to discover, and revise, but when it comes to the basic facts, there is simply no valid argument against them. ##So What Are the Basics? Beginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership. First only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler’s approval. The early killings were carried out foremost by the Einsatzgruppen, paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the SS and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of Jews, Communists, and other \\'undesirable elements\\' in the wake of the German military\\'s advance. In what is often termed the \\'Holocaust by Bullet\\', the Einsatzgruppen, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too. By early 1942, the \"Final Solution\" to the so-called \"Jewish Question\" was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval. Construction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of \\'Operation Reinhard\\', had began operation by spring of 1942. Roughly 2 million persons, nearly all Jewish men, women, and children, were immediately gassed upon arrival at Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka over the next two years, when these \"Reinhard\" camps were closed and razed. More victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as Chełmno, but most infamously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where slightly over 1 million persons, mostly Jews, died. Under the plan set forth at Wannsee, exterminations were hardly limited to the Jews of Poland, but rather Jews from all over Europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter. Although the victims of the Reinhard Camps were originally buried, they would later be exhumed and cremated, and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as Auschwitz. ##The Camps There were two main types of camps run by Nazi Germany, which is sometimes a source of confusion. Concentration Camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the Nazis shortly after taking power, beginning with the construction of Dachau in 1933. Political opponents of all type, not just Jews, could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the pre-war years, and while conditions were often brutal and squalid, and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment, they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly. Although Concentration Camps were later made part of the \\'Final Solution\\', their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers. Some were \\'way stations\\', and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as \"extermination through labor\". Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and \"allowed\" to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end. Although some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps. The Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Bełżec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war. Several camps, however, were \\'Hybrids\\' of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was a vast complex of subcamps. The infamous \\'selection\\' of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies. ##How Do We Know? Running through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony. We have testimonies and writings from many who participated, as well German documentation of the programs. This site catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass extermination as it relates to Auschwitz. I\\'ll end this with a short list of excellent works that should help to introduce you to various aspects of Holocaust study. ##Further Reading \"Third Reich Trilogy by Richard Evans \"Hitler, the Germans, and the Final Solution by Ian Kershaw \"Auschwitz: A New History by Laurence Rees \"Ordinary Men by Christopher Browning \"Denying the Holocaust by Deborah E.

       " \"More taken than given. During the seven years war France and Britain found themselves on opposite sides, along with the Prussians allied with Britain and Austrians allied with France. French Canada which at the time included some other territory beyond modern Quebec in places like Prince Edward Island and parts of New Brunswick today. During the conflict the Royal Navy gained the advantage at see allowing Britain to cut French forces in the region off from supplies and reinforcements from France while Britain was free to deploy its own troops into the region. For the first few years of the conflict the French still did well thanks in large part with their alliances with a number of powerful first nation polities. However this success was mostly confined to warding off the initial British attempts to invade French Canada, raids and attacking frontier forts. But by 1758 though Britain was bringing in more troops and negotiated a treaty with many of the most powerful first nation groups. Mostly this involved some that where previously neutral throwing their lot in with Britain in return for guarantees and some of the French's allies moved to be neutral. This native allies where extremely important in this kind of terrain where their intelligence and ability to augment the light infantry and scouting abilities of the European armies could be very useful. British forces in the region then spent the next two years taking the network of forts the composed the main block of the French defences in the region which was relatively sparsely populated with its main purpose being connected to the fur trade and the like. Eventually they worked their way into the core of the French territory by 1759 and French forces in the region's largest settlements where beaten outside of Quebec city and and the city capitulated shortly after this defeat. While in the spring of the next year French forces attempted to retake the city when this attempt was ground to a halt French forces had more or less run out of options and British forces renewed their attack into Montreal taking the French forts there and forcing treaties onto France's first nation allies. At the end of the conflict France was forced to officially recognise the surrender of its conflicts over to Britain.\",\n",
       " \"You may also find more answers your questions in this thread by u/enygma9753. The war in North America was over by 1760 with the capitulation of the remaining French forces at Montreal, but the Seven Years War still raged on elsewhere in the world. France had hoped to capture British possessions overseas to improve its hand at the peace negotiations, but its European military commitments and its loss to the British navy at Quiberon Bay in 1759 meant they would have difficulty in reinforcing their overseas colonies. Britain had captured virtually all of France's sugar colonies in the Caribbean by 1763, which were more profitable than the colony in Canada with its less profitable fur trade. During the peace negotiations, France had the option of surrendering Guadaloupe and its valuable sugar trade and retaining Quebec, or getting Guadaloupe back and giving up Quebec to Britain. France chose Guadaloupe sugar over Canadian furs, while Britain suddenly became new masters of some 70-80,000 French Catholic subjects -- who resented Britain's conquest of New France, but also felt abandoned (and even betrayed) by France's willingness to cede New France and leave them to an uncertain fate. How Britain dealt with Quebec and its generous accommodation of French Canadians and their native allies would help set the stage for rebellion in the Thirteen Colonies within 15 years.\",\n",
       " 'For Sweden, about half the Swedish merchant fleet of some 1,8 million tons were caught outside the North Sea blockade enforced by the British and the Germans after the German invasion of Norway in April 1940. The other half was in the Baltic Sea, the Danish Belts and the area east of Dogger\\'s Banks. 13 Swedish merchant ships were sunk from April to June in the fighting, and by the end of it, Sweden had been cut off from foreign trade except at the mercy of both Britain and especially Germany. Sweden did do limited trade with other neutral nations throught \"lejdtrafiken\", an agreement with both the British and Germans to pass a small number of ships through the dual blockade - the first ship, the tanker M/S Sveadrott carrying 13 700 tons of oil from Venezuela arrived on the 8th of September, 1940. \"Lejdtrafiken\" proved vital to supplying Sweden, and 5 ships per month were allowed through 1940 and 1941, which was increased to 70 ships per eear in 1942 and 80 ships per year in 1943. As these ships brought in vital strategic resources, chiefly oil (usually from Mexico or Venzuela), rubber (mostly from Brazil), grain (mostly from Brazil), meat (mostly from Argentina) and colonial goods such as tobacco, cocoa, dried or canned fruit, coffee and tea. The latter were usually the cause of small celebrations when the arrival of a ship was announced in the papers, as the schedule and route of the ships were kept a strict secret according with the agreements with the British and Germans. As you can probably guess, with the fixed number of ships allowed to pass, Sweden used the largest, fastest and most modern ships for this trade to get as much goods as ever possible - despite this, \"lejdtrafiken\" never managed to bring in more than about 15% of Sweden\\'s pre-war imports. In October 1944, the trade was closed due to Sweden stop on export on iron ore to Germany and Norwegian ships in Sweden breaking out into the North Sea to sail to Britain with a load of precious ball bearins. It was resumed in early Spring 1945. 10 ships were sunk and 166 Swedish sailors died during this trade during the war - 5 by mines, 4 by German subarines (usually while sailing past Britain) and 1 by German planes. The ships caught outside the German and British blockade usually sailed for the Allies - partially becuase those were shippping that paid well, partially because there were little other things to ship. The dollars and pounds recieved in payment was used to pay for the imports that were brought in through \"lejdtrafiken\". The American State Department also chartered the passanger liners M/S Gripsholm and S/S Drottningholm - I /u/vonadler have written about this a bit here - to exchange civilians and diplomatic staff between the warring countries. Of these ships, 270 were sunk during the war, and roughly 2 000 Swedish sailors died. The ships in the Baltic Sea maintained regular peace-time trade in the Baltic Sea - they mainly shipped iron ore (alhough wood, paper pulp, copper and ball bearings were also shipped) from Luleå (in Summer) and Oxelösund (in winter) to Rotterdam, Hamburg, Emden, Bremen and Danzig/Gdansk and returned with coal, coke, artificial fertilizer, oil cakes (animal fodder) and artificial fuel and rubber. 12 ships were lost -2 fishing vessels sunk by German minesweepers, 1 of a Soviet mine outside Memel, 1 by a British mine, 8 by Soviet submarines. 187 sailors and passengers died, and 6 sailors picked up as prisoners by a Soviet submarine are executed at Kronstadt. So, what you do depends first on wether or not you were caught outside the German and Britihs blockade of the North Sea. If outside, you would most likely sail the dangerous trade for the British and later the Allies through the Atlantic, delivering vital war supplies to Britain and braving German submarine attacks, mines and air attacks, gaining vital foreign currency for Swedish imports through \"lejdtrafiken\". If your ship was modern, large and fast, it could be selected to be one of the ships going through \"lejdtrafiken\" bringing in vital supplies for the survival of the Swedish people and the Swedish armed forces (and in case of coloinial goods, morale). If your ship was in the Baltic Sea or along the Swedish west coast when the blockad was erected, you would sail iron ore and coal trade between Sweden, German-controlled Poland and Germany or bring in some other goods. This trade as a bit less dangerous, but Soviet submarines in 1942 and 1944 still took its toll, especially the sinking of the passenger liner S/S Hansa, which was sailing its regular route between Nynäshamn just south of Stockholm and Visby on Gotland on the 24th of November 1944, when 84 people died. The chief incentive to sail for the Allies across the continent were the payments in pounds and dollars, which could be used to purchase vital food and raw materials in neutral countries to ship back to Sweden through \"lejdtrafiken\".',\n",
       " 'There was some small-scale use of Spanish arms and horses by indigenous peoples during the 17th century. However, trade in horses and arms with them was prohibited by the Spanish, so only a small trickle of armour, swords, and firearms made their way into indigenous hands, by illegal trade, theft, or as war booty during most of the 17th century. Peoples under Spanish rule, with their ownership of horses prohibited, could not engage in horse breeding on any significant scale. The first significant military use of Spanish arms and horses by native forces appears to be the use of horses by Spanish allies in the Mixton Wars of 1540-1542. Spanish manpower shortages resulted in the Spanish allowing the native allies to use horses in the war. The much longer Chichimeca War which followed (1550-1590) saw the use of horses against the Spanish. The Chichimeca captured horses when they could, and used them to provide mobility for their raiders. If they encountered Spanish horses, but couldn\\'t steal them for their own use, they would attempt to kill them to deprive the Spanish of them. They used Spanish weapons which they captured, and are known to have used small numbers of swords in the war. They are known to have captured Spanish guns, and are likely to have made what use their limited supply of ammunition allowed. Horse ownership in native hands exploded in 1680, when the Pueblo Indians revolted against Spanish rule, with spectacular success, acquiring thousands of horses and the freedom to breed horses free of Spanish interferences. Many of these horses were traded to their neighbours, such as the Ute, Apache, and Comanches, who then proceeded to breed their own. The Comanche established their own substantial empire based on their military use of the horse. The Spanish return 12 years later was facilitated by Pueblo willingness to work with the Spanish against the threat of raiding by their now-mounted neighbours. The Spanish, with only small numbers, realised that it was mutual - they needed Pueblo assistance against raids themselves. They lifted the previous bans on native ownership of horses and guns. Unlike horses, guns, swords, and armour needed to be made rather than bred, and supply was limited until large-scale gun trading came. This meant that while guns, swords, and armour saw limited native use in the 17th century, it could only be quite limited use. The arrival of the horse in large numbers before guns resulted in the Comanche using armoured cavalry - armoured soldiers on armoured horses, with the lance as their main weapon. Their armour was rawhide, well able to resist arrows. The heyday of Comanche armoured cavalry was the first half of the 19th century; as guns became more common, the value of such heavy armour fell. The Comanche appear to have captured some Spanish armour, with one of their well-known warriors and leader nicknamed \"Iron Jacket\" for his use of Spanish armour (he was born c. 1790 and killed in battle in 1858). He had inherited his armour from his father (or uncle) who was known to the Mexicans as \"Coat of Mail\". Southern Mesoamerica was less suited for large-scale use of horses, and it is no surprise to see less use of them in the protracted conquest of the Yucatan. Spanish arms and armour would have been used in small numbers, again limited by the lack of native manufacture. Further south, some peoples, notably the Mapuche people south of the Inca Empire, used guns in their resistance to the Spanish. For some discussion of this, see the reply by u/CommodoreCoCo in: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3j5rfi/why_did_north_american_precolumbian_cultures/ References For the use of horses by the Chichimeca and others, see Forbes, J. , \"The Appearance of the Mounted Indian in Northern Mexico and the Southwest, to 1680\", Southwestern Journal of Anthropology 15, 189-212. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3628807 Powell, P.

       " 'This was written in 1875 by Henry Hudson Holly^1 Our materials, climates, and habits differ enough from those of Europe to demand a distinctive change in their use and arrangement. For example, in European countries, wood, a most valuable building material, is rare and expensive, while in most sections of our own it is very abundant. But instead of using this in accordance with its nature and capacities, we have stupidly employed it in copying, as exactly as we can, details of foreign architecture which were designed with reference to the constructive capacities of brick and stone. Hence we see rounded arches, keystones, and buttresses of wood… Fortunately our people are beginning to recognize the folly of such unmeaning shams, and when stone or brick is adopted, it is treated as such; and when wood is employed, we are properly commencing to show details adapted to its nature. Until, however, we come to possess a vernacular style, we must content ourselves to copying; and the question arises, which of the innumerable systems is best suited to our requirements? Architecture and construction practices are regional and cultural. What works gets repeated and over time it becomes so common that people forget why things are done a certain way. This is known as vernacular architecture. The history of construction materiality goes something like this: the only structural materials available were stone, brick, and wood. The gaps in the structure were then infilled in with sticks, mud mixed with horse hair, animal dung, plaster, or more wood and brick if you could afford it. Houses were heated and meals were cooked with open flames and because of this they often burned down. Due to that last fact, people preferred stone and brick homes if they could afford them. That’s architecture for 98% of human history (time since the invention of stick framing divided by time since the neolithic revolution) and largely the period in which Europeans developed their construction technologies and prejudices. The US developed in a climate where there were endless virgin forests that weren\\'t exhausted until after WWI. There was a lot of construction technology innovation as well. Balloon framing (or at least it was popularized here), platform framing, skyscrapers, steel, the twists (now deformations) in steel reinforced concrete, slurry walls, fast tracked construction, etc. were all invented here. The materials available to us, what works for our more diverse climate, and subsequently what became our regional vernacular, are different. For a similar but different timeline check out Japan\\'s construction and home preferences I understand that timber frames are cost effective as opposed to something like limestone, but brick is actually in a comparable price range. This is likely semantics, but it’s a good jumping off point - timber frames are far more expensive than what we typically build, and hence are rarely used as a structural system today. They’re what you think of when you think of old Medieval towns or Amish barn construction. It employs large timbers; 6x6, 8x10, etc. (inches in cross section). It can be beautiful, but it requires skilled labor, many people, complicated connections, and large trees; all of which are anathema to producing a home inexpensively today. It’s also a less efficient use of timber. There are countries (Japan) and technologies (Dietrich software, CLT, glulams, etc.) that are changing this, but that\\'s a different topic. The successor to timber framed construction, balloon framing using 2x4s, was invented/popularized in Chicago in the early 19th century. Walls several stories tall consisted of long 2x4s that were assembled on the ground and tilted up. Ledger boards would be attached to the balloon framing and floors would be built off of them. Buildings could be built much more quickly using this method because individual workers could handle the pieces of wood and connections could be made with nails. The issue with this method of construction is that it requires long mature trees. That and the attachment of the ledger board to the balloon framing left a gap in the stud cavity which fire could and often did spread to upper floors through. For this reason it\\'s rarely used or allowed today. The successor to balloon framing is platform framing. The walls of each floor are built individually, tilted up, and the floors are built on top of them. This requires shorter pieces of lumber and the floor stops fire from spreading. This is what\\'s used today. Why? Because it’s ridiculously inexpensive, and performs well. 2x4 stud walls are like aluminum cans In a certain way, they’re right at the edge of being junk, but there’s also pure genius behind their design and function. You’re correct that brick, as a material, is quite cheap (~50 cents each), but it requires far more and higher skill labor which ultimately makes it very expensive in the US. We also use less of it which further increases the price. The US and our largest trading partner, Canada, have lots of trees so lumber is (until Covid hit) cheap. That and the US contains quite a few very cold and seismic regions both of which do not lend themselves to masonry construction. The combination of all the above: technologies invented here, cheap lumber, lack of existing housing supply, rapid population growth, varied climates, a shift away from heating with open flames, etc. meant that the conditions in which America developed its construction preferences was different than that of Europe\\'s. The fact that we\\'re still building out of 2x4s is some combination of industry inertia mixed with the genius that is the 2x4 wall. SIPs (structurally insulated panels), ICFs (insulated concrete forms), or advanced framing with 2x6s are all \"better\" alternatives technologically. Even modern homes in the UK built in the 2000s have real brick walls, and quality floorboards. Are current homes in the UK really built with solid brick walls? I like masonry. It has a lot of favorable attributes (inexpensive material, fireproof, high thermal mass, doesn’t rot, absorbs acoustic energy, literally bullet proof), but it also has some serious drawbacks (poor thermal insulator, requires skilled labor, performs poorly in earthquakes, can’t use it in tension). In the US, when you see a brick home that isn’t a hundred years old it’s actually a veneer system called a cavity wall. That is, it’s a 2x4 structure that holds up a single wythe (one brick thick) brick veneer. If constructed properly it’s an excellent way to build. Almost no one constructs it properly, but it suffers fools well. “Quality floorboards” is a loaded topic. Do you mean wide solid hardwood boards? Because wood expands and contracts in three directions but primarily radially which is why floorboards tend to cup. The wider they are the more they cup. Beautiful, yes. Flat, no. To help with this you cut them short around the perimeter so they can expand and contract. Then you place trim around the perimeter to hide this gap. Engineered floors use cross laminated plywood which is dimensionally stable so you can rethink all those trim details that hide the edges of your floating floor. That and it stays flat. How has the history of architecture and construction in the US resulted in multi million dollar houses being made with low quality materials There are certainly a lot of low quality materials in contemporary US homes (previous IAMA that discusses this but consider several factors: 1. The largest, by volume, thing that most people buy is a car. Think of how much it costs and how large it is. Now consider how many times larger a house is. If you paid the same price per pound, as Buckminster Fuller suggested and tried after WWII using idled airplane manufacturing facilities, or volume, even basic homes would cost many times what they currently cost. We need to use inexpensive materials because we need so much of them. Europe gets around this by having a large supply of existing high quality buildings (survivorship bias living in smaller spaces, having lower rates of home ownership, and accepting higher construction prices and longer payback periods for commercial buildings (at least in Germany which I\\'m more familiar with). 1. Inexpensive does not equal bad. Construction materials prior to the widespread use of iron and steel primarily only worked in compression. Think about that for a moment. Stone/masonry only really works in compression. That\\'s why you can\\'t build floors and roofs out of it easily. Wood works in compression and tension equally well and it’s light, renewable, easy to work, it’s warm to the touch, doesn’t transfer heat as rapidly as masonry, etc. It’s a fantastic building material. Every material we use is, in some sense, amazing at what it does. Think gypsum board (drywall is a trade name like Kleenex) is \"low quality?\" It stops sound well, it doesn\\'t burn, it\\'s flat, inexpensive, and it\\'s way faster to build with than plaster and lath. Every material has its place and when compared to what preceded it is typically incredible. I had to leave a lot out, so please feel free to ask questions.

       " 'This will be my first time posting an answer here – so I hope I get the format right, but I love vernacular architecture so thought I should have a go. Understanding vernacular architecture is about breaking down environmental considerations, material availability, competencies of the local workforce, and other social considerations (cultural and historical). So in this answer, I’d like to split this up into several areas along the lines of materials, competencies and social considerations, comparing the U.S. to Europe. All three are quite tightly linked and are as relevant an issue today as they were historical. So, in America, you have much wood. I mean, you have huge, ginormous amounts of wood, even after several centuries of deforesting for lumber and farmland, the US is still a massive exporter of lumber, both hard and soft (see USDA – global exports – lumber). That is just the exports, your domestic consumption is equally staggering (Bumgardner, Service and Luppold, 2016). If something is prevalent, it is going to be cheaper. Now, in recent years that begun to change as U.S. exports have been driving the price up a bit (ibid) as Chinese demand for U.S. lumber has skyrocketed. That might account for your observation that brick appears to be of similar value now. In Europe, aside from Scandinavian countries, the relative area of forest is around 30-40% (Forest Research, 2015). As you’ve noted, these places tend to have more brick or blockwork construction. As I’ve already alluded to the Scandinavian countries are quite different, boasting upwards of 70% forest density. In these areas, you would more commonly see wood construction more than brick or block. So comparatively, what is North America at? You only have 35% coverage, that’s in keeping with Europe… but that also equates to 2134 million hectares, which is very comparable with Europe, even with the Scandinavian and Russian influences adding to it. Better still, around 95% of your wood is native lumber (Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, 2020) what better to build your building with, than something that has, quite literally, grown up in that environment. In the case of the U.K., our forest density is very low at (13%) (ibid.). This scarcity drives up the prices, making it less appealing to work with. So, social considerations. The density of population can also be a major factor in things and something that can cause a large social change in the attractiveness of building buildings with certain types of materials. If you have high population densities, the attractiveness of lumber construction, decreases, particularly from the point of view of the local municipality. In the U.K., we’ve had some incidents (see a certain fire in 1666) that led to the wholesale destruction of a city and policy brought in that barred the use of wood from the city. If you have enough land between properties – this is less of an issue as the fire won’t spread between as easily. Going back to competencies, if you’ve just had a city rebuilt in brick and stone, you now have a population of builders who are familiar with this mode of construction. So let’s bring some figures in, in general, America, in comparison to Europe, has a far lower population density, both historically and even to today (around 36 people per Km2 compared to around 100-280 per Km2 of European nations (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2019). The other upshot of lower densities (obviously we are talking in general here, rather than say in the centre of cities) is that is cheaper so you can build bigger houses. Australia, Canada, America… top three for house size (Statista, 2017). WHICH IS AMAZING! Because so much of your population lives in the relatively higher density cities, in smaller abodes, that the average of your nation can be swayed by huge sizes elsewhere is just incredible. So what does this have to do with wood? Well… technology. The technological aspect that has kept wood very prevalent is that it’s harmonious with American technological advances in home heating over the past century in and a half. Two technologies. Air-injected heating and airconditioning. Let’s start with Air-injected heating. This is uncommon in Europe within vernacular architecture. That’s not to say that it not found, just that it is uncommon. There are many reasons why that was and still is the case but consider simply the space requirements. The amount of heat that water can carry around 4,000 times the heat energy as a similar volume of air, hence pipes are much smaller than ductwork. So going back to population densities and house sizes, if you have a smaller place, ideally you don’t want to be taking up more of it with large ducting. Secondly, it is much harder to retrofit ducting into brickwork houses that predate central heating (CIBSE – The Quest for comfort by Roberts is a great book on this that really drills down on how comfort systems evolved in the U.K. over the last). And, as central heating became prevalent in retrofitting, competencies were gained in installing hot water central heating, so it became the norm, that reinforced a method of vernacular construction. Water central heating doesn’t lend itself to another American vernacular technology that is very uncommon in central and Northern Europe - Air conditioning (see this cool article by the Smithsonian - at the bottom or Healy’s account ). Airconditioning is relatively easy to install if you have, lots of ducts and, it works best if you’re cooling people by blowing cool air instead of trying to cool the materials (Fanger, 1970) (think of your car’s blower). So, to summarise, why does America build in wood? Because you can build big, without (relatively) risking burning down your neighbours. It was and still is, plentiful, and you have a workforce that is very familiar with it. Your technology has evolved harmoniously with wood construction in a way that you have come to define, socially, as being comfortable (I recommend reading Goodchild et al. accounts of comfort practices in the U.K. for a comparison). These things reinforce each other, and as each new building is made, so to does it increase the likelihood that the next building built will be similar (see social practice theory for that). As a bonus, here is a wonderful video of British bricklaying by Pathe circa 1940’s - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldR3nrWhw8s References Bumgardner, M.S., Service, U.S.F. and Luppold, W.G.

       " 'First question I may be able to contribute to! Long time listener, first time caller so to speak. Some excellent answers here already, but I can contribute as well. While not directly involved in home construction, I am a housing finance professional (Capital Markets specifically, more traditionally known as Secondary Marketing) with frequent interaction with home construction professionals, appraisers and appraisal/valuation best practices, and market influences. As you might expect this is a complex issue with multiple possible contributing factors. I’d propose that the more appropriate question is “Why are some homes and buildings in the US made with low quality materials?” as it is certainly not true that 100% of US new construction homes are made from low quality materials. Neither is it true that European homes are exclusively made from high quality materials. It isn’t my goal to challenge the ‘fairness’ of your question, but I would like to address the ‘absolute’ nature of the phrasing a little bit. According to data from the UK government existing homes in the UK are impressively old. Roughly 37% of all homes were built around or before World War II (1944 or earlier). Only 15% of homes were built after 1990. Contrast that to the US where according to US census data roughly 17% of existing homes were built around or before World War II (1949 and earlier), and 33% of existing homes were built in 1990 or later. 2 This is important as it drives to the potential bias of your question. If construction materials in general are trending towards more inexpensive options due to supply, technological innovations, changes in building/environmental codes or economic factors on a global scale, that would have a more apparent effect in areas with higher concentrations of modern construction. Please note that statement is addressing my opinion of potential bias and its possible cause(s). My primary source material for European construction quality is too inadequate to make a declarative statement. While my anecdotal knowledge of new construction in Europe is that it is trending towards affordability, more research is needed. I think we should also address “Manufactured Homes”. Manufactured Homes can be considered ‘new construction’ depending on the speaker and the audience, but are typically pre-fabricated complete structures or pre-fabricated modular parts of a structure which are built off-site and then shipped and installed on the property. A typical manufactured home is designed to be as cost efficient as possible, current US Census data puts the average cost of a manufactured home at $88,200.00. Significantly below the 2019 median US single family home price of $321,500. 2 Notable exceptions aside, calling manufactured homes “cheap” may be insensitive but would probably not be considered unfair by a reasonable person. They are simply purpose-built, and that purpose is generally not to become a longstanding landmark or hurricane shelter. Note that material quality and square footage are not the sole factors in the value of manufactured homes. Laws vary by state and municipality, but manufactured homes are often subject to zoning restrictions that make them ineligible in affluent and high-property value areas. A major component in US home value and appraisals are “comparable values” or ‘comps’. If nearby comps are in less affluent neighborhoods perceived value will also drop. Note also that the descriptor “site-built” or “stick-built” is most often used to differentiate a manufactured home from contractor-built home that is fully assembled on site, and the commonly understood meaning of “building your own home” is site-built. Your question also asks about the US as a whole. It should be noted that this is ignoring a significant possible factor in both local home construction material and personal bias of perceived home construction quality. To briefly illustrate that point, going back to manufactured homes, they account for roughly 7.5% of all single family dwellings in the entire country. If we focus solely on Rhode Island that percentage drops to less than 2%. If we focus on Alabama that number jumps to close to 20%. There are many potential economic and social driving factors contributing to that difference in concentration which I will not attempt to address here. Unsurprisingly construction material quality factors will primary or indirectly revolve around the ROI or “Return on Investment”. Simply put, builders, home owners and the US government/local municipalities need to make sure new housing construction is profitable (Albacore_futures response addresses how important the economic role of housing finance and homeownership is in the US economy. Outside of pedantic nit-picking they pretty much nail it). This does not mean factors such as aesthetic, durability, and safety are not important, but the counter-balance to their importance is always cost. It is also critically important to understand how home value is determined. In the US a home’s value is determined by a licensed appraiser. These determinations have seen objectivity improvements thanks to regulations implemented in the fallout of the housing crisis of 2007/2008, but there remains a substantial amount of subjectivity in the process. Aside from notable exceptions known as “Appraisal waivers” or “Property Inspections Waivers” which are becoming increasingly common (primarily on refinance loans), an appraisal is required to obtain a mortgage on a home. Appraisers take all reasonable factors into consideration when making a determination. This does include construction materials. However, they also rely heavily on the ‘comps’ mentioned earlier. A valid comparable property typically needs to geographically close to the subject property but also as similar as possible in style and square footage. This means if you are building a home a larger square footage will generally increase both its inherent value the value of valid comparable homes. This leads us to the ROI judgement call, more affordable materials and a larger home, or more quality materials and a smaller home? Setting aside the profit and ROI motivations of development and construction companies, that answer may not be as simple as it seems for a private person building their own home. If the future homeowners are wealthy enough to fund the construction without the need for a secured loan it’s purely personal preference (outside of meeting local building codes and HOA regulations where applicable). However, if financing must be secured the cost of construction must be supported by the appraisers best estimate of final value for the bank or institution to lend the money and still meet regulatory requirements. To reiterate what other posters have said, less expensive housing materials does not mean cheap or dangerous. Will a pure titanium home with a high performance 50,000PSI concrete foundation last longer than more traditional timber construction and 2500PSI concrete? Certainly, but securing financing may be impossible and the traditional construction materials are likely more than adequate if properly maintained. Of course that example is hyperbole, but it is simply illustrating the balancing act involved in determining what materials to use. 1 (Department for Communities and Local Government “English Housing Survey Headline Report 20130-14”, Feb 2015 2 (2019 US Census “Characteristics of New Housing” Highlights',\n",
       " 'The evolution of federal law enforcement is largely the result of a longstanding wariness of the idea of a national police force. This is partly a function of federalism — state and local governments have long held primary responsibility for most law enforcement — but it also stems from a concern that a federal police force might evolve into a secret police organisation that could threaten the constitutional order and civil liberties. As a result, federal law enforcement agencies tend to be specialised, with relatively narrow mandates. In fact, for most of the US\\' history, the broadest law enforcement authority was likely held by the US Marshals — but they were organised and administered at the district court level, and didn\\'t have a centralised organisational structure until the creation of the US Marshals Service in 1969. Most federal law enforcement agencies were been created in direct response to contemporary issues and crises: the Secret Service, for example, was established in 1865 under the Department of the Treasury to combat currency counterfeiting, because an estimated third of all currency in circulation immediately after the Civil War was counterfeit (which represented a major threat to US economic stability.) The establishment of the DEA in 1973 was part of Nixon\\'s \\'war on drugs\\', in response to rising levels of drug abuse and growing public concern about drugs during the 1960s. The ATF has its roots in the Bureau of Internal Revenue\\'s enforcement units, and the Bureau of Prohibition created to enforce the Volstead Act; it gained its firearms mandate with the passage of the Gun Control Act in 1968 — a law whose passage was in large part a response to the Kennedy assassination. The FBI has long been the most controversial federal law enforcement agency, because it\\'s the closest to a true national police force. Created in 1908 to combat crime that crossed state lines, or that fell under federal jurisdiction but outside the direct purview of an existing agency, the Bureau of Investigation (as it was known until 1933) was immediately met with suspicion. During the First Red Scare (1918-20), the Bureau turned its attention to zealously targeting those it deemed radicals and subversives; its General Intelligence Division, led by a young bureaucrat named J. Edgar Hoover, conducted aggressive surveillance and harassment of suspected communists and anarchists. In 1924, when the Coolidge administration came to power, Attorney General Harlan Fiske Stone set to reforming the Bureau — in part because of the excesses of the Red Scare years, but also as part of an attempt to clean up the Department of Justice after the notoriously corrupt Harding administration. Stone immediately curbed the Bureau\\'s mandate, restricting it to strictly criminal enforcement (as opposed to political policing or counterintelligence) and telling the press: \"A secret police may become a menace to free government ... because it carries with it the possibility of abuses of power which are not always quickly apprehended or understood.\" (Quoted from The Boss: J. Edgar Hoover and the Great American Inquisition Thanks to a burgeoning reputation as an able administrator and arch-technocrat — and helped by his predecessor\\'s implication in Harding-era corruption — Hoover was named director of BOI. Thanks to Hoover\\'s gift for political manoeuvring and the BOI\\'s high-profile involvement in pursuing celebrity criminals like John Dillinger, the Bureau was expanded and renamed the FBI in 1935. Over the next 37 years, Hoover continued to enlarge the Bureau and broaden its scope — and in the process, became one of American history\\'s most sinister figures and realised some of the worst fears of civil libertarians about a federal police force — most notoriously, with the COINTELPRO campaign of the 1950s and 1960s. In 1975, the Church Committee, investigating abuses by US intelligence and law enforcement agencies, quoted Stone\\'s prediction in its final report adding: Our investigation has confirmed that warning. We have seen segments of our Government, in their attitudes and action, adopt tactics unworthy of a democracy, and occasionally reminiscent of the tactics of totalitarian regimes. We have seen a consistent pattern in which programs initiated with limited goals, such as preventing criminal violence or identifying foreign spies, were expanded to what witnesses characterized as \"vacuum cleaners\", sweeping in information about lawful activities of American citizens. In the 1990s, following a series of scandals in the ATF and DEA, Vice-President Al Gore proposed merging both agencies into the FBI but institutional interests and public opposition stalled the idea. Post-9/11, there was significant administrative reorganisation of federal law enforcement, with many agencies (the Secret Service, Customs and Border Protection, US Coast Guard) reshuffled to fall under the authority of the new Department of Homeland Security but there have not been serious efforts to merge agencies themselves — likely because there\\'s no political will or pressing operational reason to do so.

       " \"OK. Historically, television seasons started in September, then ran until January where they would adjust their lineups. Some shows would have an early cancellation and new shows would be slotted in. The rest of the season would run until June. June was pilot season when a lot of shows would be pitched to the networks for their fall lineup. They would run reruns over the summer, then launch the next season the following September. This overall formula started to change when Northern Exposure was launched as a new series during that summer window, and as it was the only new show on TV, it drew a higher audience than expected and it took off. &#x200B; Generally, shows picked up from pilot to series would be on a contingent basis. They would have 4-5 scripts ready and start filming fairly immediately so they would have them ready for the launch in September, then most of the shows would be filmed just a few weeks before airing. The networks would only pick up the first half of an entire season (approximately 13 episodes), then renew the second half half based on ratings. If they did not have the ratings, then they would pick up another series and launch it. Deep Space 9 was a second half series replacement with a launch date of January. It simply didn't have 26 weeks of programming before the summer schedule kicked in. Same thing happened with Voyager. Now, some of these shows were complicated by being syndication shows owned by the production company marketed to individual stations and networks, but the general framework was consistent. Star Trek: TNG's second season was cut short by a writer's strike. The math now is radically different. Seasons are much shorter and are now largely serial in dramas and science fiction, so they are more akin to the 1970's era Mini-series format. Some shows are specifically designed for extended second-run syndication. A television show still in production can generally also be marketed in the syndication market after 3 seasons, so there are ways to focus on that market. There are 13 weeks in a quarter year. Each week would have 5 daily episodes. So, a quarter worth of programming would be 65 episodes. So, producers generally want a minimum of 65 episodes over the first 3 seasons so that they can more easily slot into syndication scheduling. They'll lose a few days over the years, but that's a number they aim for. (If you look at the Disney teen lineup of shows like Even Stevens, Lizzie McGuire, etc, etc, you'll see they almost always stop right at 65 episodes, or just above that number. Lizzie McGuire was exactly 2 seasons, 65 episodes. Andi Mack is the only one I see coming in at 57 )\",\n",

       " 'Old Australian aboriginal martial arts are not described in detail. The main unarmed martial art which were observed was wrestling, and there appear to have been many different local types of wrestling (as expected, since this is a very common pattern worldwide). Other than wrestling, there was the use of traditional weapons such as the spear, spearthrower, club, boomerang, and shield. There was also the skill of avoiding spears by dodging. Techniques of using spearthrowers and boomerangs have survived into modern times, with their use as hunting weapons. There have been small-scale revivals/reconstructions of Aboriginal martial arts. These appear to be speculative reconstructions, based on general descriptions at most. Perhaps the best known of these is Coreeda, \"kangaroo spirit\" in the Ngiyambaa language, which began in 1998. Competition takes place in two distinct ways. First, there is a dance competition, which often resembles Capoeira. This is followed by sumo-like wrestling.

       " 'In short, the various Allied nations did utilize Submarine fleets in an unrestricted campaigns against the Axis Powers during World War Two. The Americans, the British, and Soviets all used Submarines in a variety of capacities in that war. As my focus is on the First, rather than the Second World War, there will be plenty of space for another user to tackle submarine usage in World War Two. My answer will, instead, focus on the the usage of submarines by the Allies during the First World War, and touch on the unrestricted campaigns run by the Germans. Germany was actually fairly late in developing a submarine arm. Other nations such as France and Spain had been testing submarines throughout the late 19th century, and during the 1890s truly workable military submarines had been designed (most notably by John Holland, residing in the United States).^1 The United States adopted submarines in 1900, with the Royal Navy adopting them the following year. The first German submarine wasn\\'t ready until 1906. So, the question of other countries adopting submarines isn’t the most productive one, as they had mostly done so before the Germans did. Now this brings us to the war itself. Submarines had proved useful to most Naval powers at the time. For example, among the first units of the Royal Navy to start war operations in 1914 were British Submarines sent to perform reconnaissance within the Helgioland Bight against the Germans.^2 The French, Italians, and British operated submarines in the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas. The British and Russians operated submarines in the Baltic Sea. The British and French operated submarines in the Sea of Marmara, while the Russians operated submarines in the Black Sea. The Americans would eventually operate submarines based out of the Azores Islands, Ireland, and the American East Coast. For the most part, what differentiated the submarines of the Central Powers from the submarines of the Allies were the kinds of operations they were used for. In the Allied anti-shipping campaigns, they attempted to utilize their submarines in a manner that reflected the “cruiser rules” of prize warfare. They would attempt to board Central Power ships and check their cargo, before deciding to either inter, sink, or let the vessel go. This is in comparison to the Central Powers who utilized an “unrestricted submarine campaign” which meant that vessels were liable to be sunk without warning, either by torpedo or deck gun. This is a pretty major difference. In some respects, an unrestricted campaign would be more successful than a restricted. However, you can not discount the effect that Allied submarines had on Central Power shipping and trade. For example, the campaign in the Sea of Marmara had a major effect on Ottoman supply lines during the Battle of Gallipoli and the citizens of Constantinople/Istanbul. While the Allies never completely shut down sea-borne transport lines, the Ottoman military shifted to a primarily land based route which wore down Ottoman troops involved in the long marches, and it additionally tied up transport vehicles to the Gallipoli front, negatively impacting their operations in other theaters such as the Caucasus or Palestine fronts. This, in many ways, can be read as a success by Allied submariners.^3 1915 and the Sea of Marmara did not see the only successes from Allied submariners. Central Powers shipping in the Baltic Sea was also disrupted, with, in the words of Norman Polmar,^4 In the Baltic, reinforced by British submarines, the Russian submarines had a substantial impact on the freedom of operation of the superior German fleet and seriously disrupted German merchant traffic, necessitating substantial reallocation of German naval resources to that theatre. Polmar is referencing, in part, the adoption of convoying by Central Powers ships in 1916 in the Baltic Sea as one way of protecting themselves from submarines. In 1916 the Allies did not sink any Central Powers vessel that was in a convoy. In the Black Sea, the Russians were able to almost entirely halt the Ottoman coastal trade with their submarines. So it’s safe to say that as an anti-shipping weapon, the Allies had a generally good handle on their submarines. Of course, the submarine never became the weapon of an economic war for the Allies as they were relying primarily on a surface blockade, enforced primarily by the Royal Navy. The Allies did not limit their submarine usage to anti-shipping campaigns. As I hinted at earlier, the Allies were using their submarines for reconnaissance and in an anti-submarine role, a forerunner to today’s “Hunter-Killer” submarines and tactics. In the North Sea, American and British submarines would be sent on patrol billets where they would be on the lookout for German U-Boats. These patrols were long and tedious, and in many cases did not result in sightings.^5 In the Adriatic Sea, the Italians and French used their submarines to attempt to raid Austro-Hungarian harbors and to sink Austro-Hungarian submarines.^6 None the less, the presence of Allied submarines was feared by both German submariners and German admirals. Submarines acted as one deterrent against the High Seas Fleet sallying out against the Allies, and German submariners were afraid that they too could be torpedoed at any moment. The presence of Allied submarines often caused the Germans to attempt to patrol in different areas with less Allied activity. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Finally, I’d like to tackle another assumption present in your question: The success of the German submarines during the First World War. There are two primary ways I think that this can be measured. Firstly, did they achieve their stated goals? Secondly, did they pose a credible threat to the Allies? On the first question they did not achieve their stated goals. The Germans intended to use the submarine in order to starve the United Kingdom into submission to sue for peace. This goal was lofty and I discuss the decision to launch the unrestricted campaigns here However, while they may not have achieved their stated goals, they did pose a credible threat to the Allies in which the Allies had to respond. The second unrestricted campaign led to the introduction of convoys and a major shifting of naval forces. Even the Japanese pitched in and sent destroyers to the Mediterranean. So, when qualifying the German submarine campaigns, it’s best to keep in mind that they did not achieve their ultimate goal but were a threat. If you\\'d like to read some more about Allied submarine operations during the First World War, I have written about the Americans here and the Allies more broadly here Sources: 1: Some resources on American submarine development include U.S. Submarines Through 1945: An Illustrated Design History by Norman Freidman, The American Submarine by Norman Polmar, and Building American Submarines 1914-1940 by Gary E.

       " \"If you're interested in reading about this topic in depth, I would recommend War Beneath the Sea, by Padfield. It's a fairly exhaustive single volume book that examines the development, doctrine, and performance of submarine fleets for all of the major powers who fought in WW II. I think the German submarine force gets so much focus because 1) it was indeed very good, but 2) there wasn't much going on with the German surface fleet in WW II. Outside of some commerce raiding of little strategic impact and a couple of well known engagements (Bismark), the RN successfully maintained naval dominance above the waves. Towards the end of course Germany disbanded many of its surface units and reformed them into new infantry divisions, which tells you how unimportant the German surface fleet had become. It was the submarine force that had an actual strategic impact on the war, therefore it gets a lot of publicity (much of it deserved). The British invested heavily in submarines prior to WW II (though their designs left something to be desired), but the story of the Royal Navy in WW II is so much broader than the submarine fleet. And of course the British submarine fleet could hardly be strategically decisive against a foe like Germany (although they had plenty of action and success against the Italians in the Med.). The US similarly invested heavily in submarines, and arguably built the best submarines of any major nation of WW II (although regrettably, with some of the worst torpedoes). Large and technologically advanced submarines with good range and important quality of life features like air conditioning that allowed them to have great endurance, important for a nation that had to cover vast distances in the Atlantic and Pacific. And of course US submarines arguably had the most decisive strategic impact of any sub fleet of the war, almost single handedly bringing Japanese shipping to its knees. But again, the story of the USN in WW II is much bigger than just the submarine fleet, so it doesn't stand alone as much as the German story.\",\n",
       " 'As others have mentioned, other powers did in fact invest in submarines; in particular, the US submarine campaign against Japanese merchant shipping was immensely successful and a big part of the reason the Home Islands were so badly supplied in 1945 - recall that the Japanese still controlled large parts of China, but they couldn\\'t ship the rice across to feed their home front. In \"Embracing Defeat\", John Dower relates how, after the war ended, rationing in Japan was still so strict that a judge, feeling he had to uphold the law in his personal life, literally starved to death trying to live on his official ration; that tells you something about how badly the Japanese merchant marine, on which their imports presumably depended, had been hit. However, I would raise a point which neither of the two previous answers mentioned (perhaps thinking it too obvious): Submarine warfare is the weapon of the weaker power. A navy that has the ability to send cruisers to patrol their enemy\\'s lines of communications doesn\\'t need to bother with submarines; a heavy cruiser - much less a battleship! - can sink or capture a whole convoy in an hour\\'s gunnery. By contrast, even the most disastrous (for the Allies) convoy battles of WWII were drawn-out attritional affairs where a good fraction of the convoy always got through. Consider SC7, for example, in October 1940: No air cover, escorted by only a single small warship, and attacked by a wolfpack of 7 U-boats. This convoy lost 20 of its 35 ships; it was perhaps the worst convoy battle of the whole war (the other obvious candidate is PQ17, 23 ships sunk of 34). And still, 15 ships did reach England! Tirpitz, or even Scharnhorst, would have sunk, or worse captured, the whole lot, because there\\'s no way for the slow merchant ships to get out of range of those heavy guns before they\\'re hit - and since they know that perfectly well, they\\'ll surrender. This is why the Bismarck and the Tirpitz could affect the whole deployment of the Royal Navy\\'s battleships, and why the threat of a \"breakout into the Atlantic\" loomed so large in the operations of the Royal Navy until they were both sunk. An enemy battleship on the loose in the Atlantic threatened their whole trade in a way that almost no amount of submarines could do. In his history of the war, Churchill mentions the possibility that they\\'d have to provide a battleship escort to every convoy, to fight the Tirpitz on reasonably even terms; you can imagine the strain that would have put on their operations. So one reason the British didn\\'t build a large submarine fleet for purposes of commerce raiding (they did build a medium-sized one for operations against enemy warships) was that they had no need to: They could put six cruisers in the British Channel and a dozen patrolling the North Sea, and boom, Germany can\\'t import anything by ship any more. (Exceptions for coastal traffic along Norway, and across the Baltic from Finland and Sweden - the cruisers can\\'t go there, whether because of mines and land-based aircraft, or because they can\\'t get through the Sound). No need for submarines - there\\'s no targets for them! A digression: The US was not \"the weaker power\" overall in the Pacific against Japan; but they were locally weaker in the seas surrounding the Home Islands. It would be quite late in the war before an American task force could get into those bodies of water. So for that specific part of the sea, the Americans used commerce raiding, and very successfully too. This discussion is not specific to submarines; it goes back to the guerre de course and jeune ecole (respectively \"commerce warfare\" and \"young school\") concepts of the nineteenth century, and arguably to privateering and commerce raiding in the Franco-English wars from Westphalia to Napoleon. As you can perhaps tell from the names, these concepts arose in the French navy, discussing how they could overcome what was by then the apparently invincible dominance of the Royal Navy. The French were resigned to having fewer battleships, and being unable to gain a traditional command of the sea by just smashing the enemy fleet in a decisive battle, and then having the ability to send their cruisers wherever they wanted. (Conversely, this is the scenario that the Royal Navy always worried the most about, and the consensus on their side was that if they ever lost command of the sea in this way, they would have to make \"peace on whatever terms we can get\" - Sir Julian Corbett expresses that view in \"Some Principles of Maritime Strategy\", for example.) So the \"jeune ecole\" was the view that the French should instead build a large number of small, fast raiding ships, able to run away from a British cruiser, but heavily enough armed to smash up a convoy escort and the convoy. The French Navy never did get enough funding to build that fleet, but you can see that it\\'s basically the same concept as building a large number of submarines that can hide from a cruiser. Either way it is the weapon of a power that can\\'t afford a big enough navy to fight a decisive battle and gain the ability to put cruisers on arbitrary sea lanes; it\\'s the oceanic equivalent of guerilla warfare - you run away from big enemy armies, and strike where they are weak. So, to summarise: The victor powers of WWI did not invest heavily in submarines for commerce raiding because they expected to have command of the sea in the next war. They felt no need for a \"guerrilla\" force to deny use of the sea lanes to their enemies, when their \"regular\" (ie surface) navies expected to easily control them - and were largely correct in that expectation; there were no convoys running into German-controlled ports.',\n",
       " 'Not an expert but I have studied Soviet history and come from a family from the former Soviet Union. So first of all the word товарищ does translate to \"comrade\" but it has a different connotation in Russian. Whereas in English \"comrade\" sounds somewhat militaristic and is almost unilaterally associated with the left, in Russian the word товарищ has connotations that make it closer to the English word \"companion\" or, at a stretch, even \"friend\". As a child, it was normal for my grandfather to ask me if I was going to hang out with my \"comrades\" in Russian, and it was meant in the context of friends (this was in the US, mind you). So the word itself sounds a little less overtly political in Russian. As to how common it was to greet your neighbors and so on, the answer is very common. It was used to refer to strangers if you were trying to get their attention for example, along with other words like гражданин (\"citizen\"). It was used in place of the English Mr./Mrs./Ms. so where in English you would say Mr. Jones or Mrs. Smith, in the USSR you would say Comrade Jones and Comrade Smith (although in formal contexts, the correct way to refer to someone would be with their Name and Patronym). Likewise, in Russian when referring to officials its common to put a courtesy title in front of their actual title. Nowadays, and before the USSR this was usually the word господин (\"lord\" or \"sire\" literally, but closer to \"mister\" in connotation) so you would refer to a General as \"Lord General\" or a Professor as \"Lord Professor\" (this is literally, but a better translation would be Mister General or Mister Professor, like how in the US we say Mister President). In the USSR, \"comrade\" took the place of those courtesy titles so the normal way to refer to people was \"Comrade General\" and \"Comrade Professor\". So in short, the phrase was very common and used in a wide variety of contexts.',\n",

So in a strictly noble context \"lords and ladies\" would be appropriate whereas if applied strictly to members of the gentry \"ladies and gentlemen\" would be accurate. In the US the latter is common while the former is not because we have no acknowledged titles of nobility and qualifications for the status of \"gentleman\" are a bit vague. So it\\'s an acceptable assumption / compliment. tl/dr In places where there are still lords it really didn\\'t change',\n",
       " \"There's a lot to unpack here, because in lots of ways 'death culture' is just... culture in this period. Beliefs about death have far-reaching cultural impacts. This answer will focus on tombs and epitaphs because that's my jam, but feel free to ask me if there's anything else you'd like to see addressed. I'll also add the caveat that the period I know the most about begins during Queen Elizabeth's reign, so my answer is coloured by this. Reformation was not a linear process, and those early years of the Reformation in England when William Tracy passed away are theologically messy - by the time we get to the kind of material culture I'm working with, a lot of the beliefs about the dead were beginning to coalesce into a fairly agreed-upon set of principles. Epitaphs Justification by faith, or 'sola fide' is a difficult one to pick apart because even after the Reformation it still stays very tied to the doctrine it is most commonly seen as working against, 'justification by works'. Reformed doctrine claims that redemption comes through faith, but there is also an expectation that one of the effects of a strong faith will be good works. Some late medieval/early renaissance epitaphs that are popular in printed collections as well as manuscript demonstrate this focus on works, for example: Citizens of London call to your remembrance the famous Iohn Rainwell sometime your maior, of the staple of Callis, so was his chance here lieth now his corps, his soule bright & faire is taken to heauens blisse, thereof is no dispaire his acts beare witnis, by matters of recorde how charitable he was, & of what accorde no man hath bin so beneficiall as hee vnto the Citie in giuing liberalitie./ (Camridge University Library, MS Add 9221, fol98r) Rainwell died in 1445 and this is a pretty typical epitaph wherein his salvation is directly tied to the charitable works undertaken in his home city. Compare for example, an epitaph for one Lady Frevile who died in 1630. The poet ('Mister Robert Burrell, minister of Gaynford') tells us 'Great was her wealth, great was her witt, her piety passed both' - emphasising Frevile's piety over other concerns, as one might expect. Nonetheless, the poem continues: The mother did good works begyn; the daughter she succeeded, two patternes to posterity; let all behold & heed it. Good works I call good works indeed; let showes & shadowes goe; Obedience vnto God & man are they, or els I do not know: If some saie Hospitality, the common good & poore, then let him name, one like in these, I will not vrge it more: (BL Egerton 2877, fol106r). Good works sit alongside faith here, with one being evidence of the other. Texts speaking so approvingly of justification by faith would have been radical at the time William Tracy died - but even in clearly 'reformed' texts, we still see comfort taken in evidence of works alongside faith. The relationship between these two tenets of faith remains muddy, and a hard and fast transition from 'works' to 'faith' doesn't take place. Where we do see a big shift in memorial culture is in the suggestion that faith will be sufficient to go straight to heaven as Puragatory was dropped from orthodox doctrine as part of the Reformation. Pre-reformation epitaphs focusing on good works might also ask passers by to pray for the dead - an act of charity that would assist the dead in passing from purgatory to heaven. An epitaph for Steven Forster and his wife Agnes (d. 1458 and 1484 respectively) highlights Agnes' charitable works as a prison reformer, but also emphasises the need for prayers from the living: Deuout soules that passe this way for Stephen fforster late maior hartily pray & dame Agnes his spouse, to God consecrate, that of pitie this house made for Londoners in Ludgate so that for lodging and water prisoners here nought pay as their keepers place all answere at dreadfull doomesday (CUL Add MS 9221, fol98r) Agnes Forster is well worth an essay in her own right, but for our purposes, what's important is that combined emphasis on good works and the need for prayer. By comparison, here's an extremely popular epitaph that appeared on a grave, and circulated in manuscript in the 1620s: Twyce twelue yeares not full told, a weary breath I haue exchanged for a wished death. my Course was short, the longer is my rest, God takes them soonest whom he loueth best! For he that’s borne today & dyes tomorrow, Looseth some dayes of mirth, but month’s of sorrow./ (CUL Add 4138, fol23r) Here we have the dead subject speaking us to tell us that they are glad to have died because they have been taken directly to heaven, having lived a short but faithful life, with no emphasis on good works at all. Faithfulness and an anticipation of the afterlife are all that is required. These 'happy dead' epitaphs become more and more common as the living are reminded that they should celebrate the passing of the faithful dead. Thomas Becon's famous ars moriendi ('the art of dying'), 'The Sycke Mans Salue' tells us that ‘I think that at the burials of the faithfull, there shuld rather be ioy & gladnes, then mourning and sadnes, rather pleasant songes of thankesgeuing: then lamentable and doleful diriges’. The culture of death here has shifted from works to faith, and as a consequence, the response expected from the living is qualitatively different, demanding that the fellow-faithful be happy at their co-religionist's passing.\",\n",
       " 'He did write extensively on many topics. The volume _Ideas and Opinions_ contains a wealth of articles, letters, editorials, speeches, and so on that he gave on philosophy, religion, politics, and numerous other topics separate from physics and mathematics. So the idea that Einstein would have deep opinions on many things other than, say, General Relativity, is not ill-founded. During his life, especially after he moved to the United States, his opinions were routinely solicited by newspapers and magazines, as he became the stand-in for \"the smartest person alive.\" And both during and after his life, \"Einstein witticisms and jokes\" became a common staple of people\\'s memories of him. Which is just to say, it\\'s not a crazy thing that he might have had a lot of varied opinions. He wasn\\'t as \"constrained\" as some famous \"geniuses\" have been. That being said, a lot of the fake quotes attributed to him are pretty banal, and he was never banal.',\n",
       " 'I don\\'t think the above answers adequately address your question. Einstein became a celebrity soon after arriving in the U.S. and was constantly hounded by the press. Over time he came to enjoy the attention somewhat and ascertain how best to respond to it. In his recent biography of Einstein, \"Einstein, His Life and Universe\", Walter Isaacson wrote: \"Einstein had just the right ingredients to be transformed into a star. Reporters, knowing that the public was yearning for a refreshing international celebrity, were thrilled that the newly discovered genius was not a drab or reserved academic. Instead, he was a charming 40-year-old, just passing from handsome to distinctive, with a wild burst of hair, rumpled informality, twinkling eyes, and a willingness to dispense wisdom in bite-sized quips and quotes.\" We can get idea of Einstein\\'s own reaction to this attention via the novelist C.P. Snow who got to know him well: \"There was a streak in him that enjoyed the photographers and the crowds, He had an element of the exhibitionist and the ham. If there had not been that element, there would have been no photographers and no crowds. Nothing is easier to avoid than publicity. If one genuinely doesn’t want it, one doesn’t get it.”',\n",
       " 'There\\'s an older-but-still-good post by /u/Irishfafnir/ about the regard for Jackson\\'s ranking by historians. It\\'s possible you\\'re thinking in more cultural-evolution terms, which case I\\'ll point you to this answer of mine about 1950s textbooks and the Trail of Tears Quoting the relevant portion: ... a great of many of the textbooks explicitly were trying to be progressive, it\\'s just their focus was elsewhere. Where this can be most clearly seen is a 1959 book by E. Merrill Root with the eye-popping title of Brainwashing in the high schools; an examination of eleven American history textbooks. The author\\'s thesis is that textbook authors of the 50s leaned hard to introducing collectivist ideas and claims outright the presence of Communist brainwashing. As sensational as Root\\'s pitch was (it is almost a perfect time capsule of the Second Red Scare) it is true the labor movement started to get more space; a review of one of the more popular textbooks of the era (originally published in the 40s but used through the 50s) states \"Since the progressive movement has all too frequently been shunted to a small space in high-school textbooks in American history, it is gratifying to see, especially in a book for the senior level, a complete unit devoted to this crucial phase of American history.\" This had the odd side effect of Jackson being portrayed in a positive light (Root calls him the \"darling\" of the \"liberals\"). Jackson, at least as perceived at this time, was a \"man of the people\", and as an \"anti-establishment\" candidate. Thus, even if it weren\\'t for the issues I cited earlier, the textbook authors were focused too much on that aspect to want to linger on the full horror of the Trail of Tears. For a time, Jackson stood in as an exemplar of standing up against the establishment, and this was what progressives focused on in the 1950s, so they were willing to overlook his treatment of Native Americans. This did not go unnoticed at the time; Root in the book I mentioned rakes progressives over for betraying their ideals. This was slowly chipped away at so that by the end of the 1970s Jackson could be a straight-up villian in the most progressive texts (Zinn\\'s A People\\'s History of the United States was 1980) but mainstream textbooks have a lag, and despite all that Jackson still has notable accomplishments and historians include both good and bad in their assessments.',\n",
       " \"Hello, I wrote an answer here about some of the difficulties in trying to put a concrete value on land using the valuations listed in contemporary sources like Domesday Book. As I noted in that answer, the current consensus is that those values listed for property in Domesday Book most likely represent an estimate of the value of the income specifically to the land-holder/tenant-in-chief in terms of rent, rather than an estimate of the total value of the land itself. So if anything, this is more pertinent data for answering your question, as it appertains to the landlord's income. Of course, this is complicated by the fact that those values may well represent the equivalent value in service obligation on manorial land, or goods rendered, as much as they might be actual sums of money. In following centuries, your tenants would likely be copyholders, but at this point, the terms and obligations of their tenancies would likely be a combination of common law privileges and discrete relationships agreed with each household based on their means and trade. This means that there wasn't necessarily a standard level of rent: an arable farmer may be obliged to work, say, 4 days a month on manorial land, while a sheep farmer may be liable for a certain amount of wool, sheepskin and mutton, or a livestock farmer to supply two calves a year and a certain volume of milk. Where tenants diversified their holdings, a more representative rent might be agreed. Two further questions arise: how is your population of 120 represented in terms of production, and do these income figures reflect your manorial appurtenances? Appurtenances are all of the various facilities and amenities attached to your manor: mills, apiaries, meadows, pasture, forest, fish stocks and so forth. These could significantly affect your income. For example, villagers who want to use the mill would typically pay a 'multure' fee to do so, most commonly taken in kind as a portion of the flour. Some of this would probably go to the miller as pay, while some may then pass to you as landlord. The multure rate would be at your discretion; in Chester, the multure for nearby farmers to use the city's mills was 15%, and perhaps unsurprisingly there was frequent complaint of farmers under-paying. At Wareham in Dorset, the mill charged a more reasonable multure of 10%. So let's look at the footprint of your population. Drawing accurate population figures from contemporary sources is always contentious. After all, contemporary records were typically preoccupied with taxable income rather than an accurate census count. Indeed, Domesday counts on the basis of 'households', and has been estimated to have under-counted due to omissions anywhere between 5% and 20% of the population. Indeed, while the consensus for the average size of a 'household' is somewhere around 5 individuals, various estimates count as low as 3 or even as high as 8 people within an 'average' household. 120 people could therefore theoretically represent as many as 40 or as few as 15 households, but let's use the law of averages and say that 120 people is around 25 households. There's a good chance that some of these households would have been omitted from the Domesday count by virtue of not working land; these could include the miller, any herdsmen who tend to communal herds or flocks, day labourers, and carpenters and blacksmiths and other craftsmen. In terms of land-holding tenants, then, let's estimate around 20 households. Now, if we're in the latter 12th century, you're unlikely to have any slave households, but similarly you're unlikely to have villages inhabited by just villeins or just smallholders. If we use the approximate proportions from Domesday Book, we'll say you've got 12 villeins or 'villagers, and 8 smallholders, cottagers and bordars. Villeins typically held around a virgate of land, a quarter of a 'hide' or 'ploughland'. Hides were predominantly assessed in terms of productive capacity rather than as discrete geographical units, but can be roughly approximated at about 120 acres. A villager or villein therefore would hold around 30 acres. There were various classes of smallholder but broadly speaking we could estimate them to hold somewhere between 5 and 15 acres, but in a more settled village we'll say 15. A population of 12 villein households and 8 smallholders could therefore roughly be reckoned to be working about 4 hides of land, around some 480 acres. A very, very, incredibly rough estimation from Domesday is that a ploughland provides about a pound of rental income per annum. If we hold our rough calculation of about 4 ploughlands per village across all three of your villages, therefore, you could expect a rough annuity of about 12 pounds, plus income from manorial lands and appurtenances.\",\n",
       " 'Boy, where to begin.... For a start, the Spanish brought peaches, honeybees (most people don\\'t realize those are an introduced species), and sheep and goats, all of which became bedrock cultural items for the Navajo and a few other Southwest tribes. To this day, Navajo and \"mutton\" or \"wool\" are all-but synonymous in certain trade circles, and I can tell you from experience that peaches and watermelons grown by Southwest tribes are ubiquitous and excellent. Bee-keeping doesn\\'t appear to have endured much into the modern era. Cows are another big one. Anybody else who lives in the intermountain west knows that cows basically rule the land, and most people with a bit of historical knowledge know that bison were exterminated to make room for them (to a point; it was also to cut off the Indigenous food/pelt supply). So, many tribal folks took to herding cows; it was that or abandon the land to find work in cities. Many of the grazing leases in the Four Corners are held by Utes, and a lot of Paiute families graze between there and California. With this came the adoption of beef steak, milk products, and so on. The biggest part of this story, however, are the food items that were forced onto people. On early reservations and in literal concentration camps like Bosque Redondo, where the Navajo were forced to live for a while, growing or foraging for their traditional foods wasn\\'t really possible. Instead they were given rations of white sugar, white flour, white lard, white milk, and so on. (Noticing a theme? That\\'s no accident. Whiteness was associated with good health and purity, going back to European notions that compelled people to do things like powder their skin until they looked like porcelain dolls.) They adapted as best they could, and the longest-standing result is probably the most universal \"Native American\" food dish in most people\\'s minds today: Indian fry-bread. This is why Indigenous-food traditionalists like Sean Sherman in his excellent book The Sioux Chef\\'s Indigenous Kitchen basically despise the stuff. That\\'s a sample, anyway.

       " 'I am Portuguese myself and I think I can answer this question. First and foremost Portuguese food is not at all that hot. Spice in portuguese translates to “Especiaria” and includes everything from black pepper, cumin, red bell pepper or “colorau” to cinnamon and bay leaves. None of this spices which are the most used are “spicy” or hot (maybe black pepper) and almost none of them are used in the most famous dishes. Although our pastries use a lot of cinnamon you can hardly find any other spice in the most famous dishes from Portugal like Codfish or Cozido à Portuguesa (Portuguese Stew) or the Caldo Verde (a type of soup). You can find some stronger spices if you call them that in Bifanas that use paprika or in the famous Francesinha. You might be right when you say that the Spanish use much less spices than us though. That’s because Spanish cuisine was strongly influenced by the French in the 19th century and they do not rely as heavily on spices to season their food. As this article states: The 19th century was one of great French influence in the Spanish cooking, due to many factors, including the Bourbon ruling dynasty who decided what was cooked in the courts kitchens. In many cases French recipe books were translated to Spanish while in France a renovation of the culinary arts called cuisine classique. So basically gastronomic customs are interchangeable much like any other form of culture and while the Spanish were heavily influenced by the French, the Portuguese did not want anything to with them as we were invaded several times by Napoleons generals. I could go much more in depth as this is a vast subject but I hope you find this reply satisfactory.',\n",
       " 'It sounds to me like farmer Smith is calling upon the knacker! Animals dying on farms was such a common occurance that a specialized job for it was a common occupation, even from the middle ages onward to the present day! The knacker (let\\'s call him Cutter, cuz we\\'ve already named the farmer) would bring along his cart, load up the carcass (almost always whole, but I suppose he might be able to break it down a little bit into more manageable chunks if it was an especially large equine), and take it back to his residence, the knacker yard, for rendering into various products and raw materials. Cutter lives on the outskirts of town, partly because his job was considered very \"dirty\" and lower-class, but, more practically, because the techniques he used tended to be exceptionally smelly. It would ruin the pastoral aesthetic if you could smell tanning vats, crematoriums, and any decomposing animals the knacker hadn\\'t got to yet. No part of the horse went to waste! The meat could be used as feed at farms for various carnivorous animals like dogs, pigs, and foxes (note: meat from the knacker was NEVER used for human consumption); the hides could be sold to the local tanner for leather making if the knacker didn\\'t already have the facilities on hand; the hooves could be processed into animal glue, which would be supplanted fully by the chemical glue we use nowadays until the 20th century; hell, even the bones were ground up and used as bone meal fertilizer! Cutter had a difficult, smelly job, but it was an essential one. Animals died frequently at farms, and most weren\\'t raised with human consumption in mind. It was also a very lonely one. Nobody liked the local knacker, and his uncleanliness of a job often led him to also take contract work as a locality\\'s executioner. The job had a similar social stigma as the knacker, and it usually paid reasonably well. It became a very common occurance for the knacker and the executioner to be one and the same person, though I can only imagine the most introverted and misanthropic people could thrive in the dual postion...

The south and the democrats on the other hand was obviously heavy agriculture based and appealed to more farmers and poor southerners and immigrants. One reason the Irish leaned so heavily Democrat is because they worked a lot of the low income jobs that nobody wanted and they thought if the slaves were free they’d move north and replace them.

       " 'At least in particular moments and places of medieval Europe: yes! A few important caveats. “Medieval Europe” is a vast cultural, geographical, and temporal container. Between roughly 500 and 1500 CE, Europe was inhabited by an immense diversity of people holding an immense diversity of cultural beliefs. While the populations of Europe were predominantly Christian for most of this period, there were plenty of Jews, Muslims, various pagans groups, heterodox believers of all stripes, and others. All of these groups held differing (if frequently interrelated and cross-pollinating) perspectives on large, reptilian beasts. On that note, there is a tendency--especially in popular works, but even in certain academic fields--to collapse all scaly, semi-legendary monsters into a single, cross-cultural category of “dragon.” But doing so is problematic, as these creatures can play widely differing roles across (and within!) cultures. You may be familiar with a dichotomy between the vicious, adversarial “Western” dragon and the wise, beneficent “Eastern” dragon; but even this scheme falls apart upon closer analysis, with a huge degree of local variation that undermines any notion of a monolithic “West” and “East.” Furthermore, there’s no particular validity to the English (from Greek, via Latin and French) “dragon” as a useful catch-all for these beings, since that word has particular cultural resonances that don’t always apply. So, with those in mind, I’ll focus on some of the ways that Christian Europeans, from about the 8th century onwards, thought about menacing, large reptilian creatures (dracones, in Latin). Since dragons appeared in the (Vulgate) Bible and other authoritative religious texts, there was little doubt that they were, or at least had been, real creatures. Even if many of the Biblical references, such as those in Revelations, were generally read allegorically, a physical referent was widely assumed. The Etymologies of Isidore of Seville, written in the early 7th century, were a major reference work throughout the European Middle Ages. Isidore describes the draco in Book XII, in a subsection called “De serpentibus” (“On Serpents”), where it’s discussed between the coluber (essentially a grass snake) and the basiliscus, another semi-legendary creature that may draw on accounts of cobras, especially spitting cobras. Isidore’s draco has some fantastic qualities--it flies and consumes elephants--but essentially seems to represent a sort of large python. It hisses, constricts its prey to death without using venom, and dwells in Ethiopia and India. As that not-inaccurate geographical note suggests, there was a widespread belief among medieval European Christians that dragons were largely a feature of bygone eras and/or distant lands. The majority of medieval accounts of reptilian monsters are placed in those settings, including both of those you cite: St. George’s famous encounter was believed to have taken place in 3rd century Libya, about a thousand years before it became a popular story among European Catholics. Similarly, Sigurd’s feat was thought to have occurred in a largely mythic Germanic heroic era (very loosely encompassing the 4th through 9th centuries CE), though the canonical account in the Völsunga saga is from the late 13th century. (Though that said, there is plenty of evidence that stories of Sigurd, and the cognate figure Siegfried, were being told in various forms significantly before that.) In fact, this venerable antiquity was often an important feature of the stories. Saint Martha’s taming of the Tarasque, near Tarascon in southern France, was part of a storytelling tradition linking Provence to the Holy Family and an early adoption of Christianity. Many of the knightly dragon-slaying legends from England, such as John Conyers’ battle against the Sockburn Worm, were connected to questions of noble authority; the sword that Conyers allegedly used in this fight figured prominently in rituals connected to the investiture of the Bishops of Durham, signalling a deep-rooted alliance of royal, ecclesiastical, and aristocratic power. Contemporary dragons--and contemporary dragon-slayers--would have been significantly harder to fit into such schemes. Though visiting the past was generally considered difficult, visiting foreign lands was done, at least occasionally. And while I’m unaware of any expeditions launched specifically to find dragons, numerous European travelers--perhaps most famously Marco Polo--reported encountering them in distant lands, thus reinforcing existing notions of where such creatures lived. But there are nonetheless a number of surviving accounts that position dragons or dragon-like beasts within medieval Europe. One of the most earliest and best-known is the reference in some manuscripts of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, under the year 793: “fyrenne dracan wæron gesewene on þam lifte fleogende” (“fiery dragons were seen flying across the firmament,” to borrow James Ingram’s evocative translation.) This entry is principally about the Norse raid on the monastery at Lindisfarne in that year, with the fiery dragons only one in a litany of dire omens presaging this traumatic event. Most scholars understand this as a reference to meteors and/or comets. Many premodern cultures considered these to be signs of disaster, disrupting as they did the divine celestial order of the “fixed” stars, and sometimes explicitly spreading plague and famine in their wake. With such dragons, there obviously wasn’t really any question of confronting them; only preparing oneself, through prayer or other means, for whatever troubles they foretold. Almost at the other end of the Middle Ages, there’s a notice in the Annales Henrici Quarti (Annals of Henry IV), for the year 1405, of an enormous draco appearing near the village of Bures in Suffolk, England. This is a more tangible beast than the fiery sky-dragons; it kills a shepherd and a number of sheep, and its metallic scales repel arrows. However, threatened by a general muster of the countryside, it flees into the swamps and is not heard from again. A number of popular accounts of this event claim that the creature in question was a crocodile brought back from the Crusades, which was kept in a menagerie (perhaps the Tower of London) and then escaped into the fens. But 1405 is far too late for crusader crocodiles; and this understanding of the event has a distinctly euhemerist slant to it, attempting to explain features of a different belief system in terms legible to modern, scientific rationalism. Rather than trying to explain away the dragon of Bures, it is more fruitful to understand it in the context of its time. The first decade of the 15th century in England was a time of considerable civil unrest and crises over royal authority. The Bures dragon, and the valiant local militia who confront it, tell a story particular to that context. In these two accounts of dragons in England, over 600 years apart, common concerns surface about the relationship between danger, authority, and the natural world. In his 2006 The Royal Hunt in Eurasian History, Thomas T. Allsen constructs a lengthy cultural genealogy that links aristocratic power to their ability to counter and/or control chaotic natural forces, a drama ritualized in the royal hunt and its associated iconography. Dragons, for Allsen, are a kind of metaphoric extreme of such forces. So while medieval kings did not necessarily see the physical power of dragons as an existential threat to their kingdoms--a single shepherd isn’t much of a loss, after all--the symbolic power of dragons could be very important indeed. Nor was this always negative. Eighty years after the monstrous reptile appeared in Bures, Henry Tudor rallied his forces under banners including the red dragon of Wales (Y Ddraig Goch)--a beast with complex cultural resonances--in his successful attempt to win the English throne from Richard III. Another significant body of encounters relates to sea monsters, which were sometimes equated or compared to dragons (and endured somewhat longer in both popular and learned belief). But that’s a whole other can of wyrms. I hope this was helpful! Please let me know if I can provide any other sources, examples, or follow-ups.',\n",
       " \"I don't know if there is any English language source that would tell us the precise loading of a Swedish musket in the 17th and 18th century, but it largely doesn't matter. The m/1704 musket was very similar to every other main line smoothbore infantry weapon from the invention of the flintlock in the mid 1600s to the invention of the Minie ball in the early 1800s. It fired a 20mm lead ball weighing about 500 grains (32g) with about 100 grains (6.5g) of blackpowder behind it. Typically, these lead balls are undersized compared with the bore to allow quicker loading. The resultant projectile had a muzzle energy of about 3-4000 joules. For comparison's sake, the modern 5.56mm NATO XM193 55gr loading fires a 55 grain copper-jacketed lead bullet at 1755 joules. The obvious downsides of the 17/18th century musket is its accuracy and rate of fire. These muskets were smooth bore, had no sights worth writing home about, if any, and there was large variations of projectile weight and powder weight. You couldn't expect to hit anything you intended to hit beyond 100 yards, and contemporary doctrine fired at much shorter ranges. Swedish Ga-Pa doctrine, for which the Caroleans were famous, called for a first volley at 50 meters by part of the formation and then another at 20 by the rest, before charging in with rapiers, pikes and bayonets. Aiming was not a part of the procedure; you fired into the masses and if the god you believed in willed it and the god they believed it didn't, the bullet would find its mark. A hit from a musket ball was devastating. It would tear a hole in your body about an inch wide, most likely clear through, and possibly into your mate standing behind you. However, what made the Caroleans feared by their contemporaries wasn't the deadliness of fast moving lead, but their previously mentioned doctrine. A coordinated volley at short range is extremely loud, and would cover the front of engagement with smoke, and while you are disoriented by the sound, the fury and potentially the gaping hole in your chest, the Swedes are all upon you with religious fervour and sharp sticks that you would very much prefer to remain external to your anatomy. In summary, no more or less deadly than any other infantry weapon of the time, but you certainly wouldn't want to get hit by one.\",\n",
       " \"Ok I'll bite since it is quiet The impact of literature on a people is recognized as far back as Plato (especially book 3 of the republic). Plato realizes that people emulate models - even imaginary ones. Our powers of imagination are such that imaginary objects have existence even though they are not real (imagine for example a young boy secretly in love with the heroine of a comic, or Don Quijote - an imaginary character who makes another imaginary character (Amadis!) the model for his life :) ) Plato want the guardians of the state to be heroic, so they shall read literature that presents glory-seeking models to them. The heroes shall not fear death. I can't remember of the bat what he recommends for the common man. However, if you want to colonize a new world (and you are a bit of a machiavellian) you want to present traditional ideals to the working class people. The literature should value family life, hard work etc. You certainly don't want to give them heroic literature or avant-garde literature that challenges cultural norms. So it might be the Spanish authorities reasoned along these lines. They did not want the workers to start to seek glory and make a name for themselves. They wanted them to value the traditional things which would benefit the economic growth of the colonies and in this way expand the spanish empire.\",\n",
       " 'Greetings! This is an interesting question and it certainly touches on a rather popular \"myth\" if you will of \"America won the First World War\", the origins of which I must explore myself when time permits. But I digress. Let\\'s begin with an overview of the war situation in 1917, and then go from there to the American decision to enter the First World War. As a side-note, you mentioned the Zimmerman Telegram in your question, so this thread I assisted with regarding the impact of that telegram might be worth reading. The Crisis Year \"If the war goes on into 1919, the Americans will dictate to the world\" - Jan Christian Smuts, South African defense minister in the British Cabinet. 1917 marked a critical year of the First World War. It was the year of the Russian Revolution, the Passchendaele offensive, and the American entry to the war. On the homefront, the German populace was becoming (much like the citizens of all other nations in the conflict) weary of the war. The High Command under Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff were doubtful as to whether the war could even carry on into 1918, given the crippling Entente naval blockade and the general mood of the working class. The British and French, for their part, were also uncertain of whether their armies could continue the fight against the Central Powers. The British had suffered heavy losses in General Haig\\'s campaigns on Arras and Cambrai, and the French Army initiated a \"civil strike\" after the failure of General Nivelle\\'s Aisne offensive (Nivelle was then replaced by Petain, the hero of Verdun). To put it in the words of Michael Howard, the French and Russians were hors de combat (out of combat) for the better part of the year. In Russia, the revolutions of February (which forced Tsar Nicholas II to abdicate and 300 years of Romanov rule to end), and October (which saw the Bolsheviks seize control of the government) had crippled the already-weakened political unity of the Russians as an ally. The signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on March 3rd, 1918 removed them completely from the war, enabling the Germans to transfer the bulk of their troops to the western front. Amongst these major events and developments, the German High Command also relaunched their unrestricted submarine warfare campaign, which many historians view as the major instigating event in the American entry to the war. It was the sinking of multiple American vessels under this resumed campaign, alongside the Zimmerman Telegram, which finally pressured Woodrow Wilson to declare war on Germany on April 6, 1917. The End of it All The American entry to the war was a major relief to the Entente Powers, whose trade situation was also being strangled by the submarines of the Kaiserliche Marine. As John Milton Cooper Jr. puts it: \"The Allied financial position had deteriorated so badly that nothing could save them short of the rapid infusion of money that would require American co-belligerency as a pre-condition\". The entry of America into the war saved the Anglo-French treasuries from being strained to critical points, allowing both government to make more effective use of tight monetary control and rationing from then on. However, the American Army itself was an entirely different matter. When Congress declared war on Germany, the American army consisted of just 100,000 men, all of whom (save for the few volunteer fighters in Europe) were on the wrong side of the Atlantic. Until these troops, and in far greater numbers, could be shipped to France, the British and French would have to hold out for the time being. The \"low-point\" of the Allies in 1918 came in March, when the Germans launched their last-ditch Ludendorff Offensive, (otherwise known as the Kaiserschlacht, or Kaiser\\'s Battle). The British and French were cut off from each other, and the Germans pushed as far as the critical railway hub at Amiens, before the British held their ground and Ludendorff (whose supply/communication lines had been overstretched) called off the offensive. The Americans, who were now pouring into France at a rate of 250,000-300,000 a month, also posed a major threat to the German army. The Home Front Do not however, assume that this American manpower meant the end of the war. Ludendorff and Hindenburg were also losing control of the German populace to a dangerous extent. The Reichstag (German parliament) had already voted for a Peace Resolution on July 19th of 1918, and under that resolution control of the army was requested to be transferred to the hands of the civilian government rather than the monarchy. The Ludendorff offensive was the \"last card\" as Howard puts it, of the Germans. Conclusion On the whole, although America\\'s entry into the war did eventually (though not necessarily immediately in 1917) swing the balance of manpower and materiel in favour of the Entente, it was not guaranteed to be the \"final blow\" in the war as your question puts it. What it actually enabled for the Entente was, as I term it, the \"security of attrition.\" Imperial Germany came close to forcing the Allied governments to accept terms of peace, but America\\'s presence meant that Germany could not force the whole Entente to give up the fight. Michael Howard sums this up nicely without getting too counterfactual. \"Ludendorff\\'s object, not unlike that of Falkenhayn German commander at Verdun two years earlier, was not so much to destroy the Allied armies as to destroy the will of the Allied governments to persevere with the war and compel them to accept a compromise peace. He might have succeeded with the French. In another year it might even have been possible with the British. But it was out of the question with the United States.\" Hope this brief overview sheds a light on the matter, and if you would like to know more about the eventual German desire for peace in 1918, I highly recommend this lecture by Professor David Stevenson, who has written excellent books on the First World War.

       " \"The answer is likely no, although it is hard to prove a negative. In June 1940, the German Naval Staff (SKL) proposed basing U-boats in Dakar because of the concentration of shipping along the Atlantic coast of Africa bound from the Indian Ocean or South America to Britain (see page 12 of this book complied by the British in 1946 covering U-boat policy). So certainly the desire to use Dakar was there, and several Vichy submarines were based at Dakar, although they saw limited use. I am not able to find a single patrol that started or began at Dakar, including those of the U-105 and U-403, which were sunk very close to the port (using uboat.net as a resource, which has comprehensive data on this subject). This does not necessarily preclude Dakar as a refueling stop during a patrol, like the U-96's covert refueling in Vigo, Spain. However, I cannot find a single reference to a U-boat pulling into Dakar on uboatarchive.net Of course, this does not definitively rule out the possibility, as that website does not have every U-boat log digitized. But I also have not been able to find any reference to refueling at Dakar in any of my U-boat reference books. There are numerous references to U-boats patrolling in the vicinity of Dakar, but this appears to be due to the concentration of shipping of West Africa, as noted above. In terms of Djibouti and French Somaliland, I have been unable to find references. U-boats operating in the Indian Ocean were either based in France or in Penang, Malaya along with Japanese submarines (see Hitler's Gray Wolves by Lawrence Patterson). All U-boats operating in this theater were the larger Type IXC or IXD2 U-boats, which had longer range than the more common Type VIIC, and thus had no need for Djibouti as a base.\",\n",
       " 'The Soviets did thermonuclear research alongside their fission research, and assumed the Americans were as well (and they were right about that; the Truman \"crash order\" added a little urgency and priority, but the US was already working on H-bomb stuff since World War II). They benefitted from accurate espionage-derived intelligence on the state of US thermonuclear intelligence through around 1947, and were pursuing the same things, more or less, as a result. It was not a \"crash\" program, per se — it was just part of their normal research activities. They did not figure out how to make multi-megaton thermonuclear weapons until after the US had detonated one of their own, however. So one could make the argument that if the US had held off, and made it somehow clear that it was going to hold off, that the Soviets might not have been as rapid in their development. However given the lack of any way to verify if someone was researching thermonuclear weapons (other than a full-scale test) it seems unlikely that the Soviets would have taken any agreement very seriously (whether the US would have would have depended on how it was passed down). The Soviets, at least in their later years, generally regarded any verification-less treaties to be by their very nature likely to be violated on the US side, and so felt free violating them themselves. They regarded unilateral moratoriums (like the Test Ban Moratorium from 1958–1961) as being worth following only as long as it fit their interests (the US has held similar attitudes over the years). Is it possible that if the US had not raced into detonating a full-scale thermonuclear weapon that the Soviets would not have hit upon the way to do it? Often seeing that something is achievable is very stimulating to the imagination, and there are some allegations (denied by the Soviet scientists) that they were able to analyze the fallout from the US test to derive information about its design. So I guess you could imagine the whole thing being dragged out a bit longer if the US had pushed for such a thing. But I think it is very unlikely that the Soviets would have agreed to a \"true\" moratorium on the research. They would have needed to know if it was possible. Them being without thermonuclear weapons would be a significant disadvantage — more so than the US being without them. Why? Because the US had access to many forward bases and allies next to the Soviet Union. That meant that they could effectively attack the Soviets even without intercontinental ballistic missiles, with huge waves of bombers. The Soviets could not effectively do the same thing to the United States; it is too far away, and bombers are too vulnerable. This is why the Soviets invested, from quite early on, in ICBMs. And early ICBM accuracy is low-enough that anything less than a thermonuclear warhead is not an effective deterrent. (The US did not really begin investing in ICBMs until after it had thermonuclear weapons, for this very reason.) All of this is speculative, of course. I respect Priscilla quite a lot as a scholar and a person (she has had an amazing life — look her up!). There was an interesting article written by weapons designer Herbert York in the 1970s that essentially argued that _even if_ the US had not developed the H-bomb and the Soviets had not changed their history at all, that the US would not actually have been at any significant disadvantage and would have likely been able to \"catch up\" almost immediately. Which is to say, that the US had very little to lose from a moratorium attempt. So that is another position. (For this, see the discussion here But I think the view that the Soviets would have held off on H-bomb work both underestimates the Soviet view of things, and also underestimates how attractive the H-bomb would be for Soviet deterrence purposes. The US could effectively deter without the H-bomb; it is not clear the Soviets could.',\n",
       " 'A broad variety of shields was used, and while sometimes bigger was better, this wasn\\'t always the case - it isn\\'t just the size of the shield that matters, but also how well you can use it. We can divide shields by size, into huge, large, medium, and small shields. The largest shields in common use were pavises, mostly used by crossbowmen or other missile troops: https://manuscriptminiatures.com/3932/10781 http://blog-imgs-16.fc2.com/t/e/i/teitodennoumou/20071207163240.jpg https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ashigaru_using_shields_(tate).jpg although other infantry might use them too: https://manuscriptminiatures.com/4499/11797 Pavises were usually quite heavy, and were not held while fighting, but instead used as a portable wall for cover. The next step down in size was the large infantry shield, suited for fighting in formation, and often (but not always) used in shield walls: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Stele_of_Vultures_detail_01a.jpg https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Glanum-stele_legionnaires.jpg https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Protest_0030.JPG https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Heracles_Geryon_Louvre_F55.jpg https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Boudjas_-_Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_de_G%C3%A9ographie_.jpg https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PRIMITIVE_SOLDIER.jpg https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cernuschi_Museum_20060812_124.jpg Sometimes, these large shields were the only armour used, or the only armour other than a helmet. Large shields like these were often oval or rectangular. Otherwise, round shields were common, often about 75-90cm (30-36\") in diameter. The disadvantage of these shields was bulk and weight - they were large enough to be awkward to run with, and could be quite heavy. If infantry valued mobility more highly, smaller shields could be useful. Infantry who fought in open mobile formations, and skirmishers, often used smaller shields. Some examples of such medium-sized shields: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Alfred_Raquez-Groupe_de_guerriers_Khas-Kaseng_(Laos).jpg https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dinastia_han_anteriore,_guerriero_con_scudo,_cina_del_nord,_II_sec._ac..JPG https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bodyguard_(far_right)_detail,_from-_Sir_Ugyen_Wangchuck,_with_his_bodyguards,_Tongsa_Dzong_in_Bhutan,_1905_(cropped).jpg Smaller shields like this were also useful away from the battlefield, for duelling, for emergency self-defence, etc. The more extreme version for such tasks was the buckler, a very small shield which was easy to carry: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:38-svaghi,_lotta,_Taccuino_Sanitatis,_Casanatense_4182..jpg https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ms_I33_fol_24r.jpg The disadvantage of the buckler on the battlefield is that it is poor protection against incoming arrows compared to a larger shield. In a duel, it is light and quick, doesn\\'t tire the user, and doesn\\'t block the user\\'s vision or attacks. However, you asked about the classic knightly shield, which were medium-sized shields, but not usually used for the same purposes as the ones above. The classic knightly shield was a cavalry shield, and cavalry shields were typically medium-sized shields - 50-60cm (20-24\") round shields were common. Some cavalry used quite large shields, but these present a difficulty: they are not easy to move from one side of the horse to the other, and the enemy sometimes inconveniently attacks from the unshielded side. A smaller shield can be moved more easily to protect from more directions than a large shield. One notable example of cavalry preferring smaller shields was a reduction in the size of shields used by indigenous North American peoples from about 75-90cm to about 50-60cm when the horse came into use.

As for the specific shape, \"shield-shaped\" rather than round, this is possibly a functional development, to allow the shield to sit closely by the horse. It could also be primarily due to fashion, since round shields were more common in cavalry use, worldwide.

       " \"A brief preface here that as I'm working in historical context, I will mainly be using the past tense, but Manchus have not ceased existing or recognising clan and family structures, so bear in mind that much of what I say below can also be said in the present tense as well. 'Clan' in English is a somewhat clumsy way of translating the Manchu concepts of ᠮᡠᡴᡠᠨ mukūn and ᡥᠠᠯᠠ hala. Finding hard and fast definitions can be difficult, in no small part because there were changes over time in how the term was used. This is reflected, for instance, in Norman's Concise Manchu-English Dictionary: mukūn 1. clan, extended family, kindred 2. fleet 3. herd, flock. hala 1. clan, family, family name 2. kind, style, sort The situation is not helped by the existence of terms like mukūn hala and halamukūn, which seem to have been interchangeable terms effectively synonymous with just mukūn. In general terms, though, it is clear that in Manchu usage, a hala consisted of multiple mukun. In general terms, mukūn would be used to refer to a particular lineage and/or extended family, while hala would refer to all those sharing some kind of family name irrespective of actual relation. The basics of hala and mukun are laid out in Shirokogoroff's 1924 monograph Social Organisation of the Manchus: The Manchu clan hala is a group of persons united by the consciousness of their common origin from a male ancestor and through male ancestors, also united by the recognition of their blood relationship, having common clan spirits and recognising a series of taboos, the principal of which is the interdiction of marriage between members of a clan, i.e. exogamy. The number of hala was not particularly high, and with hala members spread geographically across the Qing empire, the 'clan' unit in any functional sense was the mukūn, which was typically associated with a lineage in a particular locale. Of course, the taboo against endogamy still applied, so two people from different mukūn under the same hala would still not be permitted to marry. However, mukūn rarely if ever actually referred to themselves by particular distinct names, and were instead somewhat of an amorphous common recognition. Shirogokoff also notes the existence of an intermediate division, ᡤᠠᡵᡤᠠᠨ gargan (literally, 'branches'), but argues that such arrangements seem to have been relatively informal and to have been subsumed when the mukūn came into being, and by 1924 only applied to the ᡤᡳᠣᡵᠣ Gioro hala, whose ᠠᡳᠰᡳᠨ Aisin ('golden') gargan made up the imperial family. Pamela Crossley, however, notes that mukūn are attested before hala in the older Manchu sources that had been uncovered since Shirogokoff's time, but as yet I am not aware of any more detailed modern study of the evolution of Manchu clan affiliations. Shirogokoff found 42 identifiable Manchu hala by 1924, some with as few as a single mukūn, but this reflects conditions in a late, post-imperial state of affairs. The official genealogies of Banner clans produced in the Yongzheng and Qianlong reigns include, according to Giovanni Stary, 642 of Manchu and other Tungus clans, 235 Mongol, 43 Korean, and 247 Chinese, the latter including subdivisions of 40 'Watchtower' and 50 'Fushun' Chinese clans. Mukūn of a hala would often, but not always, have a geographical association, and these are preserved in Stary's dictionary of Manchu names. So, for instance, we can talk of Adaha of ᡠᠯᠠ ᠪᠠ ᡳ ᡤᡡᠸᠠᠯᡤᡳᠶᠠ Ula ba-i Gūwalgiya (Gūwalgiya of Ula) and Adaha of ᠸᠠᡵᡴᠠ ᠪᠠ ᡳ ᡤᡡᠸᠠᠯᡤᡳᠶᠠ Warka ba-i Gūwalgiya (Gūwalgiya of Warka), two geographically distinguished mukūn of the same hala. It is important to add here that Manchu naming is often somewhat mistakenly handled in English-language materials by those unfamiliar with Manchu. While it is common to, for instance, refer to Qing emperors as, for instance Aisin Gioro Hung Li/Aixin Jueluo Hongli, Manchus did not use their hala and mukūn affiliations in their names. In proper Manchu, he would simply be Hung Li. It can be difficult to find good, up-to-date resources on the matter of how clan organisation and affiliation worked. The preface to Stary's Dictionary of Manchu Names is a good start, and has references to Shirogokoff's monograph and Crossley's 1991 book, The Manchus. Also useful (if you can get it) is Crossley's PhD thesis on the evolution of Manchu clans through the Qing period.\",\n",
       " \"I'm not sure the premise of this question is quite correct. You certainly can light alcoholic liquids below 40% - I managed to inadvertently flambé a stir fry recently by adding mirin, which is about 18% alcohol. However, it does very much depend on the temperature of the beverage - it's not the liquid that burns, but the alcoholic vapour. That vapour is only released in any meaningful quantity once the liquid is sufficiently hot (that is, reaches its 'flash point') - depending on the alcoholic content, that flash point for wine is between about 50 and 36 degrees centigrade. Assuming that Falernian was slightly on the strong side, it would have been entirely possible for it to reach that flash point if left outside on a hot Italian day, especially in a metal vessel. It's worth noting, though, that we're not talking about rigorous experimentation here - what Pliny is 'really' doing here is signalling to us how exceptional Falernian was, and we find that point emphasised in Roman sources from Petronius' novel, the Satyricon (where the boorish dinner-host makes outlandish claims that his wine is century-old Falernian) to graffiti in Pompeian taverns, which advertise Falernian at four times the rate of ordinary wine. Pliny's comment should be understood as an extension of Falernian's proverbial, exceptional quality. We shouldn't imagine that he (or anyone else) had actually gone and tested other wines, or indeed that he had anything other than tradition and hearsay behind his claim that Falernian was indeed flammable. In Book 7 of the Natural History, for instance, he talks about an elephant who was said to have learned to write in Greek - he's much more interested in collecting stories, anecdotes and facts than he is in interrogating or disproving them. We certainly shouldn't rush to re-evaluate our views of animal intelligence - or indeed wine - based on his testimony.\",\n",
       " 'Hi! As this question pertains to basic, underlying facts of the Holocaust, I hope you can appreciate that it can be a fraught subject to deal with. While we want people to get the answers they are looking for, we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of response. As such, this message is not intended to provide you with all of the answers, but simply to address some of the basic facts, as well as Holocaust Denial, and provide a short list of introductory reading. There is always more than can be said, but we hope this is a good starting point for you. ##What Was the Holocaust? The Holocaust refers the genocidal deaths of 5-6 million European Jews carried out systematically by Nazi Germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during World War II. Some historians will also include the deaths of the Roma, Communists, Mentally Disabled, and other groups targeted by Nazi policies, which brings the total number of deaths to 11-17 million. Debates about whether or not the Holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions, but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred. ##But This Guy Says Otherwise! Unfortunately, there is a small, but at times vocal, minority of persons who fall into the category of Holocaust Denial, attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude, impugn well proven facts, or even claim that the Holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened. Although they often self-style themselves as \"Revisionists\", they are not correctly described by the title. While revisionism is not inherently a dirty word, actual revision, to quote Michael Shermer, \"entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.\" It is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in 1950 or so, you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject, and that is the result of good revisionism. But these changes, which even can be quite large, such as the reassessment of deaths at Auschwitz from ~4 million to ~1 million, are done within the bounds of respected, academic study, and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars, and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections. There are still plenty of questions within Holocaust Studies that are debated by scholars, and there may still be more out there for us to discover, and revise, but when it comes to the basic facts, there is simply no valid argument against them. ##So What Are the Basics? Beginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership. First only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler’s approval. The early killings were carried out foremost by the Einsatzgruppen, paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the SS and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of Jews, Communists, and other \\'undesirable elements\\' in the wake of the German military\\'s advance. In what is often termed the \\'Holocaust by Bullet\\', the Einsatzgruppen, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too. By early 1942, the \"Final Solution\" to the so-called \"Jewish Question\" was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval. Construction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of \\'Operation Reinhard\\', had began operation by spring of 1942. Roughly 2 million persons, nearly all Jewish men, women, and children, were immediately gassed upon arrival at Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka over the next two years, when these \"Reinhard\" camps were closed and razed. More victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as Chełmno, but most infamously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where slightly over 1 million persons, mostly Jews, died. Under the plan set forth at Wannsee, exterminations were hardly limited to the Jews of Poland, but rather Jews from all over Europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter. Although the victims of the Reinhard Camps were originally buried, they would later be exhumed and cremated, and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as Auschwitz. ##The Camps There were two main types of camps run by Nazi Germany, which is sometimes a source of confusion. Concentration Camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the Nazis shortly after taking power, beginning with the construction of Dachau in 1933. Political opponents of all type, not just Jews, could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the pre-war years, and while conditions were often brutal and squalid, and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment, they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly. Although Concentration Camps were later made part of the \\'Final Solution\\', their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers. Some were \\'way stations\\', and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as \"extermination through labor\". Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and \"allowed\" to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end. Although some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps. The Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Bełżec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war. Several camps, however, were \\'Hybrids\\' of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was a vast complex of subcamps. The infamous \\'selection\\' of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies. ##How Do We Know? Running through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony. We have testimonies and writings from many who participated, as well German documentation of the programs. This site catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass extermination as it relates to Auschwitz. I\\'ll end this with a short list of excellent works that should help to introduce you to various aspects of Holocaust study. ##Further Reading \"Third Reich Trilogy by Richard Evans \"Hitler, the Germans, and the Final Solution by Ian Kershaw \"Auschwitz: A New History by Laurence Rees \"Ordinary Men by Christopher Browning \"Denying the Holocaust by Deborah E.

       " 'Japanese armour was, at least well into the 17th century, generally designed to be used in battle. Much of it was indeed colourful, something easily enabled by its lamellar construction. The individual plates in Japanese lamellar armour, whether made of iron/steel or rawhide, were usually lacquered to protect them from moisture, and a variety of colours could be used. Black was common, but bright colours were also common. The other main component of lameller armour (other than the plates themselves) was the lacing, perhaps rawhide thongs or silk cord, for which many colours could be used. Colours for lacing were often chosen to contrast with and complement the colour of the plates. Some iron lamellar armour in continental Asia was polished bright, rather than being lacquered, but this was a decorative effect in its own right. Japanese lamellar armour: http://digital.princeton.edu/mongol-invasions/index.php?a=scroll https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/26799 had much in common with continental lamellar armour, which could also be quite colourful: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:DiezAlbumsMountedArchers.jpg https://i.pinimg.com/564x/60/8a/af/608aaf6e795ecd7cdb8eba0f41dd8546.jpg https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ming_lamellar_coat_cavalry.jpg Japanese samurai armour is sometimes fancier than its continental counterpart, with elaborate helmet crests and face masks.

Noting the relative peace of the Edo Period, many late Edo armours were made almost purely for show, with no expectation that they would be worn in battle, because no battles were expected.',\n",
       " 'First I should acknowledge that food collection and consumption, like many other aspects of culture, varied in the Northwest Coast area by tribe and region. That said, to my knowledge there were no foods that were unique to potlatches. Rather, the foods that were distributed, ritually destroyed and consumed at potlatches were the same as those normally consumed, with perhaps more emphasis placed on foods that were rarer, acquired by trade, or more difficult to acquire in the season of that particular potlatch. Salmon either preserved by smoking or fresh was a mainstay but other fish such as halibut, cod, herring and processed eulachon oil or grease were also consumed. Many have observed that whitefish species were more important in the north and salmon species more commonly taken in the south where streams supported all five of the Pacific Salmon species. Eulachon grease was both used to season other foods, eaten alone and ritually destroyed by dumping it into fires \"so as to raise the flames to the sky\". Terrestrial and sea mammal meat was an important foodstuff. Ungulates were available in all of the PNW (Pacific Northwest). Deer and elk were more common in the south, whereas Moose and Mountain goats were more common in the north. Bears were also taken. Whales were hunted in the north (as far south as the Makah of Washington State), but beached whales provided meat and blubber farther south. Sea lions and seals were important throughout the PNW. Waterfowl and their eggs were also used. Vegetable foods included berries (blueberries, elderberries and wild strawberries), seaweed, root crops (e.g. camas). In the southern regions such as the southern Puget Sound and the Columbia River, acorns and pine nuts were staples. The inner bark of hemlock, shoots of salmonberries and some ferns, and cow parsnips were also commonly used. Finally, anyone who has spent any time around PNW archaeology would observe that virtually any and all shellfish species were collected and consumed. However, as shellfish were universally available and abundant, they were likely less important in potlatches.

The attack itself was already on the edge of Japanese logistical capability, to the point where early plans seriously considered the notion of abandoning whichever carriers didn't have enough fuel to make it back. Indeed, only three of the six carriers of Kido Butai had the unmodified capability to make it from Japan to Hawaii and back without refueling.

       " \"Greetings! This week seems to be filled with questions on Japan in World War II, and I'm not complaining! Alongside the excellent responses (tangential or linked) in u/DanKensington's comment and the crucially helpful aside by u/DBHT14, I would like to give a longer response based on a similar question I answered on the sub. Let's begin. Plan North or South? Adapted from an earlier response I made on the interwar politics of Japan worth a read if you are interested. In January of 1939, Prime Minister (and Prince) Fumimaro Konoe resigned his government position over the failure of the Japanese army to break the stalemate which had developed in China. He was followed by three men over the next eighteen months: right-wing bureaucrat Hiranuma Kiichiro, General Abe Nobuyuki, and Admiral Yonai Mitsumasa. All three had a clear problem on their hands: Japan was already bogged down in continental war with China, but the government (heavily influenced by the military) was well aware that further threats surrounding the island nation. To the north was the Soviet Union, a nation which Japan had sought to prevent from existing by dispatching troops to fight against the Reds in the Russian Civil War. To the south and across the Pacific were Britain and the United States respectively, each fielding powerful navies which threatened the IJN’s own fleets. There was no question that Japan’s warpath would eventually set it against all four of these threats. But as R.A.C Parker notes, the internal debate was on: “Timing and priorities; how far existing resources should be first developed, how far and to where they should be extended, which threats should first be countered and when.” Within this sphere of geopolitical debate, we have the emergence of two key ‘schools’. The first were the proponents of the Hokushin-ron (Northern Expansion Doctrine), which believed that the Soviet Union and its Siberian regions were the next prime target for Japan’s expansion. Prominent members of this group included PM Hiranuma himself, officers in the IJA, and war minister Seishiro Itagaki. Opposing them were the proponents of the Nanshin-ron (Southern Expansion Doctrine), which believed that the European colonies of British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies were the next prime targets for Japan’s expansion. Prominent members in this group included PM and former navy minister Yonai Mitsumasa, as well as admirals in the IJN.7 This army-navy dichotomy is actually a theme that has occurred before in Japan’s political discourse, so I shall quote Andrew Gordon here on the usual split between the IJN and IJA. “The army saw the greatest threat to Japan’s Asian hegemony—and the greatest opportunities to solve the problem—residing in China, especially North China and Manchuria. The navy focused its concerns on rival Western powers in the Pacific.” Both directions of expansion also had their problems, and it was these considerations alongside Japan’s reaction to external events which would ultimately sway the direction of the government. For Hokushin-ron, Japanese forces had lost the disastrous Nomonhan Incident, otherwise known as the “Battle of Khalkhin Gol” with the Soviet Union. This border skirmish took place in May of 1939, and it cost the Kwantung Army some 12,000 men dead or wounded. In addition to the German betrayal of Japan following the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, caused Tokyo to shift critically towards Nanshin-ron. Historian Owen Matthews on the significance of Nomonhan: “The humiliation of the Kwangtung Army strengthened the hand of the ‘South Strike’ Nanshin-ron Group - led by the navy - who argued for Japan to attack its Asian neighbors and leave the USSR alone. The Japanese reluctance to risk another trouncing at the hands of the Red Army would become a major factor in the outcome of the coming world war.” Mind you, Tokyo also knew that Nanshin-ron was not exactly a cakewalk through Southeast Asia. As Historian Owen Matthews writes, their main opposition was externally based: “Their the Imperial Navy’s two main obstacles were the British Royal Navy, operating a force far more powerful from Japan’s from the apparently impregnable base of Singapore, and the US Pacific Fleet out of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.” The debate then, rested on which threat to combat first, and when to best strike. For those decisions, the military planners in Tokyo watched and waited as the Second World War in Europe developed. A Chance to Strike? With the Fall of France and the seemingly inevitable Nazi invasion of Britain, the Japanese government gained its own concessions in Southeast Asia, notably by securing the precious resources and territory of French Indochina (by essentially forcing Vichy France to agree to practical rule of the colony). When Japanese forces formally moved into the area, America responded with a potential death blow: an oil embargo. 90% of Japan’s oil supply came from foreign imports, and 75% of that supply came from the United States. Roosevelt had issued a clear warning through this freeze. Gordon on the Japanese options: “It the Japanese government faced a difficult choice. It could agree to American conditions for lifting the embargo by retreating completely from China. Or it could follow the hawks and track the United States and British, taking control of the Southeast Asian oil fields by force and hopping to negotiate for a cease-fire from that strengthened position.” The military was also aware of just how lethal this embargo was. Here’s an extract from a report pursuing the case for war following the embargo: “oil is the weak point of our Empire’s national strength and fighting power… We are now gradually consuming oil that has been stockpiled…We will be self-sufficient for two years at most. This will be less if we carry out larger-scale military operations… our Empire will become powerless militarily.” Then on June 22nd, a fateful cable from Ambassador Oshima (stationed in Berlin) arrived at Imperial headquarters: the Third Reich had launched Operation Barbarossa, and now the Soviets were in a full-blown war against Hitler's regime. To the Japanese planners, this now added a new dimension and avenue for expansion. Should the Japanese honour their alliance with Germany and attack the Soviet Far East? Or should they bide their time and wait for further developments? Minister of Foreign Affairs Yosuke Matsuoka certainly thought the former was the best option (despite having signed a non-aggression pact with the Soviets two months earlier).15 So strong was his belief that Japan should attack north first, then south, that he personally requested an audience with Emperor Hirohito, and the decision makers in Tokyo met a few days later to review his proposal.\",\n",
       " 'Greetings! How fortuitous that I just finished an in-depth historiographical reading and essay on the Sino-Soviet Split! This major International Relations event of the Cold War is actually something that remains under debate in western and eastern academia, so you have touched on an interesting (and often overshadowed) topic of the Cold War indeed. Let\\'s see what light I can bring on the matter. Red Star Over China The origins of the Sino-Soviet Split can actually be traced as as far back as the Chinese Civil War\\'s end in 1949, when Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China (CPC or CCP) proclaimed the People\\'s Republic of China in Beijing on October 1st. Many historians have analysed the role of Mao as a crucial instigator in the split and the ideological persona of the Chinese Communists. By this time Mao had already formally adopted his own branch of Marxist-Leninist thought, known as Maoism. In Mao\\'s ideological splinter of Communism, it was the peasants in the countryside, and not the urban proletariat (or working class) who would spearhead the great socialist revolution. This contrasted sharply with Joseph Stalin and the CPSU\\'s belief that the urban proletariat and mass industrialisation were the keys to the socialist utopia. Though of course, ideological divergences at this time were of little consequence, as both countries were in vastly different economic states in 1949 (over 80% of China\\'s populace remained in the peasant farming class, whilst the USSR had a more urbanized workforce). Mao and the CPC personally viewed Stalin as the great hero of Bolshevism and the Communist movement worldwide, who had carried on with the fulfillment of the vision which Lenin had initially started in 1917. Here\\'s a fairly extract from an official document written by the CPC press (the Hongqi or Red Flag) titled \"On the Question of Stalin\". Stalin fought tsarism and propagated Marxism during Lenin’s lifetime; after he became a member of the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party headed by Lenin; he took part in the struggle to pave the way for the 1917 Revolution; after the October Revolution he fought to defend the fruits of the proletarian revolution. Stalin led the CPSU and the Soviet people, after Lenin’s death, in resolutely fighting both internal and external foes, and in safeguarding and consolidating the first socialist state in the world. Stalin led the CPSU and the Soviet people in upholding the line of socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization and in achieving great successes in socialist transformation and socialist construction. Stalin led the CPSU, the Soviet people, and the Soviet army in an arduous and bitter struggle to the great victory of the anti-fascist war. Stalin defended and developed Marxism-Leninism in the fight against various kinds of opportunism, against the enemies of Leninism, the Trotskyites, Zinovievites, Bukharinites, and other bourgeois agents. Stalin made an indelible contribution to the international communist movement in a number of theoretical writings which are immortal Marxist-Leninist works. Stalin led the Soviet Party and Government in pursuing a foreign policy which on the whole was in keeping with proletarian internationalism and in greatly assisting the revolutionary struggles of all peoples, including the Chinese people. Stalin stood in the forefront of the tide of history guiding the struggle, and was an irreconcilable enemy of the imperialists and all reactionaries. Stalin’s activities were intimately bound up with the struggles of the great CPSU and the great Soviet people and inseparable from the revolutionary struggles of the people of the whole world. Stalin’s life was that of a great Marxist-Leninist, a great proletarian revolutionary.^ A lengthy extract, but most indicative of the CPC\\'s positive view of Stalin. Now historians do also note that Mao and Stalin may have had some early mistrust amongst them. When they first met in Moscow in 1950, the resulting Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance solidified the positive (if, some may argue, superficial) relations between these giants of the Communist bloc. Among other things, the Treaty promised a loan of $300 million from the USSR to the PRC, which it used to kickstart the First Five Year Plan. One might assume that such a treaty would assure constant friendship between the two nations, but that was not to be the case. Early ripples were felt later that year... The Question of Korea In 1950, the Korean War broke out, and the Sino-Soviet Alliance was split on the extent of their aid to the DPRK. On the one hand, Mao and the CPC were eager to lend full armed support, going so far as to order 500,000 troops of the People\\'s Liberation Army to march across the Yalu River in October 1950 to assist the struggling North Korean Army. The USSR on the other hand, very reluctantly provided limited air support and economic materiel, despite Mao (and Kim Il Sung\\'s) constant requests to Stalin that he deploy the Red Army on the peninsula. Herein we find the seeds of a key point of divergence beyond the ideological one mentioned earlier: geopolitical strategy. Mao and the CCP were all for a concept often called \"Permanent Revolution\", in which the Communist states would have to actively fight against the imperialist-capitalist enemies in order to spread the revolution across the globe. Mao himself famously remarked that these powers were \"paper tigers\", and shared the following rhetoric: \"Only when imperialism is eliminated can peace prevail. The day will come when the paper tigers will be wiped out. But they won\\'t become extinct of their own accord, they need to be battered by the wind and the rain.\"^ The \"wind and rain\" in this instance, represented the force of the Communist bloc. Stalin and the CPSU however, did not share Mao\\'s openly confrontational view of the imperialist-capitalists. They preferred (and this was actually a key part of Stalinist thought), the opposite policy of \"Socialism in One Country\", which essentially is what it says on the tin. The spark which blew up a true fury of debate, and eventually led to the split however, came on the 24th of February, 1956. On The Cult of Personality and Its Consequences During the 20th Congress of the CPSU, Premier Nikita Khrushchev delivered his so-called \"Secret Speech\", denouncing the ideas of Stalin and commenting harshly on the Stalinist policies the USSR had come to adopt. With Khrushchev now in control, he led the Soviet Union away from these policies, towards his \"revisionist\" policies, including \"Peaceful Coexistence\" with the United States. This move absolutely angered Mao and the CPC, who were quick to publish works decrying the speech and speak out at International Communist Movement Meetings. In the sources is an excellent website which contains external links to translations of those speeches and works, it is highly recommend to read through a few of them. For the purpose of (attempted) concision, here is John Lewis Gaddis on the significance of the speech: \"he Mao argued that the USSR was losing its revolutionary edge, the true revolutionary country, China, would not make the same mistake.\"^ Further, the CPC viewed Khrushchev\\'s cooler view of the US as \"capitulationist\", and a complete betrayal of the Marxist-Leninist cause. Khrushchev for his part, \"opposed and feared Mao\\'s militant and unyielding Anti-Americanism.\"^ This infighting within the Communist bloc went back and forth over the ideological, geopolitical, and even military issues until it culminated in a 1969 border war between the USSR and PRC. The Bomb Another topic of divergence between the two powers was nuclear weaponry. The USSR had initially been eager to cooperate with the PRC, going so far as to send advisers throughout the late 1950s and provide prototypes of some atomic weapons. This response will not delve too far into those efforts, but they do make for an interesting side investigation. However, Khrushchev, in implementing his idea of Peaceful Coexistence, pursued arms negotiations with the western powers, and in 1960 withdrew all Soviet technical advisers and support for the Chinese nuclear program. Vladislav Zubok on this point: \"Khrushchev\\'s vision of nuclear bipolarity US and USSR possession became anathema something of hatred for Mao, because it relegated China to a secondary position in the pecking order of great powers.\"^',\n",
       " 'The reason you are confused is that scholarship has been confused on this topic for about a century. Woodhouse described hoplite combat as “in the main, a matter of brawn, of shock of the mass developed instantaneously as a steady thrust with the whole weight of the file behind it—a literal shoving of the enemy off the ground on which he stood.” This provided the image that would set the paradigm for hoplite combat for most of the remainder of the century and become known as the Orthodoxy, othismos as rugby scrum. A decade later Fraser would write “The Myth of the Phalanx-Scrimmage” with a healthy dose of scorn, something that would become a feature of debate that fell out in two camps of opinion. The debate would simmer until this day, couched in terms of a bellum sacrum between the Orthodoxy and Heretics like Fraser who sought to overturn the notion of literal pushing done in concert by all ranks of hoplites. These opposing views gathered detail and sucked in a wide range of other topics. If you want to know a scholar’s opinion on diverse topics such as the date when the hoplite phalanx tactics emerge, the amount of formal training or drill hoplites required, the weight of panoply, or the exceptionalism of Greek hoplites, you need only ask how they stand on othismos. For the Orthodoxy, championed by authors like Hanson, Luginbil, and Schwartz, hoplites spring into being by the date Tyrtaios wrote his elegies, or even the poetry of Homer, in a form familiar to Thucydides or Xenophon. Men marched on the field in heavily drilled and disciplined ranks of men with overlapping shields, then charged at the sound of a salpinx, or trumpet, in a simultaneous, running advance of the whole battle line when they came within a couple of hundred meters. They did not stop until they crashed directly into the line of their advancing foes like so many horseless lancers. After one good stab with their long thrusting spears, then crashed, shield on shield and began to push their foes as their own men collided with their backs, supporting their grinding advance. Men were encompassed in their bowl-shaped aspis shields. These has been designed specifically for this moment. When hoplites pushed in a “reverse tug-o-war”, they could shelter their entire upper body within the bowl of the shield and press their left shoulder into their foes with their bodies held perpendicular (as you would when pulling in a tug-o-war). There could be no question of spear fencing outside some possible blind thrusting from rear ranks caught within the masses. One side broke when the other had penetrated its line and caused them to lose their nerve. Then a general chase would ensue, but not to vehement because of the weight of panoply. Countering this view were an increasing number of authors by the 1980s. Cawkwell, Van Wees, Krentz, Goldsworthy, Holladay, and to some extend Snodgrass, built a competing paradigm over the next few decades. In their view, hoplite combat was a disorganized affair, a “motley crowd” of mixed armored spear men, light troops and cavalry. Men threw spears as often as stabbed with them, and the homogeneous, well trained, hoplite phalanx of the classical authors did not exist until after the Persian wars, if it existed at all. What would become the hoplite panoply developed slowly over the course of centuries, and Tyrtaios would have been more familiar with the tactics used in the tribal struggles of New Guinean warriors than his own descendants of the classical age. The reason for this schism is simple. Neither side knew what they were talking about. This is not denigration, in fact I applaud them, because they had to veer far outside of the academic training of historians to attempt to find a context upon which to build their paradigms. Reading through the literature you will find countless examples of authors claiming some element of the other side’s argument was physically impossible, or that it could only be done in the manner they describe. It is here that I entered the discussion. I am not a trained historian. My doctorate is in biology, specifically swarm behavior and the way large groups turn randomness into order. I am also a card carrying member of the American Physical Society, so I have a working knowledge of the mechanics and biophysics of humans in combat. I can bring one thing to the debate: context. For example, the Orthodoxy can see no way to have orderly masses of men on battlefields without extensive drilling and training of the men, while the Heretics assume that a heterogeneous mass of troop types must also lack order. But we know how order arises in chaotic groups. You have seen this every time you watch a flock of starlings or a school of fish. Masses of men can be coherent groups in the same fashion. Like the two camps, you can learn all of my opinions on hoplite combat by my stance on othismos. Othismos is a noun that derives from a verb meaning “to push”. The clearest way to make a noun from a verb is to describe it as “a state when that verb occurs”. Thus othismos is a state where pushing occurs”. This is a crowd, the type of crowd that leads to lethal disasters at sports events and concerts, where people get crushed. The “push” is not really against a foe, but within the crowd between men. Polybios 4.57 for example describes men in othismos as a crowd of routed men try to push through a gate and die in the crush. This is a two component system, a crowd at high density and a shared direction of movement that causes the crush. In the example above and in most crowd disasters the crowd is pushing against walls, but if two shield-walls of men meet in battle, they are the walls upon which the killing crowds form. That is othismos, a situation where men are fighting at high density and crowd on crowd pushing may ensue. It is not a tactic, but an emergent property of large masses of men crowded together with opposing movement directions. Cawkwell suggested that othismos could have happened late, after a period of fighting. In this he was correct, though he had some mistaken and confused notions about the men fighting in opened order. You gain no advantage by charging for “momentum”, because you can only push when you are packed tight and just 4 ranks of men can stop any number of ranks of men cold as they collide from a charge. Deep ranks are no advantage until the mass pack belly to back. Because of this, there is no reason that hoplites could not stop at the end of their charge and spear fence like any other ancient army would. No front ranker was launched into the spears of his foes. It would have been the front ranks who led the rear ranks into othismos, perhaps as spears broke and they went to the sword. Only at sword range, with your shield pressed to the enemy shield, could your rear rankers pack up close behind you. Why don’t you get crushed? These are the crowds that regularly kill people through compressional asphyxia. The answer is the aspis, the bowl-shaped hoplite shield. The shield can be held to rest with the upper rim on your collar bone and the front of your shoulder and on your thigh below, arching over and protecting your vulnerable diaphragm from compression. As a scientist, the only way to gain answers to how well this works is through experimentation. I conducted a series of experiments with hoplite reenactors and HEMA practitioners. Pushing in files of six ranks we generated 368 kg (3600N) of force. More importantly, we could sustain almost 200kg just by leaning forward into the other group. I will not list the authors who said this could not be done, but suffice to say it can. We also showed why 12 ranks of Spartans could hold off 50 ranks of Thebans. As you add more men to the files, you get less benefit from each new man. By the time you are over around 16 ranks, you are adding very little force, as the men in front absorb they input due to imperfect packing. So in my, let’s call it “Reconstructionist” scheme, men are free to enter battle throwing spears or fighting for an extended period of time, often one side would rout before the battle moved to a crowded state. But if it did become a matter of tight packed ranks, the posture that keeps your shield in place to protect your diaphragm from compression also allows your right arm to remain free to use your sword or spear. This was othismos. As Xenophon may have described it: fighting, pushing, dying.',\n",
       " \"The St. Paul Real School young Leyba Bronstein was attending in the years 1888-1896 has been built in 1825 as St. Paul Evangelical School, facing the street that was customarily called 'Lutheran Lane' after the nearby Lutheran Square. In 1858 it changed its name to 'German Real School', changing its profile to 'real', what at the time meant that its main education role was to prepare students for further economical and technical occupation or studies. In 1876 it has been reformed, with all the courses being taught in Russian (initially it was aimed at the needs of a local German community and the lessons were conducted in German, although since 1868 Russian was gradually introduced for some courses, suggesting that the school became popular among various inhabitants of Odessa) and the school itself being grated a status of a regular state school, although it remained independent and was supported by a local Lutheran community. Principals and inspectors of the school were being appointed by the local religious council and then approved by the Odessa branch of the Department of the National Enlightenment. In 1876 the school also changed its name to 'St. Paul's Odessa Real School'. In addition, it wasn't necessarily very prestigious, but rather simply known as a solid, modern educational establishment. It is worth noting however, that the school, although built and supported by the local German Lutheran community was open to everyone and did not discriminate along the national or religious lines during the admissions, paying only a lip service to the official guidelines. In 1890, when young Bronstein has already been attending the school for two years, the student roster included 139 Russians, 111 Germans, 83 Jews and 44 Poles. It also provided education to both boys and girls, although the classes were segregated and the school for girls had a curriculum preparing the students for the role of a housewife, as many other such schools of the time. The Pale of Settlement is not relevant here, as both the Poltava Governorate from where Trotsky's parents migrated, Janovka (now Byeryeslavka, Ukraine), where Trotsky spent the early years and Odessa, where is attended real school were located within the Kherson Governorate that was in the southern-central part of the Pale and Odessa, like many other port cities around Europe was generally known for its multi-ethnic population (before Second World War Russians and Soviets generally strongly associated this city with a large urban Jewish community, the sentiment is to some extent felt until today) and Trotsky was living in the house of his cousin, Moses Shpentser, who owned a small printing shop that later evolved into a large business. It should also be noted that although the region allowing the Jewish settlement was initially small, as the order of Catherine II of 23rd December 1791 speaks only of Mokhylev, Polotsk, Kiev and Chernigov governorate as well as the Novgorod and Yekaterinoslav Viceroyalty and Taurida Region, it was later expanded to all the Polish lands annexed during the Second and Third Partitions of Poland (from where majority of Russian Jews originated) only to be limited again, forcing majority of Jews to settle chiefly in the eastern part of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and southwestern Russia. But for almost a century, the settlement restrictions were not observed very strictly, as the major expulsion of the Jewish inhabitants of St. Petersburg and Moscow was noted as late as 1891 (although some of the specialists deemed 'useful' were allowed to stay). Of note is that the restrictions were generally preventing Jews from settling in villages and since the introduction of the 'Provisional Regulations Regarding Jews' on 15th May 1882, also in smaller towns (under 1000 inhabitants), limiting the settlement to large towns, cities and rural colonies. Regulations also prevented Jews from renting or getting a management title to any real estate outside such settlements. Jews were never banned from attending any kind of schools, including universities, but in 1880s new 'numerus clausus' regulations limited their number in any given high school or university to the overall percentage of Jews in the entire Empire, regardless of the actual percentage in a given region or city. These restrictions were later increased to 10% in the Pale of Settlement, 5% outside it and 3% in St. Petersburg and Moscow. Thus, although the access to education was limited for Jews, it was still possible. In his autobiography, Trotsky states, that after narrowly passing an exam, he was assigned to an introductory class, as the promotion to the actual school from within was not a subject to the restrictions that, as the practice has shown, was not really observed by the school authorities. Thus, the attendance of a Jewish boy in a school in a large city within Pale of Settlement in 1880s was nothing really exceptional. Lev's father bought Janovka from the family of the retired Colonel Janovski (possibly of Polish origin) who was awarded 500 dyesatinas of land (roughly 550 ha or 1370 acres) but did not manage to turn it into a prospering homestead before his death. Bronsteins bought initially 100 ha and later rented 200 ha more, eventually becoming a major landholders, at least for commoners in the mid-19th century Russian Empire, where the serfdom has been abolished shortly before. In addition, they also rented 200 ha some land from the Dembowski family that lived nearby and 400 ha from Hertopanovskoy family. Trotsky himself considered his family very affluent and judging from the given numbers and described realities, this most likely was the case. The fact that Bronsteins were Jews did not seem too important, the fact that they were largely not observed any Jewish customs, used Russian Ukrainian language and were not subscribing to any religion suggesting that other people might have simply taken them for Ukrainians. In Kherson and Yekaterinoslav Governorates there were roughly 40 Jewish rural colonies inhabited by circa 25.000 people, who were generally treated as all other agricultural workers, regardless of origin. According to Trotsky, his parents were able to get ahead largely thanks to their hard work and skills, what was maybe not very common, but definitely not unheard of. So, Bronstein family was definitely not an average Jewish family at least for standards of Russian Empire, but it largely started with everyone else and had both luck and skill that allowed them to flourish. Young Trotsky attending grammar school in Odessa was also something normal, especially given that it was a more or less a private establishment loosely implementing governmental restrictions.\",\n",
       " \"Margaret Mitchell's Gone With The Wind would appear to be a good source to address how White Southern culture retconned the book's subject once Civil War veterans' grandchildren were in charge of popular culture. It also sheds light on OP's question. It goes without saying, though I am saying it anyway, please do not look to this book for actual history. After a few swings and misses, I finally read it all the way through 5ish years ago. Not a surprise - the word shows up a lot. Somewhat surprising - Scarlet and maybe Melanie Wilkes(?) - 2 patrician women characters - object to the use of that term. It was considered vulgar, maybe akin to the word 'shit' or 'fuck.' It is not an evil thing, but it is a breach of good manners and decorum to use such a word in the 1860's, says the author in a book published in 1936. OTOH, the narrator's voice uses it occasionally as an adjective or to refer to the rougher elements of the Black community. Bonus - the book is as racist as it seems, but the author also supported Morehouse College modestly + anonomously at first, but much more later on, and paid for the education of dozens of Black doctors/dentists After her untimely death, her estate, at her instruction, and some descendants ran with the ball, so history is complicated.\",\n",
       " \"That is a fascinating topic to discuss that of course could never be answered definitively.

If I had to sum up their view, it would be that while the South was a large underdog by almost any metric, the task before the North, politically, militarily, economically, and culturally, was enormous and its result was not a foregone conclusion. As for the North's advantages: It's economy was several times larger than the South's, as was its population. Not only was its economy much larger, it was more diverse. With well known advantages in technology and manufacturing, but also the Midwest was starting to boom as a producer of agricultural goods which helped to make up for the loss of the South's agricultural production during the war. The South's economy of course was very much dependent on cotton exports, which were not possible due to the Union blockade, and was much less built up in manufacturing in an era that arguably was the dawn of industrialized warfare. This gets to another advantage of the Union which doesn't get enough attention, its overwhelming naval might. The South fought for most of the war under a blockade that stretched from the coast of Virginia to Texas, and from New Orleans to eventually the length of the entire Mississippi. The South had zero ability to materially impact the Union navy and the result was devastating on their chances. The North's naval control of the seas and the waterways gave it a huge logistical advantage over the South. And yet while the North had enormous advantages over the South, they also had a much harder job. The South essentially needed to maintain the status quo after secession, the North needed to conquer an enormous and in many areas wild country full of people who were dedicated to fighting them. Murray and Hsieh make the interesting point that the distance from New Orleans to Richmond was roughly the same distance from Berlin to Moscow. The area the North had to conquer, hold, and pacify was of continental proportions and was a massive task for an army that just a few years before was not much more than a glorified garrison force. Murray and Hsieh then stumble into the great man debate of history, in giving Lincoln and Grant enormous credit for the North winning the Civil War. Personally I think they make a good case. I think if the North's president had been a mediocrity, or there was no General Grant, that it's possible that the South could have held out for a peace deal and recognition of its independence. That being said, that's the only way I could see it happening. More through Union incompetence than by anything the South could have done differently. Edit: Wow, thanks for the awards!\",\n",
       " 'In addition to u/MaterialCarrot\\'s excellent answer, I would also call your attention to the possible effects that slavery had on the war\\'s outcome. Depending on your perspective, the institution of slavery was either an enormous boon to the Confederacy which allowed it to stand a much stronger chance against the Union, or it was a millstone around the Confederacy\\'s neck which guaranteed its defeat. I tend toward the latter opinion. On the plus side, slavery freed a large percentage of the Southern population from farm and manual labor. In the South, enslaved people performed much of the manual labor which would have been done by free men in the Union. Thus, the Confederacy could mobilize a significantly higher percentage of its population into military service than the Union. Although the total population of military-age white males in the Confederacy was less than 1/3 that of the Union, the Confederacy could put almost its entire male population into military service. This meant that the Union never had an overwhelming advantage in manpower, despite its much larger population. On the negative side, slavery meant that the Confederacy was home to--and dependent on--a large population of people who were held under subjugation and actively hostile to the Confederate cause. This was a massive weakness which the Union exploited throughout the war in various ways. At the beginning of the Civil War, any enslaved person who escaped behind Union lines was classified as \"contraband of war\" and not returned. Later, this policy was formalized by the Emancipation Proclamation, which was meant more as a war measure to deprive the Confederacy of a valuable resource rather than as a humanitarian measure to free people. Every former slave who ran away and crossed to Union lines was one less pair of hands to harvest the crops or sew the blankets or dig the trenches which the Confederate Army needed. Interestingly, it has been argued recently by Robert L O\\'Connell that enslaved people played an underappreciated role in the Union\\'s victory by acting as informal guides, scouts, spies, and informants for the Union Army. Particularly, O\\'Connell zeroes in on Sherman\\'s successful campaign through Georgia and the Carolinas, which broke the back of the Confederacy and probably did more to win the war than any other land action. Sherman\\'s army marched more than 500 miles through hostile territory without food or good maps. At the time, Sherman\\'s campaign was thought to be suicidal. However, it was a complete success, largely because Sherman constantly received information from enslaved people who despised the Confederates and wanted to see the Union win. If not for their assistance, it is probable that Shermans\\' March could have ended very differently.',\n",
       " 'The US Civil War was never about outright victory for either side to be perfectly honest, although the North certainly could have. The problem with Civil Wars in general is the winning side will have a lot more work to do if it obliterates the loser. Since you know, future of the country and all that. The North and Lincoln\\'s objective was to stop the insurrection. They won because of a few serious losses by the Confederacy coupled with a bit of starving them out. On the other hand, what if Johnston and Stonewall don\\'t die because of friendly fire or perhaps even more of an alternate if Stonewall is allowed to pursuit after Bull Run onto Washington is such an early period of the war before Lincoln\\'s call for half a million troops? It gets very political. Other considerations would be if Kentucky & Missouri join the Confederacy in more than half or at least serve as more supply and buffer benefits. I think it\\'s because of these nuances many from the South may believe the Confederacy definitely had a chance. I haven\\'t even discussed European involvement which frankly put if the war extends by even a year may have come to pass or just if things are in more of a stalemate prior to the 64 election. Imagine a bunch more Cold Harbors in the best case scenario. Now McClellan lost by a wife margin in the electoral college to Lincoln but New York was by less than 1% and several others were within 5%. If the Confederacy does quite a bit better including Gettysburg it\\'s entirely possible he loses that election. Historically he was the first President since Andrew Johnson three decades prior to win re-election. So then we discuss how a Confederacy \"win\" looks like. It\\'s basically status quo with slavery obviously but the Confederate States rejoin the Union as well if not at the end of the war then later. I just don\\'t see the same outcome is all I\\'m saying. Definitely no reconstruction, but the economy of the Confederacy is an interesting variable. Their money wasn\\'t backed by anything tangible so suffice to say economically there would be a lot of interest in rejoining the North in one way or another.',\n",

       " 'I There are going to be substantial differences between various national literatures, though we can try and find some common ground. Roughly, up to, and perhaps during early eighteenth century, the trend of Alpine aesthetics shifted thoroughly. Prima facie, this account has some grounds to stand on, though to take it univocally would be equally mistaken, as the literature even in early modern period accounts for a much more multivariate accounts. Though to precisely characterize the shift in eighteenth century diaries, letters, and literature, and contrasting this to demographical data, would certainly yield interesting results, though I am not aware of any such study being done. So the passage in question from Gadamer, The relevance of the beautiful Art as play, symbol, and festival. We remember, for example, how the Alps were still described in travel diaries of the eighteenth century as terrifying mountains whose ugly and fearful wildness was experienced as a denial of beauty, humanity, and the familiar security of human existence. Today, on the other hand, everyone is convinced that our great mountain ranges represent not only the sublimity, but also the exemplary beauty of nature. Importantly, Gadamer is in the essay writing in German aesthetical tradition, and not doing historical and anthropological work as such. So, this will be a very rough generalization: - In the Middle Ages, what we get of positive accounts of \"uncivilized\" spheres and nature are when these are used as a safe place for lovers, someone pursued by injustice, pilgrimage ( though the attitude here is much more ambivalent, and should be definitely taken differently ), where this aspect of unreachability, lawlessness serves a protection against unjust law, in a place that usually reeks of hostility. Alpine typology was often seen as almost infernal, like in Miltonic description in Paradise Lost: Through many a dark and dreary dale They pass\\'d, and many a region dolorous O\\'er many a frozen, many a fiery alp; Rocks, caves, lakes, fens, bogs, dens, and shades of death. And Milton was no exception in this, another prominent English dramatist John Dennis wrote thusly, But if these mountains were not a Creation, but form´ed by universal Destruction, when the Arch with a mighty flaw dissolv´d and fell into the vast Abyss then are these the Ruins of the old World ... For they are not only vast, but horrid, hideous, ghastly Ruins,... This kind of symbolical eschatology was specially popular in Anglican millenialism, which found articulation in Burnet´s The Sacred Theory of the Earth; There is nothing doth more awaken our thoughts or excite our minds to enquire into the caufes of fuch things, than the actual view of them, as I have had experience my felf when it was my fortune to crofs the Alps and Appennim Mountains, for the fight of thofe wild, vaft and indigefted heaps of Stones and Earth, did fo deeply ftrike my fancy, that I was not eafie till I could give my felf feme tolerable account how that confufion came in Nature. .. But fuppofe a man was carrfd aileep out of a Plain Country amongft the Alps, and left there upon the top of one of the higheft Mountains, when he wak’d and look’d about him, he would think him- felf in an inchanted Country, or earn\\'d into another World, every thing would appear to him fo diiferent to what he had ever feen or imagin’d before. To fee on every hand of him a multitude of vaft bodies thrown together in confufton, as thofe Mountains are; Rocks ftanding. naked round about him, and the hollow Valleys gaping under him, and at his feet it may be, an heap of frozen Snow in the midft of Summer. He would hear the thunder come from below, and fee the black Clouds hanging beneath him, Up on fuch a profpeft, it would not be eaiie to him to perfwade himfelf that he was ftill upon the fame Earth ·, but if he did, he would be convinc’d, at leaft, that there are fome Regions of it ftrangely rude, and ruine-like, and very different from what he had ever thought of before.

But eighteenth century \"positive turn\" had some worth precursors, like famously Rhellicanus Stockhornias, Gessner Epistola de Montium admiratione, due to their presence in influential Grant-Carteret´s study from 1904, La Montagne a travers les ages.

Lettres de deux amans, habitans d’une petite ville au pied des Alpes from Rousseau, The Alp from Keate, influential works from Coleridge and Shelley, and oodles of others, with the rise of nature in romanticism and aesthetics of sublimity.',\n",
       " 'Certainly there were some. There was a well-known novel by Yulian Semyonov called \"17 Moments of Spring\", about a Soviet spy - that is, an intelligence operative - in Berlin during WW2. The movie series based on the novels, also called \"17 Moments of Spring\", was popular to the point that the streets were noticeably empty when it was on television, and both the series and the various characters from it remain iconic in Russian culture to this day. Stierlitz, the spy hero of the series, is the person who everyone would name as the Soviet equivalent of James Bond, in the sense that he was a superspy. But he is not really a similar character. There were several other movies and novels with intelligence and spying themes, e.g. \"The Shield and the Sword\" and \"In the August of 44\", almost always in a WW2 setting. \"In the August of 44\" had many consultants from the security services and is supposed to be an accurate representation of counterintelligence work. If you mean specifically Cold War spying and intrigue, then the same Semyonov also wrote \"TASS Is Authorized to Declare...\", which was also turned into a film series. It was well-known at the time, but did not leave as deep a cultural imprint as \"17 Moments\". But in general, the USSR had very few films or novels even set in the contemporary Western world, and very few fictional treatments of Cold War confrontations. One exception is the movie \"The Detached Mission\" or \"Solo Voyage\", which had American bad guys, and which I remember hearing at the time being called \"retaliation\" for various American movies with Soviet villains. However, there were too few American characters of any sort in Soviet literature or film to make much of an impact, and the USSR \"retaliated\" very little in this way, despite complaining bitterly about their own representation in Western movies - I recall a lot of noise about one of the Rocky movies in which a Soviet boxer kills an American in the ring.',\n",

       " \"We have quite a bit of archeology on this subject. The answer is yes, there is evidence that there were long distant contacts between Pre-Columbian civilizations, but characterizing them is very difficult. Many culture zones in the Americas have this tendency to appear as distinct entities (Mesoamerica, the Andes, the Plains, the American Southwest) and while we struggle to find clear evidence of their relations with one another across time, we are certain that contacts did exist and could be quite distant. The one I can speak to with some basis of knowledge is the west coast of Mexico (I'm just gonna borrow a graphic from Wikipedia because this answer might otherwise be confusing and the picture is readily available This region, marked West on the map, is home to a number of things we'd more closely associate with South America than Central Mexico. Within this region, one of the oldest cultures (it has no name) were Shaft Tomb builders that have striking similarities to the Andes civilizations of South America. The people who lived here built shaft tombs of striking similarity to those of Peru, and that are distinct from their Olmec, Maya, and Zapotec neighbors. This is in the pre-Classic, 2000 BC to 250 CE. Unfortunately many of these tombs were raided long before Archeologists got to them. Fortunately, there is enough left behind that we can draw clear lines to South America. Found in this region and time are a peculiar form of knife and a pottery form we see Andean civilizations; the Tumi Knife and the stirrup vessel. The Tumi is a broad knife that kind of looks like a spade. It was used in ritual decapitation, a form of human sacrifice we generally associate with South America, not Central America. Stirrup vessels look kind of like a tea pot with the spout at the top of the handle. They're a rather distinct form of pottery and their presence in West Mexico is notable because no one else in Mesoamerica was making pottery like that. These things are all unique to West Mexico in central America. The only other place in the world you'd find all three (shaft tombs of that type, Tumi knifes, and stirrup vessels) is in the Andes of South America. There is clear evidence of cultural exchange in this region between Mesoamerica and the Andes. These thing are all too specific to be coincidental. It's also notable that metal working first appears in Central America in West Mexico in the 9th century. The Teuchitlan culture, which began in the late Pre-Classic and continued into the Classic (250-900), build rounded pyramid mounds. So did the latter Tarascan civilization, contemporaries of the Aztecs. These cultures built temple complexes that are more South American than central American. They had a round temple mound at the center and rings of rectangular mounds around them. Circular forms are very rare in Mesoamerica, especially in the classic. They aren't rare in South America and there are similar ceremonial complexes there. It's worth noting though that we do find distinctly Mesoamerican themes here as well. Ball courts are common. We see art depicting the Voladores tradition that is distinctly Mexican, usually more associated with the Gulf coast's Classic Veracuz culture. But the art depicting it in West Mexico is from the pre-classic, long before the earliest evidence shows up in cities like El Tajin on the Gulf Coast. If the art is taken at face value as a precursor to the Voladores of latter civilizations, it would suggest West Mexico was connected to both South America and Mesoamerica in a lasting way. There's a lot we don't know about the West coast. it's gotten less attention than other parts of Mexico and grave robbers have spoiled a lot of what we do know about. We do however have reason to suspect the west coast, and thus South America, may have had further contact. Another site to consider is Casas Grandes, also called Paquime. Casas Grandes is a weird place. We find structures, pottery, and art, there that can be associated with the American Southwest, Mesoamerica, and earthen mounds that would be more typical of the Mississippi mound builders than anywhere else. Casas Grandes is a giant question mark. We don't agree on who built it or ruled it or what role it played in the pre-Columbian world. I don't want to wade too far into it because there's a mountain of debate about how to place the site in archeology but it's worth noting because of it's mish-mash nature. So yes. We know these cultures had contact, but characterizing it is very difficult. Not everyone had a written language like the Maya, or they didn't have one that survives or that we understand. We also have a very confusing archeological record, one that occasionally gives us objects or materials that are out of place, but distant trade goods in large numbers are rare. We have enough evidence to know there was contact, and thus someone had to explore at some point, but understanding it continues to elude concrete explanations. I'm going to shill my favorite resource for Mesoamerica, Maya to Aztec: Ancient Mesoamerica Revealed, by Edwin Barnhart. It's a lecture series from the Great Courses and you can find it Audible. You can also find companion courses on South America and North America which aren't as good, but are also from Barnhart and can as a trio form a wonderful introduction to Pre-Columbian American history and archeology.\",\n",
       " 'I wrote this without seeing u/Lord0fHats\\' post, and don\\'t mean to detract from what he wrote. Also, I edited for links. Like many of my answers about the Pre-Columbian Americas, I have to preface this answer with the fact that an astonishing amount of information about its peoples and places was lost in the intentional and unintentional actions of European colonization. There\\'s evidence for long-distance travel amongst many different historical Amerindian communities, in various contexts. Peoples in the Southwestern United States were breeding scarlet macaws somehow brought from their distant native range in Central America^, the Inca sent armies 3,000 km from their capital to the Maule River in Chile^, and the Mayan economy made use of long-distance sea trade^. These events and more suggest that Amerindian peoples were involved in an activity which seems pretty common to humanity: figuring out the world around us, by traveling to other places and interacting with new people. The conscious and political possibilities of these actions are clear in examples such as that of the Aztec pochteca class. This important traveling trader social group played a role in politics and military activities. The pochteca even had a naualoztomeca subgroup; \"\\'disguised traders\\' who were multilingual and acted as spies\" (Tucker and Janick 2019: 15)^. As far as I know, the Aztec pochteca class and a few other similar groups - mostly in Mesoamerica - are some of the most specific examples we have of people who might be called \"explorers.\" However, I\\'d like to write about one other, extremely tentative case. This next section is by no means proven, and I don\\'t think I even have a certain position on all of the many different aspects of its validity. If this strays too much into unproven territory for the moderators of this sub, I\\'ll understand. But I think that the topic is at least relevant to the question, and worthy of discussion. If a more knowledgeable historian knows that I\\'m operating from poor sources and information, please clear up my mistake in a comment or message to me. Tupac (or Topa) Inca Yupanqui was the tenth Sapa Inca (Emperor) of the Inca Empire. He lived from 1441 to 1493, and ruled from 1471 to his death. Tupac was an accomplished ruler and well-traveled man. He played roles in conquering areas of modern-day Ecuador and Chile, although other contributors to those conquests have probably been overlooked in favor of official Inca accounts that favored the Emperor.^ An account by the Spanish historian Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa claims that Tupac Inca Yupanqui made an extensive voyage into the Pacific Ocean. Here are some excerpts: \"Marching and conquering on the coast of Manta, and the island of Puna, and Tumbez, there arrived at Tumbez some merchants who had come by sea from the west, navigating in balsas with sails.\" \"They gave information of the land whence they came, which consisted of some islands called Avachumbi and Ninachumbi.\" \"The Inca, having this certainty, determined to go there. He caused an immense number of balsas to be constructed, in which he embarked more than 20,000 chosen men.\" \"he returned to Cusco after an absence of six years since he set out on this campaign\" \"Tupac Inca Yupanqui entered Cuzco with the greatest, the richest, and the most solemny triumph with which any Inca had ever reached the House of the Sun, bringing with him people of many different races, strange animals, innumerable quantities of riches.\" de Gamboa\\'s account suggests that Tupac Inca Yupanqui sailed into the Pacific Ocean after meeting sailors who arrived on the South American coast. There is no certain evidence of its truth. However, it must be considered in the context of likely Polynesian contact with Western South America before Europeans reached the Americas. Although uncertain, the reality of Polynesian-Andean contact pre-1492 is at least worth discussion: potential evidence comes in the form of linguistics^ , animals^(7,8), possibly genetics^, and more. So it\\'s not totally impossible that Tupac Inca Yupanqui encountered Polynesian sailors and then explored islands in the Pacific. Potential evidence for this also exists in the presence of the totora reed on Easter Island; a plant which is otherwise only found in the Andes^, and is used in indigenous shipbuilding practices. Other, even more tenuous lines of potential connection that are claimed by some include Inca-style stonemasonry at the Easter Island site of Ahu Vinapu amongst even more speculative ideas. I\\'d like to say again that, if the mods of this site think my last section was reaching into unknown territory too much, I understand if this post is removed. However, Gamboa\\'s document is a historical one, and it should be considered in the context of wider potentials of Polynesian-Andean contact. If Gamboa\\'s report reflects reality, then Topac Inca Yupanqui is perhaps the only Pre-Columbian Amerindian explorer that we can put name to. &#x200B; ^ George, R. J. et al. .

       " 'I am going to start this the way I have started all my answers on Helotage: we don\\'t know, and we never will know. However, we can make guesses as to how things best worked on the ground. It was long held to be true that the Helots supplied half of all their produce to their Spartiate masters following their enslavement after the Messenian War. This view is built upon Tyrtaios fragment 6 (West); like donkeys suffering under heavy loads, by painful force compelled to bring their masters half of all the produce that the soil brought forth. This does seem, at first glance, to be a definitive answer to your question. However, this quote says nothing about the Helots, let alone the Messenians (West actually introduces this passage with \"The enslaved Messenians were...\"). This quote does seem to indicate the Messenians if you are looking for them, for fragment 5 (West) does mention the conquest of the Messenians by the Spartans (the fragment numbers are arbitrary, and do not indicate any actual sequence of composition), and fragment 7 (West) references people having to attend the funerals of their masters. Yet, despite the modern association of these fragments with Helotage, none of our sources, sources that do utilise Tyrtaios as evidence for other claims, do not use these fragments when discussing Helotage. Modern consensus now believes that these fragments indicate a form of debt-slavery, similar to the situation in seventh century Athens, and potentially the case throughout Archaic Greece, and that Helotage evolved out of this system. Furthermore, it is believed that slavery in Archaic Greece may have resembled Helotage more than other forms of Classical Greek slavery, that is, slaves with relatively loose obligations to their masters, other than to provide produce (see van Wees, 2003). However, this doesn\\'t tell us much about how things worked on the ground in Classical Lakedaimon (the territory controlled by Sparta, encompassing both Lakonia and Messenia). It is important to remember that Spartiates had obligations to remain in Sparta itself, and their landholdings were likely spread across the regions of Lakonia and Messenia, straddling the Taygetos mountains. Taken together, this means that Spartiates would have been able to assert closer control over their Lakonian holdings than their Messenian ones, given the geographical barriers between Sparta and Messenia, which would have made any journey to Messenia a significant one. This means that there was unlikely to have been any single method of extracting tithes from the Helot farmers, and instead several strategies were likely to have been used. There are a number of conditions of Helotage that our understanding allows us to factor in when attempting to reconstruct how it worked, and the most significant one is that the Helots were a monoglot and self-reproducing population. You mention Helot families, and while it is safe to assume that there was some form of familial groupings among the Helot population, we actually have no definitive answer as to how significant these were. Tyrtaios fragment 7 has been taken to indicate the presence of Helot families, but as we have already discussed, there is no need to necessarily take Tyrtaios\\' word as meaning Helots. Furthermore, Tyrtaios fragment 7 closely resembles Herodotus\\' discussion of the Spartan kingly funerals (6.58), so it does not necessarily point to Helot families. The only express mention of families among Helots is in Thucydides (1.103), but again this does not indicate the Helot families were officially recognised by the Spartans. As the Spartans did not likely involve themselves in the Mediterranean slave trade (the perioikoi may have done), they relied on the Helots to self-reproduce. This means that the Spartans had an incentive to allow the Helots enough to keep a significant proportion so as to support their propagation. However, produce would have taken precedence over Helot propagation, and if Helot families grew too large for the plots of land they worked to support, then families may have been separated and moved between plots, particularly if they were not officially recognised by Spartans. Although this is unlikely to have happened too often, for keeping families in the same plots means that knowledge of the land develops over generations, and this intimate knowledge would enable the Helots to exploit the land to the fullest potential. With Spartan absenteeism and the desire for more Helots in mind, Hodkinson has compared Helotage to other forms of serf-slave systems, and he came to the conclusion that sharecropping was the most likely system of produce extraction, with each plot having its own agreement between the Helots farming it and the Spartiate owner. These agreements regarding Messenian plots of land were likely much looser and less strictly enforced, given the geographical distance and barriers, than those of the Lakonian plots. While the proximity of Spartiate masters to their Lakonian plots meant that they likely had more intimate knowledge of the workings of the Lakonian plots, so they could alter their sharecropping agreements in response to any developments, whether good or bad. The Spartan absenteeism and lack of imposing authority in Messenia may have contributed to the revolt of the early 5th century. I hope this has answered your question. Please feel free to ask any more. &#x200B; Bibliography: S.

You\\'ll see there that it all depends on which definition of Capitalism you are using (Marxian, Schumpeterian, or something else entirely). If Capitalism is the mere existence of private enterprise, then we have to look no further than the collapse of the Mycenaean \"Palace Economy\" and trace the seafaring routes of ancient merchants as early as the Bronze and Iron ages. If we are instead discussing a political and social system constructed by and for owners of capital (with that capital, in turn, operated by a wage-laborers) the system probably first emerged in Mediterranean Europe sometime in the 12th or 13th centuries (principally Italy — Incidentally my own area of interest). When all\\'s been said and done, I would pose a conceptual question: why is there a need for \"a safe consensus-driven answer\" to exist? Any Social Science theory will naturally be constrained by whatever definitions you are applying, and what underlying assumptions you are starting from. There is always room for more discussion and interpretations, and the very underlying assumptions of what defines Social Science labels is no exception.',\n",

       " 'The question of resources was a major underlying factor in what drove Japan\\'s aggressive stance and action in the Pacific and East Asia. While oil is usually touted as the foremost resource in question, issues such as steel production were as important, if not more so, than oil. I am not going to comment on Germany, as that is well outside my area of expertise. However, in Japan\\'s case, its expansion and desire for empire was not solely about oil, but rather, oil was a small portion of a much more deep set goal for the Empire. Indeed, at the time of the American oil embargo in the summer of 1941, the oil cut off was not at the absolute forefront of Japanese policy maker\\'s minds. For quite some time before, the US had been seeking out ways to reduce oil exports to Japan, without resorting to a full embargo, via various export restrictions related to the US\\'s own military build up. Of equal or greater concern was the steady closing off of export options for machine tools, chemicals, specialty alloys, and other such goods from the US, as well as the asset freeze, which crippled Japan\\'s ability to acquire further resources on the international market (what little of an international market that was left, given the war in Europe). However, all of this is ultimately secondary, because while the asset freeze and full oil embargo may well have been the final straw that convinced Japanese leadership that the Southern Advance was their only option, the deterioration in US-Japanese relations that led the US to take such measures was only in place because of Japan\\'s own continued aggressive warring throughout the 1930s and into the 40s. It cannot be overstated how much of a presence the War in China had for Japanese policy making. Ultimately, it was the inability of Japan and the US to come to an understanding over China that led to the increasing economic pressure placed on Japan by the US in an effort to limit further Japanese aggression, which in turn led Japan to striking South, and going to war with the West. Yet how did we get to the War in China? It was not a war that many Japanese policy makers wanted. In the aftermath of World War I, the lesson Japan took away was that any future war would be a total war. Prior to World War I, Japanese war planning tended to assume that--whoever Japan was fighting--there would be neutral powers available for trade and loans in order to provide both the resources and financing that Japan lacked domestically. Moreover, the war would likely be short, completed while Japan had reserves of resources to rely upon. Yet, World War I had seen what was arguably the world\\'s preeminent industrial power, Germany, completely cut off from wider international markets, and forced to slowly wither away, its advanced industrial base starved of resources over a long, attritional war. How to deal with this threat would form the core of Japanese foreign and even domestic policy throughout the interwar period, and the proposed solution was autarky: a Japan that would not be vulnerable to interruption of international trade, and could support a full war economy on its own resources. In the late 1920s, the Cabinet Resources Bureau conducted a series of studies and exercises to develop a full scale mobilisation plan, that would determine what wartime demand for resources would be, and how Japan could meet those demands. While the plan was never fully drafted (its calculations would be thrown off by the Mukden Incident in 1931), early studies had shown that if Japan was to support a war economy, it could not limit itself to domestic resources in Home Islands and Korea. Access to additional resources would have to be acquired, and nearby Manchuria was the first goal. Manchurian iron deposits could become desperately needed steel, while coal deposits offered the prospect of synthetic oil for the Navy. While the Japanese had long had a strategic interest in Manchuria, seeing it as vital to securing their continental flank against Russia, the need for resources deepened the interest in controlling Manchuria economically, not just the strategically key railways. As Chiang Kai-Shek\\'s efforts to unify China under the Kuomintang banner came closer to fruition, and it became clear that he would not be willing to grant Japan the economic concessions in Manchuria they desired, the Kwantung Army took matters into its own hands, and occupied Manchuria on its own authority. The occupation of Manchuria, in turn, sparked Japanese interest in northern China as a whole, both to secure their new critical resource base in the puppet state of Manchukuo, but also for further sources of potential resources. To this end, the Army supported efforts to create either a wholly independent northern Chinese state that would be susceptible to Japanese domination, or at least an autonomous north with substantial economic concessions. This led to a continued intermingling of Japanese and local Chinese forces, while heavy handed Japanese rule increased Chinese distaste for Japan, while the Army\\'s typical response strategy of massive response to every threat to \"show strength\" laid the groundwork for a minor skirmish at the Marco Polo bridge in 1937 to escalate into a full scale war. In its efforts to \"bring an end to the war\", the Japanese often sought to expand it, committing more troops to the ongoing struggle in the north, landing an invasion force at Shanghai, and eventually the occupation of Indochina, all to try and \"end the war\". An interesting note throughout this whole process was how those total war planners in Japan were constant advocates for maintaining peace with the West. These total war planners sought to try and stabilize the situation in China, both to secure Manchukuo\\'s southern flank in the even of war with the Soviet Union, but also to prevent a war that would drain resources at the same time as Japan was seeking to build up its industrial base.The US in particular was a critical source for technology, capital goods, and other necessary materials to establish an expanded Japanese industrial base that could support an autarkic total war economy, and development of economic concessions in northern China could be a vital resource for further economic development. To go to war with China held the potential to completely derail Japanese development plans, if the war dragged on. And drag on it did. The war in China thus presented an almost insurmountable quagmire for Japan. The Army would not countenance withdrawal, arguing that this would be showing weakness that would only lead to future incursions. It was also draining the Japanese economy, as resources meant for further industrial build up were pulled into more immediate needs for supplying the War in China, and the United States became increasingly hostile. Moreover, the outbreak of the war in Europe in 1939 further worsened the situation, as prices for key materiel vital to war industries increased due to European demand, and the United States tightened up its export control regime to retain resources for its own military buildup. Simultaneously, the US wished to place economic pressure on Japan, hoping that such pressure would lead to a restoration of more moderate civilian leaders, rather than militarists, with whom the US could then negotiate with. Japanese demands for an almost exclusive economic zone in China, including recognition of Manchukuo were incompatible with US goals of maintaining the Open Door policy, and this incompatibility proved an immovable stumbling block in the continued US-Japanese negotiations that would ultimately culminate in the attack on Pearl Harbor. So, to sum up, while economic and resource concerns loomed large in the mind of Japanese policy makers, it was not the only issue at stake. This analysis has focused primarily on physical resources and military policy, but issues of currency reserves, balances of trade, Japanese exports, as well as an incredibly important cultural aspect all played a part in shaping Imperial Japanese policy in the lead up to the outbreak of World War II. Resources availability and access to resources was a major concern for Japan, that was a major part of it stumbling into the China War, which in turn led to the steady deterioration of relations culminating in the outbreak of the wider Pacific War.

       " 'I can only speak to experiences in Germany and Italy. In Germany every aspect of life was affected by the war and it\\'s fallout. Idk if you\\'re American, but think about the American youth experience during the Vietnam War. You\\'ve got boys being drafted and sent to war from all over the country and they\\'re experiencing that aspect of the war, right? And on the homefront you\\'ve got young people protesting and their brothers and friends are being drafted and some are coming back in boxes or coming back with PTSD. Music, TV, movies, and more. The war was being depicted or lived everywhere. It\\'s recognized as a generation defining event. Now think about Germany in WWI. An army of conscripts -millions of boys and men by the end of the war- and they\\'re living through all sorts of horror and squalor. On the home front lots of people are starving because of the blockade and harsh winters, and a lot of the food that does get made is being shipped to the soldiers on the front! In addition you\\'ve got civilians working in war industries that are firing on all cylinders, all sorts of fundraising campaigns for the war effort, and their brothers are coming home in boxes or with shell shock. And then once they surrendered, all of those boxes, all the hungry nights, all the hours in the factory, all the marching, and all the money that had been poured in by every German suddenly became pointless. The effect that this had on German society was clear, not only in diaries and letters from that time, but also in art and popular media like film. Weimar Germany had lots of great films coming out of it in the genre of \"shell shock cinema.\" Because of a taboo of speaking about the wartime experiences in the immediate aftermath, shell shock cinema often used more abstract symbolism to talk about the war. Movies like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Metropolis, M, and some might even argue Nosferatu. All of these films were influenced by the German experience during WWI. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is probably one of the more heavy handed of the movies, and it\\'s free on YouTube Aside from very forward thinking camera shots, use of shadow, and colored film, this movie is interesting because it came out in 1920 and dealt specifically with the way in which the German people, represented by the protagonist who ends the movie in an insane asylum, saw themselves in relation to the government/authority, represented by Dr. Caligari who runs that insane asylum. Metropolis deals with the evils of industry and capitalism, which was seen by some veterans like Peter Hammerer as the force responsible for the war. In German expressionist paintings as well, the experiences of Germans were reflected by artists like Otto Dix who painted this harrowing image of mutilated WWI veterans. The effects of the war were visible and widespread. In Germany a man\\'s service in WWI was absolutely important. The experience of being a soldier in the biggest and most grotesque war the world had seen separated society into those who understood what it was like and those who didn\\'t. Every German had a personal connection to the war, but the experiences of frontline soldiers were so extreme yet so commonplace that it defined a generation of boys and young men. The fact that it became so common in literature, film, and paintings of that time supports this. Were it not so, then In the case of Italy, I actually have more experience reading from sources after the war, but these are still quite revealing. During WWI about 5.5 million Italian boys and men served in the military. 8,000 of them were volunteers. The difference here is that Italy was on the winning side. The arditi, who many people have come to know from Battlefield 1, were very proud of their service as an elite force that prevailed, unlike the German stormtroopers who, despite being just as brave, ultimately lost. It was members of the arditi, along with members of the mobile mountain troops of the bersaglieri, who followed Italian nationalist, author, and war-hero Gabriele D\\'annunzio into the city of Fiume to take it for Italy in 1919. These were well known and well respected parts of the military with which all Italians would be familiar due to wartime propaganda. Their experiences during the war have rise to the idea that Italy was owed the city of Fiume because of their sacrifice. Were it not for their wartime service specifically, they likely would not have done it, and likely would not have been greeted so warmly by the ethnic Italians who made up the majority of Fiume\\'s residency. It was to these veterans that the early members of the fascist squadristi and blackshirts would look up. The demographics of the squadristi rank and file were quite young. R. Suzzi Valli found that, \"nearly 90 per cent of the squadristi in Bologna and 83.5 per cent of those in Florence were aged between sixteen and twenty-seven, and that while the great majority of the squad leaders were demobilised junior officers, more than half of their rank-and-file followers were not old enough to have fought in the war.\" They had missed out on the event that defined their generation. For many of them, this was their chance to participate in the same struggle that their older brothers had: bringing glory to Italy. Giulio Teoni, who joined the blackshirts as a 16 year old in 1920, wrote \"It seemed our turn had now come to continue the work of our elder brothers.\" So even if it wasn\\'t important to the veterans themselves, it was definitely important to their younger siblings. In the case of Italy I\\'ve generally spent more time looking at the first hand accounts of early fascists like Teoni, and very little time looking at those of veterans, so I can\\'t speak to what the veterans thought of their place in society or the war\\'s place in their lives. But by looking at the testimony of Teoni and others like him, as well as the data provided by Valli, i think it can safely be said that in the immediate aftermath of the war Italian civilians, particularly young boys, thought that the status of the veterans was important. What i think would be an interesting follow-up question to ask would be: how much of a role did the status of \"Great War veteran\" play in Germany and Italy before the rise of the Nazis and Fascists respectively, vs. after? I know this isn\\'t quite what you were looking for, but it\\'s as close as I can get you! Hopefully this\\'ll at least give you an idea.

       " \"The petit bourgeoisie takes up a fairly special position in the marxist notion of class division. While the two main categories remain the (haute) bourgeoisie and the proletariat, those who own the means of production and those who don't, this subdivision will form from the proletariat during times of economic growth and prosperity. They're a varied bunch: from small shopkeepers to bureaucrats and politicians to well-off farmers. Their unifying characteristic is that their economic circumstances have led them to turn away from identifying as a proletarian, with them instead turning towards the haute bourgeois. After all, economically speaking, they're no longer bound to the factories or the fields of someone else. They have reached a level of economic stability that most of the proletariat can only dream of. So they stop seeing themselves as part of the working class, and instead turn to the haute bourgeoisie. This turn involves taking over and emulating the worldview and morals of the bourgeois. With it comes a loss and rejection of the idea that there's a systemic reason why the rich are rich and the poor are poor. They're not just what comes down to a boil on the head of the proletariat. No, they're the step between both classes, part of the natural progression from one to the other. The way to the top is open and all they need is to put in the work. The reality is of course different. Capitalism goes into crisis every few decades, and sooner or later one of those crises will be large enough to also start affecting the petit bourgeois. They don't have the systemic safeguards (partially built in by a state which they will find out the hard way carries water only for the haute bourgeois) the actual bourgeoisie does, so they find themselves under pressure. Suddenly they do have to worry about paying their bills. They do run the risk of losing their jobs. But, having foregone any sort of class awareness, they are at a loss as to why this is happening. They just know that it is happening. No longer equipped with a systemic answer, they turn towards the individualism they took on from the haute bourgeoisie. Someone is to blame for their economic woes. Someone is preventing them from taking that final step towards joining the elite. But who? The poor and the rest of the proletariat - who unlike them are lazy and shiftless, who just won't put in the necessary work to rise from their station. The marxists, the socialists, the union militants who fill the proles' heads with lies about why they have not, and who hurt the nation's welfare with their strikes and demands for better working conditions. But also the foreign powers, who conspire against us and prevent us from taking our rightful place in the sun. But the petit bourgeois also look up and can't help but see the horrors of the capitalist system - be in the form of the landlord who threatens them with eviction, the bank who won't give them another loan, the wealthy getting away with things they can't get away with. The answers the liberal factions of the bourgeoisie provide them - about the free market, about the ideals of the enlightenment, about the fairness of capitalism - suddenly start to ring hollow. After all, they don't explain why the petit bourgeois are suddenly under pressure too. But they have fully bought into the bourgeois ideology. So there must be an individualistic factor combining these examples. And somewhere, someone suggests a factor: these people, the people who wield such great influence over your life, and who clearly got to where they are by means of deceit and theft rather than hard work (surely!) - what if they're Jewish? And that's where fascism comes in. Other forms of fascism than that present in Germany might choose a different scapegoat that the Jewish people, but they always find someone. In Germany, at least, the petit bourgeoisie was a very solid base in Hitler's rise to power. And herein lies the marxist critique of the petit bourgeois. The petit bourgeois is a subdivision of the proletariat which rejects its class position in favour of aspirations towards belonging to the haute bourgeoisie. This position will come under pressure as they inevitably come face to face with the realities of the capitalist system, from which they are very much not shielded. This pressure leads to friction between their material reality and the beliefs they hold. They refuse to accept the marxist answer as to what's happening, while at the same time their material reality is completely at odds with the traditional liberal capitalist view which they bought into before. This makes them uniquely vulnerable and attracted to fascist ideologies - which provide a narrative which seeks to ease this friction, albeit with pure bullshit. So not only does the petit bourgeoisie weaken the position of the working class by essentially betraying them, this betrayal eventually leads them to become openly hostile to the working class in the long run.\",\n",
       " 'Hi there, On /r/AskHistorians we often get questions along the lines of \\'what did Hitler think about X\\' - I mean, as an April Fools joke one year, we changed the sub to /r/AskAboutHitler. However, for better or worse, many of these questions about what Hitler thought are, in the literal sense, unanswerable. We don\\'t know what Hitler thought about many things, and especially about things which were inconsequential for him. Hitler did not keep a diary, and the collections of his private conversations is disjointed and nowhere near complete, being almost completely dependent on the post-war recollection of his intimates (who may also be unreliable in their recollections, especially given those circumstances). Of course, you may still get an answer to this particular question! However, broadly speaking, proving the negative is very hard (there could be an 1965 article on the topic in Swahili), and if you\\'ve asked a question which is almost certainly \"We don\\'t know, and he probably didn\\'t care anyways\", few historians familiar with the topic matter actually are going to want to put in the necessary gruntwork, doubly so about a man who on a personal level was decidedly uninteresting.

       " '\"the answer is simple; lots of Jews protested against WW1 for good reason, which caused Kaiser wilhelm ii to abdicate, thus causing Germany to lose WW1 and getting wrecked by the treaty of versailles\" I\\'d like to seriously interrogate this. It\\'s definitely what a lot of Germans on the right thought, ie, that there was a domestic \"Stab in the Back\" of the German military in November 1918, causing them to lose the war, and that this was caused by movements on the left controlled by Jews. However: this is not an accurate understanding of what actually happened. While there were some prominent members of, say, the USPD and Spartakist League who were of Jewish backgrounds, such as Rosa Luxemburg, they were by no means a majority of those groups\\' members. German Jews were pretty well assimilated and involved in politics across the spectrum in Germany before and after 1918 (Walter Rathenau, Germany\\'s foreign minister until his assassination in 1922, was a political liberal in Weimar Germany, for example). The German military, interestingly enough, conducted a \"Jewish Census\" (Judenzählung) in 1916, to provide data supporting the antisemitic charge that German Jews were opposed to the war effort. The census actually found the opposite, namely that Jews were serving in the German military, being killed in battle, and winning decorations out of proportion to what their relatively small numbers would have indicated (the military suppressed the results and the military supported groups putting out antisemitic literature instead). Anyway: by the time that the mutinies spread across Germany and Kaiser Wilhelm abdicated, the German military was militarily beaten, and being pushed back across the Western Front. The numbers one and two in the German General Staff, Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff (who would later participate in the Beer Hall Putsch with Hitler and become a major far-right German nationalist) had already told the Kaiser on September 29 - a good month before the mutinies - that the war was unwinnable and that Germany needed to ask for an armistice. This is important, because the Dolchstosslegende (\"Stab in the Back Myth\"), which was later very much personally circulated by Ludendorff, was a conscious effort to take the blame for Germany\\'s military defeat off of the military command, and put it squarely on the political Left (and on German Jews). I get this doesn\\'t really answer the part of the question as to where Hitler\\'s far-right extreme nationalism came from, although I would note that, as u/jschooltiger\\'s comment shows, how he personally came to this is really less important than how a large chunk of the German political spectrum did (and quite a big chunk of the German right felt this way). The defeat in World War I for Germany was quite shocking - in large part because the German public had assumed right until the end that they were on the verge of victory, and that the millions of German dead and wounded would be vindicated in the peace settlement. The Treaty of Versailles was universally hated (despite being assassinated by members of the German far right, Rathenau was actually working to renegotiate aspects of the peace settlement in Germany\\'s favor). The idea that political leftists, and specifically Jews, were in fact the traitors of an ever-victorious German military was a comforting lie that many were willing to believe, and that those actually responsible for the defeat were all to willing to propagate.',\n",
       " \"I think you really have two different though closely related questions here. The first is how have people communicated with peoples they have no previous knowledge of or common language with. The second is how have different polities (the term nation has implications I won't get into here) establish communications with each other. I will be answering the first question but in doing so may reveal insights about the second, as communications between polities is necessarily done through people. On the linguistic side of things one should note that people can learn languages they have no experience of if immersed in it. I'll use the example of the Spanish first arriving in Mesoamerica as I've read Bernal Diaz's account of the conquest of Mexico recently enough that its still somewhat fresh in my head. Diaz was part of the first expeditions from the Spanish colonies in the Caribbean to what is today Mexico. On the first journey the party lands in the Yucatan peninsula and are ambushed by the local Maya people. On retreating the Spaniards manage to capture two locals who learned Spanish over time and acted as interpreters between the Spanish and the Maya leaders they encountered. When the Spaniards returned to Mexico on the voyage with Hernan Cortes at the helm that would become the voyage of the conquest of Mexico they land on the island of Cozumel off the Yucatan coast and hear that there are Spaniards living as slaves on the mainland. Diaz recounts that these two Spaniards were survivors of a shipwreck in the Caribbean and inadvertently become the first Spaniards in Mexico. They were enslaved by the Maya and learned their language. One of the men, Gonzalo Guerrero, became part of the community and married a local woman, whereas the other, Jeronimo de Aguilar remained a slave. When the Spanish party arrived Guerrero chose to remain with his Maya family and community while Aguilar joined the Spanish fleet and acted as a key interpreter between the local people and Spaniards. After spending time in and around the Yucatan the fleet moves westwards towards Tenochtitlan and the Aztecs. Aguilar does not speak the languages of the peoples of central Mexico but following another battle on the Yucatan coast the Spanish are given a number of slaves, including a woman known as Marina or La Malinche. La Malinche serves a key role in communication between the Spaniards the people of central Mexico because despite not knowing Spanish she does speak one of the languages that Aguilar also speaks (I believe it was Chontal Maya though I could be mistaken). La Malinche worked with Aguilar as interpreters for Cortes and the rest of the fleet, at least until she learned enough Spanish translate on her own. So by the time the Spanish arrived in the Aztec capital they already had an interpreter capable of speaking the languages of both parties, enabling them to communicate with each other. One should note that this is but one primary source of the conquest of Mexico and Diaz was not merely an observer but active participant in these events. He has a tendency to focus on the actions of his fellow Spaniards to a greater degree than that of others such as the indigenous peoples involved. While there are a number of other primary sources related to the conquest of Mexico I can't speak to the extent to which they mention communication barriers or translators.\",\n",
       " 'Premarital pregnancy was rare among the upper classes, because girls were chaperoned and their activities controlled. In the middle classes it was fairly rare, and the girl was swiftly married to her seducer, or sent away to give birth secretly and the child adopted. Many working class women became pregnant outside of marriage; however, because of the social stigma, the fear of losing their paid work, and lack of money to raise the child, many concealed the pregnancy. If, as was common, a domestic servant became pregnant as a result of seduction by her employer, sometimes the family expelled the girl from the house, but if the seducer was working class the couple was often pressured into marrying.',\n",
       " 'There\\'s always more to be said, but in the meantime you can find answers about how the Quebecois were able to preserve their language and culture after the fall of New France in this thread by u/enygma9753. Anti-Catholic discrimination was built into English laws since the Reformation and these biases remained soon after the capitulation of French forces at Quebec and Montreal . Catholics were barred from the highest offices in the now British province of Quebec. They could not run for public office or vote. The British deeply mistrusted the Jesuit order, who had proselytized in Canada among the native peoples for some 150 years, and would suppress the order for decades. Britain, while still at war with France in the Maritimes in the 1750\\'s, deported the entire Acadian population (who were actively resisting the British in the conflict) and vacated the lands for Protestant settlement. The British merchant classes and New England settlers on the frontier had hoped, even expected, that the resident Quebecois (Canadiens, or habitants, as they were called at the time) would receive similar treatment. The merchants hoped to recreate a Protestant Ascendancy in Quebec, where the local gentry would be replaced by English Protestant elites and French-Catholics relegated to second-class citizens. This fate didn\\'t befall French Canada in large part because British authorities opted to win hearts and minds. While the French were indeed outnumbered when the Thirteen Colonies are included (20 British for every 1 French), in Quebec itself, the French were the majority -- some 70-80,000 by the end of the Seven Years War. While British authorities wanted overwhelming English Protestant settlement to one day supplant the local population and assimilate them into British culture, they soon realized that they had a large population of French Catholic subjects -- accustomed to alien laws and landholding practices -- who could potentially rise up in rebellion if mistreated. The expected mass immigration of American colonists also didn\\'t materialize: the settlers saw the Canadian climate and lands to be much harsher and wanted to move west, not north. The military (and later) civil governor of Quebec, James Murray, found working in cooperation with the Quebec seigneurial elites and local Catholic hierarchy to be more effective in placating the local populace. He eased several anti-Catholic and language restrictions and permitted continuation of Quebec\\'s civil code and aspects of the seigneurial system. These accommodations, and Murray\\'s refusal to permit a New England-style assembly in Quebec, annoyed the British merchants who felt entitled to their preferential \"rights as Englishman\". They felt alienated -- Murray didn\\'t like them either -- and they complained to London. Murray was eventually recalled to Britain in 1766, but his successor Guy Carleton continued this policy of accommodation and tolerance. These civil liberites were later guaranteed under British law in the 1774 Quebec Act. This ensured the survival of the Quebecois culture and faith as well as their acceptance of, if not loyalty to, British rule when the Thirteen Colonies rose up in rebellion.',\n",
       " 'The method of calculating years that we use is generally based on the supposed birth of Jesus Christ. AD stands for Anno Domini, which is lating for something like \"year of God\". However, there is very little evidence for the life of Jesus and when he lived. It depends on whether one accepts the accounts in the Bible as evidence. There are some context clues that can be used to narrow the birth of Jesus down to a certain time period. The Bible mentions the events of the life of Jesus in relation to certain Roman politicians, which we know a lot more about, for example the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius and at what time Pilate was governor of that province. If you follow all that evidence There is even some debate among historians about whether we can be sure there was a Jesus at all, although most . Bart Ehrman is probably the modern academic that has written most about Jesus and is very well known. Before this became common during the early middle ages, there were many different ways of calculating which year it was across the globe, most of which are based in some other religious event. The jewish calendar and the chinese calendar, for example. The romans or the ancient greeks would use the date at which officials held office. For example, during the republic, the romans would date the years based on who was consul (a yearly position). If you read the roman historian Tacitus, for example, he will say that certain events happened in the year that x and y was consul. The ancient greeks would date it after the highest officials in each city state. The athenians would date it after who was archon, but other cities would date it after their own officials. This made it very difficult to keep track of the year across the city-state borders, so towards the end of the classical era, it was common in Greece to keep track of years in olympiads (they held the Olympics every 4 years, like we do), and since this was a panhellenic event, if you said that your son was born in a specific olympic year, or 3 olympiads ago, all the other greeks would know how old he was.',\n",
       " 'It\\'s kind of simple, really. If they\\'re not spinning on their axis, oblong bullets tumble, and when oblong bullets tumble they will fly off in unpredictable directions. At a shooting range, this is called \"keyholing\", because of the slotted holes the bullets make in the target. Those keyholes are seldom hitting the bullseye, except by accident. A round ball will also tumble if it\\'s not spinning on its axis, but for the first 100 meters or so it will still go relatively straight- the effect ( a difference in air pressure on the sides of the ball) is not as great as for an oblong bullet. It will travel straighter over longer distances if it is spinning on its axis- that\\'s why rifling works- but it needs much less spin than an oblong bullet- maybe one turn in 2 meters. In the early rifles, it was necessary to wrap the ball in a patch in order to seal it and make it gripped by the rifling. Why patched oblong bullets weren\\'t used is not really clear, but oblong bullets don\\'t work as well with a patch- because they need a faster spin, the rifling has to have a faster twist and the patch can\\'t really grip them tightly enough to impart the spin....or, more precisely, a patched oblong bullet that is able to be pushed down the barrel of a muzzleloader by a normal human with a typical ramrod will not be gripped firmly enough. In the 1850\\'s the French invented an oblong bullet that would expand to fit the rifling when the gun was fired, the famous Minié bullet. It didn\\'t need to be patched. Soon after that, breechloading guns became standard, and so all bullets could be a very tight fit, and so all of them could be pointy.',\n",

       " 'The short answer is that it was allowed to a select few who had the economic means and political permission. Islam as a whole was controlled but not banned in the Soviet Union. The restrictions on Islam relaxed, as did most other limits on free expression, toward the end of the Soviet period. In 1990, the Soviet Union went so far as to charter direct flights between Moscow and Saudi Arabia for the pilgrimage. This was a stark change from 1945 to 1953, when official pilgrimages were banned, and from the 1920s and 1930s when an atheist campaign violently fought the Islamic presence in central Asia. In 1956, 18 pilgrims were flown from Moscow to Cairo and on to Mecca during what the New York Times called an effort \"to counteract the resentment among non-Communist Moslems in the Middle East and Pakistan born of frequent reports about the Soviet government\\'s drive against Mohammedanism within its own borders.\" That resentment showed up the year after, when 21 Soviet pilgrims were booed and showered with tomatoes in the streets of Mecca. According to that 1954 account, the Soviet pilgrims were restricted to Mecca proper and were not permitted to participate in the other activities of the Hajj. The Soviet Union started relaxing restrictions on Islam in the 1950s and 1960s due to the need to maintain good relations with Islamic countries in the Middle East. Muftis from the Soviet Union were de facto diplomats to the Middle East, as Alexandre Bennigsen wrote in an article published in the April 1988 issue of Third World Quarterly. A 1959 issue of the Times included a fascinating story about how Middle Eastern fans of the Soviet Union were attempting to reconcile communism with Islam. It\\'s not particularly related to the Hajj, but it might be interesting to you. Twenty-five years later, the Times ran a whole series on Islam and the Middle East. Included in that series was an interesting piece about Islam in the Soviet Union in 1974. It says in part: \"In addition, a pilgrimage to Mecca is provided only for a token delegation of 20 to 25 annually. Even the director of the madrasah said he had never been to Mecca. The numbers are small, Sheik Abdullayev said, because without a Saudi embassy in Moscow, pilgrims must go to Egypt or Syria to try to get visas. But others see it differently. One imam who has been trying for a decade to visit Mecca contended that the pilgrims are chosen by authorities in Moscow and that only 10 to 15 members of each delegation are believers. The rest, he said, are from the K.G.B., the secret police. He said the K.G.B. also had agents in the government\\'s Moslem religious board.\" When the direct flights were announced in 1990, the New York Times reported that \"Leaders of Islamic organizations and state religious councils here said today that in recent years no more than about 18 or 20 Soviet citizens a year were granted permission by Soviet authorities to make the pilgrimage.\" Khadzhi Adil Zeinalov, a leading Islamic figure in Baku, Azerbaijan, was one of only three people permitted to go on Hajj from Azerbaijan in 1982, for example. When the direct flights were announced, he explained that it took months to navigate the bureaucracy needed for the trip\\'s approval. Under Soviet law, children could receive religious training only at home. At school and in public, atheism was the lesson of the day. The Soviet government operated directorates that administered Islamic practice. It named officials to lead those directorates. In practice, these officials executed the orders of Moscow and were used in campaigns against such things as pilgrimages, even local ones within the bounds of the Soviet Union. Even after the Soviet Union, it took time for the Islamic regions of the former Soviet states to pick up participation. In 2000, for example, only about 520 people went on Hajj from Tajikistan. By 2008, the figure was 10 times that. An improving economy, the end of a civil war, and the Islamization of the region were two factors in the increase. Adeeb Khalid\\'s Islam after Communism: Religion and Politics in Central Asia was published in 2007 by University of California Press and would be a good read for you, particularly the third through fifth chapters, which cover Islam between 1917 and 1991 in the Soviet Union. Khalid\\'s written some pretty good papers as well, which you can find if you search JSTOR or some other database. I also suggest picking up Martha Brill Olcott\\'s In the Whirlwind of Jihad, which examines Islam in Uzbekistan. But Olcott\\'s book won\\'t be a precise answer to your question. The issue of Islam in the Soviet Union needs to be explored more, as she herself states in the fourth chapter: \"The task of writing a complete history of Islam in this period will rest with another generation, as it requires that the archives of the Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia and Kazakhstan as well as Soviet archives be exhaustively researched, preferably by a scholar with little stake in the outcome of the findings.\"',\n",

       " \"There was immense interest in extraterrestrials as a real possibility in the 1970s onward (you'll find several rather famous purported UFO sightings in the USSR just as you will in the USA, e.g. the Voronezh incident); these aliens are envisioned more generally as a potential problem, as your quote shows. UFO sightings peak in the 1950s-1970s, and are reoriented in a more scientific way through American initiatives like SETI and Soviet scholars like Iosif Shklovsky. There is a pressing anxiety about extraterrestrials and space more generally accentuating the smallness and fragility of humanity. The Soviet case inherits a rather unique conception of extraterrestrials, originating in the late 19th century with the philosophy of cosmism and probably hitting its zenith in the earliest years of the Soviet Union. Extraterrestrials are, of course, inextricably linked to space travel (to or from!). There are some excellent films that grapple with some of these questions (and are good movies!) that I recommend: Solaris, Stalker, Planeta Bur, and Per Aspera Ad Astra all present different views of aliens: as beneficent, as insidious, as straightforward monsters. I've written here on earlier visions of space travel and extraterrestrials. Red Star is an aspirational novel where the utopian visions of the future are transposed to extraterrestrials; Zamyatin's We is a dystopian exploration of the same. Bogdanov is an author of debatable quality, but his characters are wonderful reflections of early Bolshevik thinking. Tolstoy's Aelita is a fantastic novel where an engineer travels to Mars and discovers an advanced civilization populated by a proletarian class, with some echoes of Germinal. There's an intriguing film on Aelita, with wonderfully Bolshevik sets, in 1924.

       " '\"I know that the Chaldaeans and Indian sages were the first to say that the soul of man is immortal, and have been followed by some of the Greeks, particularly by Plato the son of Ariston.\" (Pausanias, Description of Greece 4.32.4) Now that\\'s an arresting passage. An ancient author - albeit one who wrote a half-millennium after Plato\\'s death - stating outright that Plato derived one of his most important doctrines from India. But the fact that an ancient author claims something does not, of course, make that thing true, and very few classicists think that Plato derived any of his core doctrines from non-Greek sources. Ancient claims to the contrary reflect an impulse as old as Greco-Roman civilization: to see the ancient cultures of the east as a source of deep, if sometimes dangerous, wisdom. The Greeks and Romans assumed that Plato traveled widely, and there is no particular reason to doubt that he did. We don\\'t really know where he went, since our sources about his life - with the partial exception of the spuriously autobiographical Seventh Letter - are late and unreliable. Egypt was then (depending on the time of Plato\\'s visit) either part of the Persian Empire or under the rule of the native 30th Dynasty. In either case, Egypt was - though not nearly to the extent that it would be in the Hellenistic and Roman periods - connected by trade with India. It is conceivable that Plato could have encountered someone who had been to India, or someone who knew someone who had. But there is no direct evidence - in Plato\\'s own works or those of his contemporaries - that any Greek writing before Alexander\\'s conquests had a substantive understanding of Indian religion or philosophy. There were of course rumors and reports about the far east - one thinks of Herodotus\\' gold-digging ants, said to live in the deserts of northern India - and a few authors active during or before Plato\\'s lifetime produced works purporting to describe Indian customs. With the exception of Herodotus, these authors survive only in excerpts. They do not seem, however, to have been especially accurate; the most (in)famous of them, Ctesias, was apparently responsible for the myth of the skiapods, men who hopped around on a single enormous foot, and then (when wearied by hopping) used their feet as umbrellas as they napped. What, if anything, Ctesias had to say about Buddhism is unknown, but it is unlikely to have been inspiring. Nor is there any internal evidence for Buddhist doctrines in Plato\\'s works - or so Richard Stoneman concludes in his recent book on the Greek Experience of India. There was the potential for real intellectual cross-fertilization between the Greek and Indian traditions; Stoneman, for example, thinks that the philosophy of Pyrrho of Elis was deeply influenced by Buddhism. Pyrrho, however, was born a generation after Plato, and supposedly accompanied Alexander to India. He was, in other words, exposed to Indian philosophy in a way that only became possible in the wake of Alexander\\'s conquests. During the Hellenistic period, a considerable number of Greeks in the Indo-Greek kingdoms would convert to Buddhism (the Questions of King Menander are the most famous product). But in the Mediterranean world, Buddhism remained an ill-understood religion, known - if at all - through the distorted mirror of Manicheism or the late antique fable of Barlaam and Joasaph If Plato knew anything substantial about the Buddha or Buddhism, in other words, he kept it to himself.',\n",

       " \"I’m going to take a different route from others who have commented and write more on the history of philosophy and the possible connection between Indian/Buddhist and Greek philosophy, which I am more familiar with. In Platonism the idea of reincarnation is central to Platonic ontology and epistemology. In the Phaedo, written by Plato, which recounts Socrates last dialogue with Cebes and Simmias before his death, Plato presents arguments in favor of reincarnation. As stated by Plato in the Phaedo, “The living come from the dead, just as the dead come from the living; and if this is true, then the souls of the dead must be in some place out of which they come again.” In the Phaedo, Plato’s argument for the immortality of the soul, and its reincarnation in a body, is as follows: “If generation were in a straight line only, and there was no compensation or circle in nature, no turn or return into one another, then you know that all things would at last have the same form and pass into the same state, and there would be no more generation of them.” Therefore, the immortality of the soul, as well as its reincarnation in a body, is necessary for the continuation of life and existence. However, it is highly unlikely that Plato derived such ideas from Indian philosophy, and especially Buddhism. If we’re looking for Indian influence on Greek philosophy, and here it is still unlikely, we could possibly look towards Pythagoras, who Plato likely derived the idea of reincarnation and the immortality of the soul from. According to Herodotus in his Histories, the idea of reincarnation began in Egypt: “The Egyptians were the first to declare this doctrine, too, that the human soul is immortal, and each time the body perishes it enters into another animal as it is born. When it has made a circuit of all terrestrial, marine, and winged animals, it once again enters a human body as it is born. Its circuit takes three thousand years. Some Greeks have this doctrine, some earlier and some later, as if it were peculiar to them. I know their names, but do not write them.” Moreover, Porphyry, in The Life of Pythagoras, writes that Pythagoras introduced the idea of reincarnation and the immortality of the soul into Western philosophy: “It was especially well known by all that first he declares that the soul is immortal; then it changes into other kinds of animals; in addition that things that happen recur at certain intervals, that nothing is absolutely new, and that all things that come to be alive must be thought akin. Pythagoras seems to have been the first to introduce these opinions into Greece.” Pythagoras, for much of his early life, studied extensively in Egypt, which sat at the juncture between Mediterranean and Asian civilizations. Pythagoras also travelled to Babylonia, and spent some time there, where it is possible but not likely that he came into contact with Indian philosophy. Thus, it is possible (but not likely) that Pythagoras learnt of reincarnation from a second hand source, who was familiar with Indian philosophy, in either Egypt or Babylonia. Although Pythagoras lived before the alleged time of the Buddha, the idea of reincarnation was likely already established in Indian philosophy. Considering that there are so many conflicting accounts of Pythagoras’ life however, we cannot say for certain who Pythagoras learned of reincarnation from, and whether or not this person learnt of reincarnation from Indian philosophers. While Pythagoras is credited by several writers with having introduced the idea of reincarnation and the immortality of the soul, Plato was largely responsible for popularizing the idea in Western philosophy through his dialogues. Ultimately, it would be unwise to definitively assert that Pythagoras, and by extension Plato, learnt of reincarnation from Indian philosophers, and particularly Buddhism. What is most likely, given the available historical records, is that the idea of reincarnation which Pythagoras learnt of in Egypt, was already well known and established in Egypt and neighboring civilizations, and whether or not these civilizations adopted this idea from Indian philosophy is of course open to further investigation. It is possible that different cultures and religions came up with their own conception of reincarnation independently of one another, or perhaps the idea really did originate in India and was introduced over the centuries into other cultures. However, this is mere speculation and should be taken as a factual assertion as to the origin of the idea of reincarnation and the immortality of the soul. I hope this helps you develop a more informed understanding of Platonic philosophy and the influence of Egypt, and possibly India, on Western philosophy. If anybody has any corrections they'd like to offer, feel free to do so. This is my first time posting. Edit: For another possible connection between Greek and Indian philosophy, which is also a disputed connection, we can look to Ammonius Saccas, who was the teacher of Plotinus, the founder of Neoplatonism. There is scholarship that supports the idea that Ammonius Saccas was of Indian origin. Those who believe that Ammonius was of Indian origin point to the efforts of Plotinus to travel to Persia and India after the death of Ammonius, which indicates that Plotinus may have been aware of Persian and Indian philosophy through Ammonius. Supporters of the theory that Ammonius was of Indian origin also highlight the similarity between the names Saccas and Sākyas, an ancient Indian clan. However, Ammonius Saccas left no philosophical writings behind and no memoir, and so he is a very obscure figure in the history of philosophy and little is known for certain about who he was and where he came from, asides from the fact that he was the teacher of Plotinus.

       " 'There\\'s no threshold or checklist you can point to as definitive. In fact, one of the most consistent arguments made by loyalists was that the American Whigs had no hard evidence that their rights were abridged in any significant material way. Certainly, not in any way that truly violated the constituted and traditional authority of the British Crown and the Imperial metropole. Rather, what the framers argued was much more philosophical and conceptual than concrete. To be sure, the framers had specific taxes and pieces of legislation they used to bolster their case, but that case always relied on adopting the philosophical framework of classical republicanism. Now, what is classical republicanism? At its heart, it was a belief in a limited, representative government that allowed for the safe distribution of power amongst those best suited to wield it. It was an Enlightenment political project that sought to move power from an hereditary aristocracy to what was termed \"nature\\'s aristocracy,\" or men of education and means who were best able to wisely exercise political power. One writer described his position, \"It is not wealth - it is not family - it is not either of these alone, nor both of them together, though I readily allow neither is to be disregarded, that will qualify men for important seats in government, unless they are rich and honorable in other and more important respects\" (Bailyn, 309). As the name suggests, classical republicanism was derived from the governments and political theories that emerged in ancient Greece and Rome. Now, we should not assume that the American framers and the European Enlightenment theorists had their ancient history right, but instead they cribbed from existing sources to create a political system that they believed would avoid the excesses of the Roman empire and the more recent (and traumatizing to their minds) wars of religion and emergence of the absolutist state. Reading the tracts and pamphlets of the era you see history painted with a broad and dark brush, where heroes like the Roman Cincinnatus are extinguished in nearly two millennia of despotism and intellectual dark ages. A side note, but the framers did not view the Pilgrims and Puritans as forebearers of the new nation, but rather the exact thing they wished to break away from. The capacity to control and wield political power is really at the heart of all of this. Bernard Bailyn notes in The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution that, \"The theory of politics that emerges from the political literature of the pre-Revolutionary years rests on the belief that what lay behind every political scene, the ultimate explanation of every political controversy, was the disposition of power,\" . This is why people like Madison and Hamilton feared democracy. They weren\\'t worried about democracy as we understand it, where people have a voice and a vote for their government, but rather \"pure\" democracy as they understood Athens, where the passions of the moment could turn political power into an instrument of mob violence. This is also why many of them feared standing armies, strong banking establishments, and corporations (at that time, corporations had charters from governments and typically operated specific monopolies in exchange for tax revenue and kickbacks), Those institutions were accountable only to those who gave them money and authority and lacked the moral grounding in the traditional body politic. In addition to seeking appropriate leadership and civic institution, the theory of classical republicanism relied heavily on what its adherents called \"civic virtue.\" Civic virtue held that government could only function if the people it represented were virtuous and vigilant. A perfectly structured republican government could slide into tyranny, in this theory, if the people represented by that government allowed corruption. The end result would be despotism. In fact, it was believed that republicanism was impossible without civic virtue. Madison, in a speech to the Virginia Constitutional Convention, argued, \"the people will have virtue and intelligence to select men of virtue and wisdom. Is there no virtue among us? If there be not we are in a wretched situation. No theoretical checks, no form of government, can render us secure. To suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people is a chimerical idea.\" Loyalist attacks against the American Whigs argued that, \"Not only was the rebellion rupturing the people\\'s habitual obedience to the constituted government, but by the establishment of republicanism the Whigs were also founding their new governments solely on the people\\'s voluntary acquiescence,\" (Wood, The Creation of the American Republic, 67). So, what made a government tyrannical to the radical Whigs of the Imperial Crisis? Any constituted government that derived its power from naked force or a tradition of assumed, divine authority was immediately suspect. The British Empire, based on Parliamentary rule and constitutional monarchy in the wake of the Revolution of 1688 was considered a good model to Whigs, but certainly capable of abuse, especially when the traditional rights of self governance in the colonies were limited. The act of taxing the colonies was not dangerous to the American Whigs. The act of taxing the colonies without the consent of the taxed, without set limits for the taxing authority, and without considering the inherent rights of the community being taxed, was seen as a slippery slope to true tyranny. A final note, governance itself, and the limitations of rights, were not considered tyrannical in-and-of themselves. Saul Cornell noted of the Antifederalist arguments against the Constitution, that even the most radical republicans \"accepted the important distinction between unalienable and alienable rights. Certain rights were unalienable and could never be ceded by individuals... Other rights were alienable but could be compromised only when the good of society demanded such sacrifices... Alienable rights were political rights, rights that resulted from the creation of a polity... Limits on liberty were permissible as long as laws were enacted by representatives of the people,\" (The Other Founders: Anti-Federalism & the Dissenting Tradition in America, 1788-1828, 86). In other words, the Whiskey Rebellion, for example, was not a valid critique of government, since the government was republican in nature, responsive to the people, and acting within its set and constitutional boundaries.',\n",

If you're wondering why a subject that seems very important to you isn't being covered in greater depth, this is actually sort of mission accomplished for the teacher, because it means that now you have your topic for an essay or research paper, or at the very least it means that you're motivated now to read about history on your own. So the question is, why was the Communist Manifesto left out and not something else? From what I remember, which corresponds with what I found after briefly looking at materials available online, the APUSH curriculum addresses communism almost exclusively in terms of US geopolitical strategy and the Cold War. The Communist Manifesto would not be terribly useful for understanding the Soviet Union's place in American foreign policy after 1945, or even for understanding the Soviets' own strategic and ideological motivations at this point. The Red Scare is dealt with basically in terms of the government's repressive reaction to radicalism and unrest during and immediately after the First World War, rather than as part of a broader history of American left-wing movements, which are barely discussed. The College Board made the decision that Marxist ideology is not a significant enough factor in US history to warrant great attention, even if the Soviet Union as a geopolitical rival is. This isn't surprising for a curriculum which provides a basic overview of US political history, with some vague gestures towards cultural and economic history and the history of social movements when absolutely necessary. This may not be the right way to approach teaching US history, and there are certainly some hidden political narratives behind the APUSH curriculum, which has been the subject of controversy semi-recently (someone else might be in a better position to comment on this). The AP Euro curriculum does include discussions of Marxism, and some materials for teachers do suggest that students read the Communist Manifesto. The College Board could be criticized for having a narrow view of US history (among other things), but I don't think that they are worried that students aren't capable of learning about Marxism or entertaining Marx's ideas.\",\n",
       " 'The founders were quite aware of their hypocrisy: it bothered some quite a lot- Franklin was bothered enough to free his slaves and agitate for the general abolition of slavery. Jefferson fully admitted slavery was an evil , but it was convenient to his lifestyle. Washington had little qualms about using slaves until later in his life, when he expressed doubts, and his will freed a good number. Of all the Founder slaveowners, Monroe was perhaps more typical of the general attitude: slavery is bad but useful. One day we\\'ll figure out a way to get rid of it, but not now. Monroe was in favor of abolition in theory- but he would not free any of his slaves, and he had his secretary at his elbow, begging him to do just that. I think \"hypocrisy\" fits well enough. This thing was written by lawyers ( or would-be lawyers) to purpose, and this pivoting from an uncomfortable fact( Founders hypocrisy) to a distracting theory ( the charge has done enormous damage) happens a good bit, like you would expect in a trial. You can wander through it and find many things to laugh at, places where your jaw drops... but I especially admire this bit of courtroom sleight-of-hand . After devoting quite a lot of space to the GOOD things the Founders said or did about slavery, how it wasn\\'t that bad, we stumble into a mention of: the Civil War! This conflict was resolved, but at a cost of more than 600,000 lives. Constitutional amendments were passed to abolish slavery, grant equal protection under the law, and guarantee the right to vote regardless of race. Yet the damage done by the denial of core American principles and by the attempted substitution of a theory of group rights in their place proved widespread and long-lasting. These, indeed, are the direct ancestors of some of the destructive theories that today divide our people and tear at the fabric of our country Pause at \"regardless of race\", and think. Were any of those amendments enforced? Did Black people then step forward as full citizens endowed with life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and the vote? No; we know that Reconstruction was abandoned and Blacks would not have rights fully equal to Whites for more than 100 years. You would think that 100 years of things like lynchings , burnings, and oppression would merit a description...but they would run counter to the happy narrative. So, the authors deftly step away from what would be glaring examples of racism and bad faith and go all theoretical: instead of racism, there\\'s \" denial of core American principles and by the attempted substitution of a theory of group rights\". Theory of group rights?.....Well, those could be had by anybody ....especially, now, all those Black people. They keep thinking about their group rights, and so that\\'s bad.... ( Congratulations, counsel! You have succeeded in diverting everyone from learning about 100 years of real racist violence and oppression, and instead you now have the audience ready to hear that people who identify as Black are tearing at the fabric of our country. ) The authors are not doing history: they are arguing a case against the recent 1619 Project. Now, the 1619 Project should not be above criticism, but this does a terrible job of that- there\\'s no discussion of other points of view, historiography, current scholarship. There is instead a constant threat: the people who disagree with us are doing enormous damage. But these lawyers have no need to actually DO history, because these lawyers are arguing to a conservative jury itching to convict, not to historians. Their audience will be quite content to believe their happy and very convenient little narrative. To me, it\\'s hard to say which is more sad, that the government would sponsor this hack job of political ingratiation, or that too many people will be delighted to read it as fact, and then be willing to say; if you disagree with me, you will be doing enormous damage to this country.',\n",
       " \"On the contrary, it is commonly assumed that much of the tin used in the ancient Near East came from Afghanistan via overland trade. The Old Assyrian texts from Anatolia are explicit about tin being imported from Assyria via donkey caravans (which in turn imported it from further east), and the close association between lapis lazuli and tin in administrative and economic texts from trade hubs like Ebla likewise suggests that much (if not all) of the tin used in Anatolia and Mesopotamia came from Afghanistan. Additionally, at least some tin was mined locally. For example, the Early Bronze Age Kestel tin mine was discovered in Turkey only about 30 years ago and suggests there's still a lot we don't know about early tin sources. Although there has been much hubbub about a recent study indicating tin came from Cornwall, there are two issues with this study: Virtually all of the ingots tested in the study came from shipwrecks in the eastern Mediterranean, with the exception of those found at Mochlos (an island off Crete), and thus the results are overwhelmingly skewed toward tin transported via ships in the Mediterranean. The study focuses specifically on the Late Bronze Age, and we should be cautious about assuming that Cornwall was a significant source of tin in the Early and Middle Bronze Age.

       " \"Ahh, the historiography around Alexander III of Macedon. What a complete mess. We can, by and large, split the tradition surrounding Alexander into a few main categories: 1. Source material contemporary to Alexander such as epigraphy, the Babylonian temple records, and numismatic (coin) evidence; 2. Scattered references in later textual sources, largely works of geography concerning areas of Alexander's activity; 3. Later narratives based on the 'official', pro-Alexander sources, notably those of Aristoboulos and Ptolemy (yes, that Ptolemy, first Macedonian king of Egypt); 4. Later narratives based on a more hostile, largely southern Greek source tradition known as the 'Vulgate', principally the work of Kleitarchos; 5. Romantic narratives that may have some basis in the historical sources, but largely tell a fantastical version of Alexander's life. While you may think that the contemporary material is of great help, sorry but not really. The epigraphic evidence contemporary to Alexander is not particularly extensive, and confined mainly to Greek cities in Asia Minor and of course Greece proper. While it tells us quite a bit about specific relations between Alexander and the cities, it doesn't say much about his broader pattern of activities, especially outside the Greek context. Moreover, there is a certain survival bias in these sources, as ultimately, Alexander's conquests proved to be a key moment in the history of the cities of Asia Minor, as opposed to a temporary interruption of Achaemenid rule, which they might have been seen as when they first took place. As such, we have surviving records of good relations between the cities and Alexander, but not, for instance, of defections back to Persia once Alexander had gone off somewhere else. The one example of a surviving hostile account of Alexander's activities is a speech from around 333 called On the Treaty with Alexander, attributed erroneously to the Athenian orator Demosthenes by compilers. The Babylonian Astronomical Diaries, inscribed on clay tablets, offer a literally fragmentary record of Alexander's activities in relation to Babylon, but the principal events recorded within, at least on the surviving portions, are the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 and Alexander's subsequent capture of the city, and Alexander's death in 323. And then there are coins. Coins don't lie, but they also don't say anything on their own. The implications of changes in iconography, patterns of distribution, levels of production and so on must be argued by numismatists, usually with reference to the textual material establishing context for numismatic material. Much the same goes for the geographical works like Strabo's Geography and Pausanias' Description of Greece, which record some local anecdotes about Alexander, but these are few and far between. As above, they represent local traditions around Alexander with a particular survival bias generally favouring pro-Alexander stories. This means that it is largely textual narrative accounts that we rely on, and none of them are contemporary to Alexander. Plutarch and Arrian, the two surviving authors of the 'official' tradition, had very similar backgrounds: both were Greeks (Plutarch from Chaironeia near Thebes and Arrian from Nikomedia in northwest Anatolia) who became Roman citizens, and both were active in the early 2nd century AD under the Nerva-Antonine emperors – Plutarch mainly under Trajan and Arrian mainly under Hadrian. Both had connections in high Roman society, with Plutarch's citizenship sponsored by an ex-consul, while Arrian in fact was appointed not only to the senate but also the consulship by Hadrian, and served as governor of Cappadocia for six years. For both of these men, operating in the circles of ambitious emperors with eastward-facing ambitions, and from regions shaped by Alexander's campaigns (Plutarch's hometown was the site of Alexander's first battle in 338), Alexander and his legacy were particularly pertinent. Plutarch's works are broadly divided into two corpuses: the Lives, a collection of biographies; and the Moralia, a broad-brush term to describe a large collection of texts focussed mainly, but not exclusively, on philosophy and practical ethics. The Lives of Greeks (and Macedonians and Thracians) and Romans were intended as moral exemplars, and while modern compilations tend to group these Lives chronologically, Plutarch's Lives were originally composed as a pair of one Greek and one Roman, with Plutarch highlighting the common aspects of the two. Naturally, Plutarch wrote an extensive Life of Alexander, paired with that of Julius Caesar. Besides this, however, he also composed two orations under the title On the Fortune or Virtue of Alexander, which are non-chronological accounts but which help to explain much of his methodology for the Life of Alexander. The key takeaways are that firstly, Plutarch was very familiar with the contemporary source material as some half a dozen sources are cited in the orations; secondly, Plutarch saw Alexander as the vanguard of 'Hellenisation', the spread of Greek culture throughout the world; and thirdly, Plutarch saw Alexander as a largely positive exemplar whose activities were a net good. These seriously impact how we ought to view the Life. On the one hand, any conclusion or statement that Plutarch makes was likely done with a careful consideration of a variety of then-extant source material, but on the other hand, his interpretation leans in favour of seeing Alexander as a Greek hero, and so he draws together specifically pro-Alexander anecdotes and episodes from a wide variety of disconnected sources. Moreover, the way that Plutarch composed the Lives should also give some pause: his purpose was to illustrate a relatively internally consistent character archetype which would, crucially, also apply to his Roman comparison, not to give a perfect account of events. As Plutarch himself says at the start of the Life of Alexander, he is writing Lives, not histories. For Plutarch, Alexander and Caesar were comparable as exemplars of Greek and Roman virtue, but who were ultimately consumed and fatally destroyed by ambition. In short, Plutarch's account is the best-sourced account, but also the one that takes the most liberties with those sources. That does not make it folklore, because while he is spinning his own tale, it is a tale rooted in the sources, and there are moments were he fully admits how there is incontrovertible evidence of Alexander doing something that doesn't fit his idealised portrait. Arrian, whose Anabasis of Alexander is the most complete and comprehensive surviving narrative source, used to be regarded as our most reliable source for Alexander, largely as the result of the work of W. W. Tarn in the early 20th century. Recent decades, however, have seen significant pushback on that view, due in no small part to interrogating some very obvious methodological statements made by Arrian. Unlike Plutarch, Arrian declared that he was mostly using two sources – the account of Aristoboulos (which seems to have been one of Plutarch's chief sources), and crucially that of Ptolemy, Alexander's general who became king of Egypt after his death. In his preface, Arrian declares that because Ptolemy was a king, it would be dishonourable for him to lie, and so he goes on to generally resolve any conflicts between his two sources in favour of Ptolemy. As a result, many sections of Arrian are uncritical regurgitations of Ptolemaic propaganda. In addition, early in Book 1, Arrian digresses to explain his motives: to make a long story short, he felt as though the glorious deeds of Alexander had not yet been matched with equally glorious prose (i.e. an account in Attic Greek). Arrian was to be to Alexander what Homer was to Achilles. He also wished to emulate Xenophon, whose Anabasis recounting his campaigns in Persia was one of the most-read Greek works in the classical world, and which provided the title to Arrian's own work on Alexander. As such, it is possible to be very cynical about Arrian and say that he wrote the Anabasis intending to write a flattering portrait, and so picked two of the most flattering sources, and blatantly favoured the more flattering of the two. He also likely engages in more than a little touching up beyond what even Ptolemy is likely to have written: in particular, in his final reckoning of Alexander's character in Book 7, he rather boldly claims that Alexander drank only in moderation and in the company of friends, something which would certainly have been news to the man himself! Arrian's account is thus at many points deeply questionable in terms of its specifics. However, it is certainly by no means fiction as a whole, and gives a chronologically clear accounting of Alexander's movements and activities.\",\n",
       " 'We have quite a few pre-industrial texts that contain routine mentions of child labor. For one of the best known: The child grew up. One day, he went out to his father among the reapers. Suddenly he cried to his father, “Oh, my head, my head!” He said to a servant, “Carry him to his mother.” He picked him up and brought him to his mother. And the child sat on her lap until noon; and he died. Then Samuel asked Jesse, “Are these all the boys you have?” He replied, “There is still the youngest; he is tending the flock.” And Samuel said to Jesse, “Send someone to bring him, for we will not sit down to eat until he gets here.” But Saul said to David, “You cannot go to that Philistine and fight him; you are only a boy, and he has been a warrior from his youth!” David replied to Saul, “Your servant has been tending his father’s sheep, and if a lion or a bear came and carried off an animal from the flock, I would go after it and fight it and rescue it from its mouth. And if it attacked me, I would seize it by the beard and strike it down and kill it. Your servant has killed both lion and bear; and that uncircumcised Philistine shall end up like one of them, for he has defied the ranks of the living God. This was actually David admitting that he goes the extra mile, as hired shepherds were not required to fight off predators, but here we have a child (probably an early adolescent) casually noting that he had a job where he killed a bear. This would not have been included if children his age never worked as shepherds in pre-industrial society.',\n",

       " 'The simplest weapons, such as the spear (including the javelin), the club, the thrown stone, are all simple enough to have easily been invented multiple times. They are also exceedingly ancient inventions. Spears have been used for at least a few hundred thousand years, and probably much longer. Observation of chimpanzees making and hunting with spears: Pruetz J. D., Bertolani P., Ontl K. Boyer, Lindshield S., Shelley M. and Wessling E. G., , \"New evidence on the tool-assisted hunting exhibited by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in a savannah habitat at Fongoli, Sénégal\", R. Soc. open sci. 2, 140507. http://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.140507 suggests that they might have been used by the common ancestors of chimpanzees and humans. Noting that no other chimpanzee groups have been observed hunting with spears, it\\'s likely that this observed use is itself an independent re-invention of the spear. Clubs are used much more widely by chimpanzees, and also the throwing of objects. For more complex weapons such as the bow, the sling, and the spearthrower, we don\\'t know. They are all very old, very prehistoric inventions. Since they are made (mostly) of wood and fibre, they survive quite poorly, and their early history is mysterious. If the bow was invented at about the time that the oldest surviving fragments date to (about 10,000 years ago), then the bow was certainly invented multiple times, with at least two independent inventions (the Old World and the Americas), and probably more. With the earliest dates for which we have evidence (about 65,000 years ago), in the form of projectile points which, if made in the last few thousand years, would have been identified as arrowheads, the bow might have been invented once, and spread. Even with this early invention, it might have been invented multiple times. One version of the bow, the wood-horn-sinew reflex-recurve composite bow has two independent inventions, one in Central Asia probably about 4,000 years ago, and the other in America. The crossbow might have multiple inventions (possibly in eastern Asia, Western Asia or Europe, and Africa), or possibly just a single invention - the early development and diffusion of the crossbow (as a hunting weapon rather than a military weapon) is almost unknown. The development of powerful military crossbows occurred multiple times, at least twice, in East Asia and Europe. Metal daggers or short swords have been invented at least twice, possibly many times. There was at least one Old World invention and at least one American invention (and probably at least two American inventions, one in the Pacific NW, and once in the Andes, and possibly also Mesoamerica). Similarly, metal axes have at least two separate inventions, at least once in the Old World and at least once in the Americas. In summary, we don\\'t know whether bows (in general), axes (in general, including stone axes), and spears were invented multiple times. Spears are simple enough to have been easily invented multiple times, but we don\\'t know if they were. Later developments, such as military crossbows, composite bows, metal daggers/swords and metal axes, were invented independently multiple times.',\n",
       " 'You kind of walk straight past the point in your post: Why the ideology driven, nationalistic, racist, militaristic desire for empire, when all they really needed was oil? Quite simply, there was far more than oil at stake, which is why there was so much more a drive for empire, even when oil was theoretically available on the open market. I am not going to comment on Germany, as that is well outside my area of expertise. However, in Japan\\'s case, the issue was not about oil alone. Japan\\'s expansion and desire for empire was not solely about oil, but rather, oil was a small portion of a much more deep set goal for the Empire. Indeed, at the time of the oil embargo, the oil cut off was not at the absolute forefront of Japanese policy maker\\'s minds. For quite some time before, the US had been seeking out ways to reduce oil exports to Japan, without resorting to a full embargo, via various export restrictions related to the US\\'s own military build up. Of equal or greater concern was the steady closing off of export options for machine tools, chemicals, specialty alloys, and other such goods from the US, as well as the asset freeze, which crippled Japan\\'s ability to acquire further resources on the international market (what little of an international market that was left, given the war in Europe). However, all of this is ultimately secondary, because while the asset freeze and full oil embargo may well have been the final straw that convinced Japanese leadership that the Southern Advance was their only option, it was only in place because of Japan\\'s own continued aggressive warring throughout the 1930s and into the 40s. It cannot be overstated how much of a presence the War in China had for Japanese policy making. Ultimately, it was the inability of Japan and the US to come to an understanding over China that led to the increasing economic pressure placed on Japan by the US in an effort to limit further Japanese aggression, which in turn led Japan to striking South, and going to war with the West. Yet how did we get to the War in China? It was not a war that many Japanese policy makers wanted. In the aftermath of World War I, the lesson Japan took away was that any future war would be a total war. Prior to World War I, Japanese war planning tended to assume that--whoever Japan was fighting--there would be neutral powers available for trade and loans in order to provide both the resources and financing that Japan lacked domestically. Moreover, the war would likely be short, completed while Japan had reserves of resources to rely upon. Yet, World War I had seen what was arguably the world\\'s preeminent industrial power, Germany, completely cut off from wider international markets, and forced to slowly wither away, its advanced industrial base starved of resources over a long, attritional war. How to deal with this threat would form the core of Japanese foreign and even domestic policy throughout the interwar period, and the proposed solution was autarky: a Japan that would not be vulnerable to interruption of international trade, and could support a full war economy on its own resources. In the late 1920s, the Cabinet Resources Bureau conducted a series of studies and exercises to develop a full scale mobilisation plan, that would determine what wartime demand for resources would be, and how Japan could meet those demands. While the plan was never fully drafted (its calculations would be thrown off by the Mukden Incident in 1931), early studies had shown that if Japan was to support a war economy, it could not limit itself to domestic resources in Home Islands and Korea. Access to additional resources would have to be acquired, and nearby Manchuria was the first goal. Manchurian iron deposits could become desperately needed steel, while coal deposits offered the prospect of synthetic oil for the Navy. While the Japanese had long had a strategic interest in Manchuria, seeing it as vital to securing their continental flank against Russia, the need for resources deepened the interest in controlling Manchuria economically, not just the strategically key railways. As Chiang Kai-Shek\\'s efforts to unify China under the Kuomintang banner came closer to fruition, and it became clear that he would not be willing to grant Japan the economic concessions in Manchuria they desired, the Kwantung Army took matters into its own hands, and occupied Manchuria on its own authority. The occupation of Manchuria, in turn, sparked Japanese interest in northern China as a whole, both to secure their new critical resource base in the puppet state of Manchukuo, but also for further sources of potential resources. To this end, the Army supported efforts to create either a wholly independent northern Chinese state that would be susceptible to Japanese domination, or at least an autonomous north with substantial economic concessions. This led to a continued intermingling of Japanese and local Chinese forces, while heavy handed Japanese rule increased Chinese distaste for Japan, while the Army\\'s typical response strategy of massive response to every threat to \"show strength\" laid the groundwork for a minor skirmish at the Marco Polo bridge in 1937 to escalate into a full scale war. In its efforts to \"bring an end to the war\", the Japanese often sought to expand it, committing more troops to the ongoing struggle in the north, landing an invasion force at Shanghai, and eventually the occupation of Indochina, all to try and \"end the war\". An interesting note throughout this whole process was how those total war planners in Japan were constant advocates for maintaining peace with the West. These total war planners sought to try and stabilize the situation in China, both to secure Manchukuo\\'s southern flank in the even of war with the Soviet Union, but also to prevent a war that would drain resources at the same time as Japan was seeking to build up its industrial base.The US in particular was a critical source for technology, capital goods, and other necessary materials to establish an expanded Japanese industrial base that could support an autarkic total war economy, and development of economic concessions in northern China could be a vital resource for further economic development. To go to war with China held the potential to completely derail Japanese development plans, if the war dragged on. And drag on it did. The war in China thus presented an almost insurmountable quagmire for Japan. The Army would not countenance withdrawal, arguing that this would be showing weakness that would only lead to future incursions. It was also draining the Japanese economy, as resources meant for further industrial build up were pulled into more immediate needs for supplying the War in China, and the United States became increasingly hostile. Moreover, the outbreak of the war in Europe in 1939 further worsened the situation, as prices for key materiel vital to war industries increased due to European demand, and the United States tightened up its export control regime to retain resources for its own military buildup. Simultaneously, the US wished to place economic pressure on Japan, hoping that such pressure would lead to a restoration of more moderate civilian leaders, rather than militarists, with whom the US could then negotiate with. Japanese demands for an almost exclusive economic zone in China, including recognition of Manchukuo were incompatible with US goals of maintaining the Open Door policy, and this incompatibility proved an immovable stumbling block in the continued US-Japanese negotiations that would ultimately culminate in the attack on Pearl Harbor. So, to sum up, it\\'s incredibly reductive to analyse Japanese policy in the 1920s and 30s as solely about oil. While economic and resource concerns loomed large in the mind of Japanese policy makers, it was not the only issue at stake. This analysis has focused primarily on physical resources and military policy, but issues of currency reserves, balances of trade, Japanese exports, as well as an incredibly important cultural aspect all played a part in shaping Imperial Japanese policy in the lead up to the outbreak of World War II. To say that it was all about oil is extremely reductive, focusing only one part at the very tail end of an extremely long story. I hope this has helped answer your question.

       " '&#x200B; Do we have any sense of what nationality Charles would have considered himself? Is this even a fair question to ask, or is the idea of identifying as a particular nationality too anachronistic and modern a concept to be applied to the early 1500s? Generally speaking the concept of nationhood as understood today, was still largely alien at the beginning of the Early Modern Period. Which isn\\'t to say, that people were oblivious to similarities found among them. Already centuries before the 16th century, medieval writers made observations of similar languages, cuisine customs and traditions among the various regions of Europe and many European universities would group their students into so called \"nationes\" based on a similar language or origin from a common region. However, the idea of truly forming one, more or less clearly defined nation, and the accompanying us vs. them mentality would not have yet formed in most of Europe. There were exceptions, the English are often cited as particularly early to emerge; by some accounts prior to the 14th century and the Dutch, Portuguese and French are also on the early side when it comes to forming a national identity; but on the whole, vast swathes of Europe (Spain, Germany, Scandinavia, the Slavic Balkans and Italy) would remain quite ambiguous when concerning supra-regional identities well into the 18th and 19th century. In any case, nationalism was largely reserved to the emerging bourgeoisie. The nobility, and the Habsburgs are possibly the most obvious example of this, were far more internationally oriented. They valued class and status over nationality/ethnicity and would continue to do so, especially the high nobility and royalty, basically up until the First World War. For most of the princes, kings and emperors of Europe, assigning them to a single ethnicity is pointless. Nevertheless, many of the late 18th and 19th century \\'historians\\' did just that. Louis II, King of East Francia suddenly became \"Louis the German\" and fierce attempts were made by both French and the German nationalists to claim figures like Charlemagne; which make no sense whatsoever from an objective historical point of view. The closest to something akin to a modern ethnic or national identity you\\'re going to get with Charles V will focus on where he spend most of his days as well as first language: Charles V spoke only two languages fluently: French and Dutch. Speaking Dutch is extremely helpful when in the Low Countries, but mostly useless outside of this particular region. French on the other hand, was not only one of his native languages, it was also the international language of diplomacy and the aristocracy. Combined, this would have made it his \\'mother tongue\\' for all intends and purposes. As for his \\'homeland\\' if you will, overall it was clearly in the Low Countries; where he spend most of his life by some measure. Nevertheless,we should be careful to assume a special, loving relationship here. Ghent, the city in which he was born and spend his childhood, was heavily taxed by Charles V to the point where it rebelled against him and he had to besiege the city. On the other had, he clearly had close and trusting connections to many Dutch nobility and clergy (best exemplified by Adriaan Boeyens, who he first made regent of Spain and then Pope) and the lack of affection for and understanding of the Low Countries of his successor Philip II was to be one of the main catalysts for the Dutch Revolt some mere 8 years after his death. So in summary: it\\'s an interesting but ultimately unanswerable question; but in all likelihood he would have identified more with the French and Dutch than with the Spanish or Germans. To what specific degree?

The lower the frequency of radio transmissions, the longer an aerial needs to be to receive them; the logical location for a long wire aerial on an aircraft is from a mast behind (or even in front of) the cockpit stretching to the top of the vertical stabiliser. With higher frequency transmissions, shorter aerials can be used; early Supermarine Spitfires and Hawker Hurricanes used the TR9 High Frequency (HF) radio and had a wire strung from mast to tail. Once the Very High Frequency (VHF) TR.1133 set was introduced the aerial mast behind the cockpit alone was sufficient, so there was no need for the wire aerial. Spitfires and Hurricanes could also have wires emerging from the fuselage to the tips of the tailplane for early Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) sets, though again these were superseded by improved designs working at higher frequencies that only needed short underwing aerials. See The Spitfire Site for an illustrated article outlining the various masts and aerials, or the Tailhook Topics blog for an extensive piece on F4U Corsair aerials or a more general overview or carrier aircraft aerials.\",\n",
       " 'It seems you are asking about the background and reasons of anti-Jewish and/or anti-Semitic sentiment throughout history. Posts of this type are common on the subreddit, so we have this reply which is intended as a general response that provides an overview of the history of anti-Semitic thought and action. The essential point that needs to be emphasized: the reason for anti-Jewish hatred and persecution has absolutely nothing to do with things Jewish men and women did, said or thought. Religious and racial persecution is not the fault of the victim but of the persecutor and anti-Semitism, like all prejudices, is inherently irrational. Framing history in a manner that places the reason for racial hatred with its victims is a technique frequently employed by racists to justify their hateful ideology. The reasons why Jews specifically were persecuted, expelled, and discriminated against throughout mainly European history can vary greatly depending on time and place, but there are overarching historical factors that can help us understand the historical persecution of Jews - mainly that they often were the only minority available to scapegoat. Christian majority societies as early as the Roman empire had an often strained and complicated relationship with the Jewish population that lived within their borders. Christian leaders instituted a policy that simultaneously included grudging permissions for Jews to live in certain areas and practice their faith under certain circumstances but at the same time subjected them to discriminatory measures such as restrictions where they could live and what professions they could practice. The Christian Churches – Catholic, Orthodox, and later Protestant – also begrudgingly viewed the Jews as the people of the Old Testament but used their dominant roles in society to make the Jewish population the target of intense proselytization and other them further by preaching their fault for the death of Jesus. This dynamic meant that Jews were the most easily recognisable and visible minority to point fingers at during a crisis. This can be best observed with the frequent accusations of \"blood libel\" – an anti-Semitic canard alleging that Jews murdered Christian children to use their blood in religious rituals – in situations where Christian children or adults disappeared, the communal panic immediately channeling itself as Jew-hatred with tragic results. Similarly, religious, ideological, and economic reasons were often interwoven in the expulsion of Jews to whom medieval rulers and kings owed a lot of money; in fact, one intersection of crisis-blaming and financial motive occurred during the Black Death, when local rulers were able to cynically blame Jews for the plague as an excuse for murdering and expelling them. These processes also often took place within negotiations between social and political elites over state formation. One of the best examples is the expulsion of the Jewish population from Spain by the rulers of Castile and Aragon after the Reconquista in 1491. Expulsion and forcible conversions progressed toward an institutionalized suspicion towards so-called New Christians – Jews who’d recently converted– based on their \"blood\". This was an unprecedented element in antisemitic attitudes that some scholars place within the context of Spanish rulers and nobility becoming engaged in a rather brutal state formation process. In order to define themselves, they chose to define and get rid of a group they painted as alien, foreign and different in a negative way – as the \"other\". Once again Jews were the easily available minority. Jews long remained in this position of only available religious minority, and over time they were often made very visible as such: discriminatory measures introduced very early on included being forced to wear certain hats and clothing, be part of humiliating rituals, pay onerous taxes, live in restricted areas of towns – ghettos – and be separated from the majority population. All this further increased the sense of “other-ness” that majority societies experienced toward the Jews. They were made into the other by such measures. This continued with the advent of modernity, especially in the context of nationalism. The 19th century is marked by a huge shift in ways to explain the world, especially in regards to factors such as nationalism, race, and science. To break it down to the essentials: the French Revolution and its aftermath delegitimized previously established explanations for why the world was the way it was – a new paradigm of “rationalism” took hold. People would now seek to explain differences in social organizations and ways of living between the various peoples of the world with this new paradigm. Out of this endeavour to explain why people were different soon emerged what we today understand as modern racism, meaning not just theories on why people are different but constructing a dichotomy of worth out of these differences. A shift took place from a religious othering to one based more on nationality - and thereby, in the minds of many, on race. In the tradition of völkisch thought, as formulated by thinkers such as Gobineau and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, races as the main historical actors were seen as acting through the nation. Nations were their tool or outlet to take part in Social Darwinist competition between the races. The Jews were seen as a race without a nation - as their own race, which dates back to them being imperial subjects and older stereotypes of them as \"the other\" - and therefore acting internationally rather than nationally. Seen through this nationalistic lens, an individual Jew living in Germany, for example, was not seen as German but was seen as having no nation. For such Jews, this meant that the Jewish emancipation that Enlightenment brought provided unprecedented freedom and removed many of the barriers that they had previously experienced, the advent of scientific racism and volkisch thought meant that new barriers and prejudices simply replaced them. Racist thinkers of the 19th century augmented these new barriers and prejudices with conspiratorial thinking. The best example for this anti-Semitic delusion are the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a fake political treatise produced by the Tsarist Secret Police at some point in 1904/05 which pretends to be the minutes of a meeting of the leaders of a Jewish world conspiracy discussing plans to get rid of all the world\\'s nations and take over the world. While the Protocols were quickly debunked as a forgery, they had a huge impact on many anti-Semitic and völkisch thinkers in Europe, including some whose writings were most likely read by the young Hitler. The whole trope of the Jewish conspiracy as formulated by völkisch thought took on a whole new importance in the late 1910s, with the end of WWI, the Bolshevik revolution, and subsequent attempts at communist revolution in Germany and elsewhere. Jews during the 19th century had often embraced ideologies such as (classical) liberalism and communism, because they hoped these ideologies would propagate a world in which it didn’t matter whether you were a Jew or not. However, the idea of Jews being a driving force behind communism was clearly designed by Tsarist secret police and various racists in the Russian Empire as a way to discredit communism as an ideology. This trope of Jews being the main instigators behind communism and Bolshevism subsequently spread from the remnants of Tsarist Russia over the central powers all the way to Western Europe. This delusion of an internationalist conspiracy would finally result in the Nazis’ Holocaust killing vast numbers of Jews and those made Jews by the Nazi’s racial laws. While this form of anti-Semitism lost some of its mass appeal in the years after 1945, forms of it still live on, mostly in the charge of conspiracy so central to the modern form of anti-Semitism: from instances such as the Moscow doctors’ trial, to prevalent discourses about Jews belonging to no nation, to discourses related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to the recent surges of anti-Semitic violence in various states – anti-Semitism didn’t disappear after the end of the Holocaust. Even the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the conspiratorial pamphlet debunked soon after it was written at the beginning of the 20th century, has been consistently in print throughout the world ever since. Again, anti-Jewish persecution has never been caused by something the Jews did, said, or thought. It was and is caused by the hatred, delusions, and irrational prejudices harbored by those who carried out said persecution. After centuries of standing out due to religious and alleged racial difference, without defenders and prevented from defending themselves, Jews stood out as almost an ideal “other.” Whether the immediate cause at various points has been religious difference, conspiracy theory, ancestral memory of hatred, or simply obvious difference, Jews were and continue to be targeted by those who adhere to ideologies of hatred.

       " 'Finland\\'s offensive in the Continuation War not only recaptured the territory lost as a result of the Winter War, but also pushed well beyond the old border into Soviet territory. The Soviet offensive stage at the end of the Continuation War recaptured a lot of these Finnish gains, especially in the Karelian Isthmus and the area between Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega. Further north, the front line was still well into Soviet territory. The final stages of the Soviet offensive, consisting of Finnish defensive victories, resulted in a peace agreement with the front lines mostly in either the territory lost by Finland in the Winter War, or Soviet territory. For a map of the front lines at the end, see https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Continuation_War_September_1944_English.jpg The dark grey dots show the post-Winter War border, and the lighter grey dots the pre-Winter War Border. For a map showing the maximum extent of the Finnish advance into the Soviet Union, see https://twitter.com/MapsAndFlags/status/613423896583401473 The peace at the end of the Continuation War restored the post-Winter War border in Karelia and Salla, and also ceded Petsamo to the Soviet Union (thus, Finland lost its Arctic Ocean border): https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Finnish_areas_ceded_in_1944.png The Soviet Union was committed to, at minimum, at least restoring the post-Winter War border - Finland was not going to gain territory from the Continuation War. In the end, they also gained Petsamo (valuable for its minerals, more that the territory in general). What is unknown is whether the Soviets had greater territorial ambitions, possibly to conquer all of Finland. This was denied by the Soviet government, which claimed (afterwards) that the final offensive was just intended to force Finland to accept their peace offer, rather than to conquer Finland. A common Finnish claim is that the final offensives were intended to conquer Finland, with intent to incorporate Finland into the Soviet Union, and that the Soviet claims of lesser goals are face-saving. Since the pre-Winter War plan was to make Finland a puppet state (thus, the establishment and recognition of the Kuusinen \"government\"), it is quite believable that the Soviets aimed for the same goal in the Continuation War, but were willing to accept lesser outcomes. The truth is not known, and both extreme viewpoints are possible.

       " 'Safe houses, storage facilities, people sympathetic enough to the cause playing their parts at various points - but more than anything, either economic or geopolitical support from benefactors. Don’t discount greed - war is a great economic stimulus to encourage the profit motive. High sustained volumes of low-input consumables like food, ammo, water, basic supplies, and durable goods that get blown up and need to be replaced (weapons systems, vehicles, logistics equipment). They get what they need hidden in local economic activity. The only thing that truly stops a guerilla insurrection is total scorched earth and depopulation of the disputed area, so that no economy really exists, certainly not one that can support hidden transfers of materiel. Even that takes time for a well-stocked insurgency in challenging terrain, if they already have their men in place. Guerrillas can’t replace or manufacture vital supplies themselves, but the profit motive for local players is a powerful thing. The Viet Cong’s utilization of the HCM trail, like other hard terrain combat zones, aided the longest part of the journey from distribution points, harbours and rail depots in the north to the supply points that the infiltrators used to take it the ‘last mile’ to where it would be used, but they also lived off the infrastructure and purchased/stole supplies inside Sourh Vietnam as well, with well funded benefactors in China and USSR. Had political and public will allowed it, the US would have had to invade North Vietnam and utterly destroy or occupy the input points for the Soviet and Chinese air, rail and sea supply points. That becomes an occupation nightmare, again unless you’re ruthless enough to force millions of people out of the urban distribution points that can process the volumes of stuff required to make an insurgent army go. Once the stuff gets off the dock, out of the warehouse or unloaded from the rail cars - forget it. You’re never going to catch enough to move the needle if you don’t control the ground closest to those distribution points. The world is really damn big and armies are smaller than the populations they move through. That intensity of total societal destruction warfare is not really tolerated since the second half of the 20th century. Thus, guerrilla movements can operate within the normal profit motivated markets they’re fighting in. Many players in the supply chains will of course not even be aware or be willfully blind to their part in supplying insurgents. Money is money and war is good business. It makes legendary fortunes.',\n",
       " \"I haven't studied him enough to give a grand summary of his achievements/biography here, but here's a bit about Louis XI of France. He was also known as the 'universal spider', he was mostly the poster child for Machiavellianism and had his hands in every political pie he could find. Varys the Spider in Game of Thrones was apparently partially based off this king. Louis perpetually wanted more land, power, and money. He involved himself in the wars of others and instigated his own wars, he had a network of spies, he never met an alliance he was afraid to betray. On the other hand for his people, he wanted a well-ordered and prosperous kingdom, with good economic policies and reputation. Louis had a cameo in the War of the Roses. He was cousin to Margaret of Anjou, wife of Henry VI, and he harbored Jasper Tudor and the Earl of Warwick in his court at different points. Eventually Edward VI took the English throne, was cross at Louis, but Louis sweet-talked him into a peace treaty and was apparently rather smug about it. Other nicknames included Louis the Cunning and Louis the Prudent. He also created, albeit partially for his benefit, the groundwork for the future French postal system.

       " 'You\\'ve hit upon a very important point! Indeed, availability of merchant shipping was a critical issue for Japan at the outbreak of war in Europe. Even during the War in China, military demands on Japanese merchant shipping had been extremely detrimental, with shortages becoming commonplace, and impeding the normal functioning of the Japanese domestic economy. By mid-November 1940, the Japanese domestic economy was already operating with only 75% of the shipping deemed to be the absolute minimum necessary to maintain the economy. Shipping shortages would go on to plague Japan throughout the war, even before the American submarine blockade began devastating what merchant shipping the Japanese did have, and would prevent Japan from ever fully digesting or integrating the resources it went to war to acquire. But let\\'s zoom out a bit. At the time of the outbreak of war between Japan, the US, and the UK in 1941, the Japanese merchant marine consisted of about 6.7 million tons of shipping, and Japanese estimates budgeted a minimum of 3 million tons of shipping in order to sustain the civilian economy. Yet, even so, about 30% of Japanese trade was carried on foreign flagged vessels, which only increased the stress carried on the increasingly limited Japanese merchant shipping, even assuming no war time losses. Issues of shipping were indeed a major concern for Japanese policy makers and warplanners, as the need for merchant shipping to be shuttled around between military and civilian used imposed stricter timetables on Japanese operations than they may have liked, as the same transports being used to carry troops south would have to be returned to the domestic economy. Allocation of shipping resources between Army, Navy, and civilian use would be a major sticking point throughout the war. As an example, at the outbreak of the war, the Army and Navy combined had commandeered 4 million tons of shipping to support initial operations (you will note that this leaves a mere 2.7 million tons for civilian use, less than the 3 million estimate required to sustain the economy). The Army pledged to return 1.1 million tons of shipping to civilian use by the end of initial operations over the course of 1942. As the war continued, developing into the Solomon Islands Campaign, the Army demanded additional shipping be allocated to it in order to support operations against Guadalcanal, a request that was rebuffed by the War Ministry and government. The dispute over shipping allocations escalated into a fistfight between the head of the Army General Staff\\'s Operations Department and the head of the War Ministry\\'s Military Affairs Bureau, while also including a shouting match between the former and Prime Minister Tojo the following day. As you can see, to say the issue was contentious is putting it mildly. I am not aware of any American or British shipping commandeered by the Japanese early in the war. For the Americans at least, as part of efforts to reduce oil exports to Japan short of a full embargo, the US government had asked private corporations to redirect American flagged oil tankers from trade with Japan as early as the summer of 1940. Yet, you are correct in pointing out that there would be severe issues in crewing new merchantmen. Quality of merchant crews was a major issue for the Japanese, especially as many of the experienced mariners and seamen who made up the backbone of the merchant marine were also part of the naval reserves, leaving only inexperienced crewmen left to man Japan\\'s merchant shipping. The question then becomes: why? Why was Japan in general and the IJN in particular so unprepared for the mercantile demands of war? In many ways, they had done their best to prepare, but the best Japan could do was simply not enough. Throughout the 1930s, the Japanese government had invested heavily in expanding and modernising Japan\\'s merchant marine via governmental subsidies. The Japanese merchant marine expanded by around 2 million tons from the early 1930s till the outbreak of war, and--due to a premium placed on modern ships--many of these merchant ships were large, efficient, and fast (especially as some were designed for easy conversion into aircraft carriers). At the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Japanese merchant marine was third in the world in terms of size but possibly first in terms of quality. Similarly, the issues of oil were well known. Between 1934 and 1940, Japanese ocean going tanker tonnage went from 120,000 tons to 364,000 tons, and capacity grew from 1 million tons of oil to 4 million, carried by a fleet of tankers that included some of the largest in the world at the time. Impressive as these increases may seem, it simply was not enough for what was being demanded of it. Part of the issue was simple institutional blindfolds in the IJN. As an institution, the IJN prioritsed offensive action and battle above all else. The best officers and men strove to receive combatant commands, and tended to remain there, leaving only officers and men deemed less capable to take up rear area commands. There was no rotation between officers in command of combat units and those tasked with supplying them. In the IJNs naval planning, there was little concern on whether the logistical ability to carry out an operation existed. Rather, it tended to be that the operation was decided upon first, and then logistics commanders would have to find some way of supplying them. Logistics was never the IJNs (or the IJAs) strong suit. In addition to the institutional issues described above, the IJNs grand plan for war with the United States only involved a single campaign culminating in a decisive battle. Thus, logistical concerns would take some time to come into play, as--presumably--by the time questions of shipping commitments or supply lines came to a head, the American fleet would be at the bottom, and a victorious Combined Fleet could return to its home bases. I\\'m afraid I don\\'t have much to add on the Soviet trade aspect of the question. Regardless, I hope this response has helped answer your question, and please feel free to ask any follow ups.

Because as written, the answer is yes, all Indo-European societies share a common \"mythic mama,\" which is sometimes obvious (Thor and Zeus) and sometimes not so obvious.

       " 'Gorgeous George was a very popular wrestler, a kind of Lady Gaga of the wrestling world in the late 1940s, early 1950s. The professional wrestling world in those days. like today\\'s WWE, was a mainly theatrical production. The wrestlers were self-created characters, playing roles in a relatively small number of plotted contests involving much tossing of bodies, heroes and villains, heroic comebacks and noble efforts, etc. My father, like many, was a big fan of this \"sport\" and often took me to matches when I was 8 to 11. Why my mother let him do this, I have no idea. But I thought the matches were real. I rooted for the heroes and against the villains, and watched with dismay when my heroes were \"hurt.\" I remember talking to one of them between matches, worried that he\\'d been hurt by a particularly vicious wristhold. He pluckily assured me that he could continue. Anyhow, in this world of bizarre personalities, Gorgeous George was among the best known. His antics filled the arenas and inspired much shouting and cheering. When wrestling came to TV, c. 1948, many fans bought sets and relaxed on the living room couch, beer in hand, and watch their favorite muscle-bound warriors in combat . Uncle Milty appeared on our tiny screens at about the same time and he had a wildly faithful following, which tells you a lot about the overall quality of TV programming. In these years, I think most TV purchasers were drawn not so much to George or Milty, but to the phenomena of television, remote viewing of distant events. TV watching was often a social affair, with friends or family sharing the experience, in awe and delight. Whether what you saw was good or bad didn\\'t matter much. How you could ever quantify which performer sold more TV sets, I don\\'t know. My father was a furniture dealer and he SOLD TV sets in his store.

       " \"Exterior security for foreign embassies has been the responsibility of the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division (previously called the White House Police Force and Executive Protective Service) since 1970 — though obviously, that mandate doesn't extend onto the embassy property. Security within the embassy itself was the responsibility of the KGB. The KGB's First Chief Directorate, responsible for foreign intelligence, maintained a rezidentura (station) in every Soviet embassy, staffed with intelligence officers under 'legal' cover as Soviet diplomats (as distinct from the 'illegals'; intelligence officers who had no diplomatic cover and did not operate from the embassy.) The First Chief Directorate was a vast service-within-a-service, with dozens of sub-departments. One of these, Line KR (for 'kontrazvietka'/'counterintelligence'), was responsible for internal security: within each overseas rezidentura, Line KR officers were tasked with maintaining the security of the embassy and monitoring all embassy personnel, to prevent either penetration by foreign intelligence services or defections by embassy staff. Line KR's counterintelligence tactics were not strictly defensive — they also conducted operations against foreign intelligence services, to protect KGB operations and assets and identify enemy agents: arguably the two most important agents the KGB ever recruited inside the US, CIA officer Aldrich Ames and FBI agent Robert Hansson were both recruited and handled by Victor Cherkashin, the head of the Line KR detachment at the Washington embassy. Hansson, among other dubious honours, was responsible for alerting the KGB to an ambitious attempt by the FBI and NSA to bug the new Soviet embassy then under construction in Washington, by digging a tunnel under the embassy and packing it with surveillance equipment.

       " 'Three Soviet successor states (other than Russia) inherited stockpiles of Soviet-era nuclear weapons — totalling more than 8,000 weapons — after the collapse of the USSR: Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine. In fact, by size of arsenal, Ukraine was for a time the third-largest nuclear power in the world. It\\'s important to understand at the outset, though, that physical possession of nuclear weapons does not mean you have the ability to use them. Nuclear weapons are invariably governed by sophisticated command-and-control processes, though each country\\'s process is different. The key security measure is usually a \\'Permissive Action Link (PAL): physical and electronic safeguards attached to each weapon that prevent it from being armed without authorisation. Specific details about how PAL systems work are hard to come by, for obvious reasons — technical and operational details about nuclear weapons are about the most closely-guarded state secrets out there, no matter which country you\\'re talking about. (For a good overview of how these safeguards and processes developed over the years — albeit one primarily focused on the US nuclear arsenal — I\\'d recommend Eric Schlosser\\'s Command and Control: Nuclear Weapons, the Damascus Accident, and the Illusion of Safety So, what the three \\'possessor states\\' were left with in 1991 were a large quantity of weapons that they were unable to use; the new Russian Federation, meanwhile, was keen to see those weapons back in its custody. In the Alma-Ata Declaration of December 1991, which completed the dissolution of the USSR and the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the states agreed that all nuclear weapons in the possessor states would be transferred to the Russian Federation by the end of 1994. The agreement also confirmed Russia as the nuclear successor state to the USSR, and reaffirmed Russian command-and-control over all nuclear weapons in the CIS. All three possessor states signed the Lisbon Protocol to the START I Treaty in May 1992, agreeing to join the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and become \\'non-nuclear states\\' in \"the shortest possible time\". Belarus acceded to the NPT in February 1993, and Kazakhstan in February 1994; Ukraine, however, took a more activist approach, seeing an opportunity to leverage its accession to NPT and the return of its nuclear arsenal for assurances regarding the Soviet successor states\\' independence. After prolonged multilateral negotiations, in December 1994 the Russian Federation, United States and United Kingdom issued the Memorandum on Security Assurances (actually, three versions of the memorandum — one each for Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan), pledging among other things to \"respect the Independence and Sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine\". Ukraine acceded to the NPT the same day. The withdrawal of nuclear weapons from all three possessor states was ultimately completed by the end of 1996, though the removal of leftover nuclear material and the decommissioning of old Soviet nuclear sites continued for several more years. The Nuclear Threat Initiative has approximate breakdowns of what weapons were left in each country, and when they were removed, for each of Ukraine Belarus and Kazakhstan A more detailed account of the disarmament process (and the diplomatic wrangling that accompanied it) can be found in Deadly Arsenals: Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Threats',\n",
       " 'There was a major concern over nuclear weapons in other former Soviet states. I just did a quick rundown of how the Soviet dissolution worked, in case anyone is interested in a backgrounder. Specifically around nuclear weapons - at the time of the Soviet dissolution, Soviet strategic nuclear weapons were sited in four of the fifteen republics: Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. So right off the bat, there weren\\'t any Moldovan or Turkmen or Armenian intercontinental nukes in play. Tactical nuclear weapons were apparently in all former republics in mid-1991, but were already being transferred to Russia, with these weapons out of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the Baltics by that fall. About 1,280 tactical warheads were outside Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan by late 1991. Belarus had 81 nuclear ICBMs, (Topol, or known to NATO as SS-25s). Kazakhstan had 1,400 SS-18 ICBMs in 147 launchers, as well as 40 Tu-95 heavy bombers with 320 cruise missiles. Ukraine had the largest arsenal of the three (and thus the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world at the time): 130 SS-19s, each capable of delivering six nuclear weapons, 46 SS-24s, each armed with ten nuclear weapons, plus 14 SS-24 missiles not operationally deployed with warheads, in addition to dozen bombers with strategic nuclear capabilities were armed with some 600 air-launched missiles, along with gravity bombs. A further 3,000 tactical nuclear weapons rounded out an arsenal totaling approximately 5,000 strategic and tactical weapons. Russia itself in late 1991 held about 8,750 strategic nuclear weapons and something like 9,000 tactical nuclear weapons, or about two-thirds of the Soviet nuclear arsenal. This included about 20 ICBM sites, three heavy bomber bases, and all eight ballistic missile submarine facilities. The Soviet military with respect to nuclear weapons operated as follows: the USSR was divided into 16 military districts: 10 were in Russia proper, three in Ukraine, one made up of Belarus and the Baltics, one in Transcaucasia, and one in Central Asia. Tactical nuclear weapons would be held in one or more central stores in each district, but dispersed to local storage facilities based on how units carrying such weapons would be sent into the field. On top of this, the Soviet military was divided into five branches, which each deployed some sort of nuclear weapons. The Strategic Rocket Forces controlled strategic nuclear weapons in ICBMs. The Army used nuclear artillery shells and short range missiles. The Air Defense Troops used nuclear surface-to-air missiles, plus nuclear anti-ballistic missiles (Galosh and Gazelle). The Air Force controlled heavy bombers with both tactical and strategic nuclear weapons. Finally the Navy had tactical nuclear weapons in all four of its major fleets (Black Sea, Baltic Sea, Northern and Pacific Fleets) while the latter two also contained all strategic nuclear missiles on submarines. Command and control was structured very differently from the US equivalent, and by the late 1980s it relied on a cheget or \"nuclear briefcase\" system of codes providing permission to fire. Three suitcases were issued - one to the Soviet leader (Gorbachev, when the system was implemented), one to the Defense Minister, and one to the Soviet Chief of General Staff. General Staff officers themselves controlled the launching process, and even had workarounds where permission to fire via the cheget system wasn\\'t necessary. As an aside, the only time all suitcases appear to have been under a single person\\'s control was during the August 19-22, 1991 coup, when the State Emergency Committee (including Defense Minister Dmitry Yazov) appears to have held all three. Anyway, as the USSR dissolved, eleven republics (so all the Soviet Socialist Republics minus Georgia and the Baltics) signed the Alma-Ata Protocols which established the Commonwealth of Independent States. These states agreed that all strategic nuclear weapons would remain under a single command (based in Moscow), that all tactical nuclear weapons should be transferred to Russia, that no nuclear proliferation should be undertaken, and that there would be a joint command of the Soviet military continued under the CIS. So operationally, nuclear weapons remained under the control of President Yeltsin (who got Gorbachev\\'s cheget when the latter resigned on December 25, 1991) and the continuing-Soviet-but-now CIS Defense Minister and soon CIS Chief of General Staff Air Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov (who by the way just died last month from Covid). However, politically and administratively, notable stockpiles of nuclear weapons, as noted above, were still in Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan at the beginning of 1992.',\n",

Gable was assigned to film units in action and was almost shot down on one mission. Stewart and Niven were in combat units and saw extensive action. Stewart eventually made it to the rank of Brigadier General in the USAF Reserve. (He was given an additional promotion to Major General on the retired list long after his retirement. His promotion to Brigadier General occurred in 1959 and was merit based). Fairbanks was a second generation Hollywood actor who was a leading man in his own right. His father Douglas Fairbanks and step-mother Mary Pickford founded the movie studio United Artists. He was commissioned as a Lieutenant in the US Naval Reserves at the start of the war. He was given a relatively safe staff position in England under Mountbatten early on, but became aware of operational concerns after a convoy he had been part of planning was decimated during its mission. It was the aftermath of that that is of interest here. Fairbanks actually used his prominence to further military operations. Fairbanks was transferred back to the states where he immediately began lobbying for a unit dedicated to military deception operations. He was able to get meetings with officials high in the Navy hierarchy that would normally not be available to someone of his rank and position. He eventually convinced the officials that such a unit was needed. The unit called The Beach Jumpers was created and Fairbanks was assigned as its commander. That unit was used extensively in the latter part of WW2 and saw some heavy action. That unit existed under that name until the end of the Vietnam War. The unit does have active descendants to this day. Source: A Hell of a War by Douglas Fairbanks Jr As to the rest, a very large percentage of stars were drafted, but then put into PR roles. Ronald Reagan, for instance, spent the war doing films for the US army and bond promotions.',\n",
       " 'Egyptian modernization efforts was funded via cotton export. Ongoing Industrial Revolution in Europe generate massive demand for cotton used in textile mills across continent. One of reforms introduced by Muhammad Ali Pasha in 1822 was encourage cotton farming in Egypt, while it was highly successful and makes Egypt 5th largest cotton producer in 1850s. Model was simply, encourage farmers to produce cotton, sell it to Europe and gained funds put into army and administration reforms and new state-owned industries which was based on government contracts or was export oriented. Problem was \"Dutch Desease\" (apparent causal relationship between the increase in the economic development of a specific sector and a decline in other sectors), which take control over Egypt economy in similar manner to cotton growing regions in post-communist Central Asia. Cotton is a labor-intensive crop, so a lot of egyptian farmers was tied to planting cotton, so whole families was working on fields just to produce quality cotton, but to competitive, their margin on cotton sales had to be as low as possible. But high cotton prices makes this model more profitable than pre-1822 grain based agriculture in Egypt. Until cotton prices collapse. When US Civil War start, global cotton prices skyrocket leading to \"Cotton Starvation\". European powers which was tied to quality cotton import from USA and Egypt for their burgeoning textile manufacturing. Civil War and \"Plan Anaconda\" cut off access to cotton (and this historical map from Civil War era clearly show this) While global demand for cotton was all time high, other countries start looking for their own cotton supply. Most notably cases are Brazil, India, Portugal colonies in Mozambique and Angola, France in West Africa, Tsarist Russia which encourage cotton production in Central Asia and of course USA which goes back on global cotton market after Civil War. This development become problematic for Egypt as local farmers had to compete on global market, so it tax revenue from cotton export. Even worse for Egypt, european industrialists during war improve their industrial parks, so they could use low-quality cotton for textile production. Their high-quality cotton, popular for their properties and how easy it can be used in industrial spinning mills was losing their export advantages. Post-war global cotton prices crash show up all ills of Egyptian economy. Cotton crash decrease export income for the egyptian treasury, which had to cut their spending, including government contracts for local industries and arnament programs in state-own armories and shipyards. But situation was worse in rural areas. Labor-intensive cotton production mixed with it\\'s low prices, decrease consumption spending which deeply affect local artisans and industries as they were dependent on rural consumption. Farmers was also in debt as they try increase their cotton production by buying land, quality sowing material and tools, so in next season they could earn more money. Major lender was landlords estates which take control over debtor land which increase rural poverty and decrease population consumption which decrease artisans and industrial activity in country, while undercuts small and medium farms with raw scale cash crops production in large estates which use indebted farmers families as increasing source of cheap labor in similar fashion to US sharecropper. Egyptian economy was in structural crisis, mixed with dependence on european credits and european markets, technical revolution in arnament industry makes already expensive army and navy unable to keep pace with european counterparts and political instability in 1860s and 1870s which hurts european investments in country.',\n",

       " 'Greetings! I shall attempt to find answer this most interesting question that you have put forth here, though right off the bat I would highly recommend Margaret MacMillan\\'s excellent publication Paris 1919: Six Months that Changed the World (2003, ISBN 9780375760525) for a more in-depth look at the Paris Peace Conference as a whole. With that recommendation out of the way, let\\'s begin. The German delegation at Versailles was composed of several key figures, all of whom brought some form of political agenda and feelings towards the Treaty. At it\\'s head was Reich Minister for External Affairs Count Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau, Reich Law Minister Dr. Landsberg, Reich Post Minister Johannes Giesberts, Prussian state president Robert Leinert, financial advisor Carl Melchior, and Professor Walter Schueking. All these men had practically the same reaction to the terms when it was presented to them on May 7th, 1919: utter shock and rejection of the Allied terms.^ Upon receiving the Treaty from French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, Brockdorff-Rantzau famously remarked in his speech: \"It is expected from us that we should accept the guilt of War. This statement would be a lie in my mouth.\" The problem with the German\\'s position however, meant that the delegation was incapable of altering the Treaty in any way, shape, or form. By not involving the Germans in the peace negotiations or the treaty writing process, the Allied Powers had essentially stripped all chance of getting the Germans to agree to their terms without the torrent of complaints which inevitably followed. Almost immediately after being presented the Treaty, the German delegation began drafting and sending \"notes\" to the Allied delegations about the impossibility of fulfilling the Treaty conditions, and some included counter-proposals to specific questions. Here are some of them: Protest on Reparations: The war reparations which Germany had to pay were crippling to say the least, and what\\'s even more shocking is that no one quite knew how much Germany had to pay when the Conference was concluded. In the end however, Germany offered Clause 231 (War Guilt): On May 13th, 1919 the delegation from Germany protested against the \"War Guilt Clause\", which stated that Germany accepted the responsibility (and hence the blame) for starting the Great War. The German text of this protest actually reads: \"The German people did not will the war and would not have undertaken a war of aggression. They have always remained convinced that this war was for them a defensive war... They cannot consider the former German Government as the party which was solely or chiefly to blame for the war.\" Clemenceau responded to this protest by bringing up a note from November 1918 sent by the previous German government to US Secretary of State Robert Lansing, in which Germany admitted that she was indebted to make reparations on account of \"Germany\\'s aggression by land, sea, and air.\" The Germans did agree to the concession of Alsace-Lorraine back to France, but vehemently protested the Treaty\\'s stipulation of giving up the coal mines in the Saar Basin, the East Prussian corridor to a newly-formed Poland, Eupen-Malmedy, Upper Silesia, Prussian Moresnet, and various other German-run districts in what would form Poland. These are of course, shortened versions and by no means an exhaustive list of the German protests at the Treaty of Versailles. The general experience of the German delegation was one of constant rejection and at times blatant antagonism by the Allied peacemakers. The chaos caused by the peace terms caused so much upheaval back home and in Versailles that Brockdorff-Rantzau left the Paris Peace Conference, and Germany\\'s first democratically elected Chancellor Philipp Sceidemann resigned on June 20th over the Treaty. The Allies pressed the Germans, essentially giving them an \"ultimatum\" to sign the Treaty or (at least in the minds of the German government) face a renewed invasion of German territory and a continuation of the armed blockade. The new government quickly dispatched Foreign Minister Hermann Mueller and Colonial Minister Johannes Bell to accept the Allied peace terms, and the Diktat von Versailles (Decree of Versailles) was signed by the Germans on June 28th, 1919. In short, though the Germans tried frantically to protest and revise the treaty terms, the Allies refused to budge on almost all but the smallest of problems. Hope this response helps, and feel free to ask any follow-ups you may have!

       " 'I\\'m afraid this is another one of those popular quotes that was never actually said by the author. It\\'s spread around in various forms on the internet. It might have been a bad translation or a butchery of this sections of Politics: But in this section, Aristotle is speaking about how both oligarchies and democracies are deteriorated by the dominant group doing what they want and how self-discipline is needed in the state as well as the individual, \"for to live in conformity with the constitution ought not to be considered slavery but safety \". He says that democracies are defined by their liberty and the sovereignity of the people, but if liberty is defined as doing whatever you want, without self-discipline, liberty will be destroyed in the state.

       " \"The short answer is religion, proximity, and sympathy. The American perspective of the IRA's existence and operation was obviously not uniform, and the majority of Americans remained apathetic, but there was a significant number of Americans who were sympathetic to the cause. These Americans were largely clustered in the northeast of the country, in cities such as Boston, where large quantities of Irish-Americans lived. At the time of The Troubles, the era of the Potato Famine and horrible anti-Irish racist sentiment were not far removed from the Irish-American consciousness. Additionally, Irish families would go to Catholic mass every Sunday and hear from the elders after service, where many were able to recall the brutal suppression of Irish freedom fighters in 1917. It was the religious and cultural ties to Ireland that made many sympathetic to the cause. Today it is estimated that 10% of the US population has Irish ancestry, which is a very significant figure. But what about those who were not Irish and still supported the cause? These people fall mainly into two groups: socialists and patriots. The socialists would want to see a united Ireland to progress the values of socialism across the world, as having a country as significant as Ireland being socialist would bring further legitimacy to the somewhat experimental (at the time) ideology. The patriots fall into a much simpler sect of the American psyche. Although it may seem quaint, the US is a nation descended from freedom fighters, and many saw similarities between the Irish struggle and the American one. This was perpetuated by two larger factors: The British shedding her colonies after the Second World War; and the casual yet ever-present racism found in the United States. Some saw Ireland as just another imperialist colony that should be freed, and many saw Ireland subconsciously as a nation of white people who should inherently be free, just as the US was. The final point is proximity. The US is an ocean removed from Ireland, and the activities of the Provisional Irish Republican Army and other more radical groups were published in the US, but their impact in terms of the lives they took was not explicitly condemned by the press. In Belfast a car bomb would tear through a community, hurting the lives of both Catholic and Protestant alike, but in the US, the bomb could easily be portrayed as just another act of war between two struggling sides. Tom Clancy's Patriot Games is actually very good at depicting this reality, as the official IRA wants nothing to do with the fictional ULA's terrorist activities in the United States for fear of ruining their image. (See, sometimes watching all those action movies can pay off!) My answer was adapted from my two favorite books on The Troubles: Patrick Radden Keefe's Say Nothing, and Pringle and Jacobson's Those are Real Bullets. Here's also a great article written by Kevin Cullen for PBS describing some more nuanced variables about the American reaction to the troubles, including the cognitive dissonance of being sympathetic to the IRA but also being an American conservative.

       " 'It partly depends on which time period is being romanticized - the IRA of the 1920s was not the IRA of the \\'70s, though the latter iterations did much in their marketing to link themselves to it, and some similar tactics were utilized. The truth of it is that not that many Americans supported the IRA. There are well over 40 million people who identify as being of Irish descent. The population of Ireland is still lower today (~5 million) than it was before the mass exodus of the mid-19th century (~8 million), when millions left for the US, Canada, Australia, Argentina, etc. Many of those Irish communities in America stayed close-knit, often forming enclaves due to pricing of housing and having a connection to other Irish in the area. This was exacerbated by the general lack of hiring prospects and discrimination by WASP upper class Americans and hirers was a sour reflection of conditions they faced back home, though many laborer jobs were available. For example, the salt boilers of upstate NY or mines of Appalachia provided employment opportunities for men and older sons to send money home to larger cities along the coast, primarily NYC and Boston. While the Easter Rising, Irish War for Independence, and the Irish Civil War did not result in large numbers of refugees, it did result in a number of well-documented atrocities by the British, such as the Burning of Cork. Economic refugees continued to leave Ireland, though not in the numbers seen in the mid 19th century. They carried memories of British rule - the poverty that they saw as a result of British rule, the actual war with Britain, etc. My great great grandparents came over from Ireland during the 1910s, and my great grandmother was an infant or toddler at the time. Yet she had enough ingrained and cultural carrots and sticks growing up in an Irish immigrant community that she attempted to donate money to the IRA as an adult. So these stories become part of family histories. If you grow up hearing about British auxiliaries burning down your great uncle\\'s shop, you have a degree of ingrained beliefs about the situation over there. The later iterations of the IRA played to this history - getting Republican leaning Irish bands playing their songs that glorify the revolts and deeds of Irish against the English going all the way back to Cromwell is a form of legitimizing the movement and raising funds and awareness that the British could not compete with. Even recently the BBC barred Rod Stewart from performing two songs due their anti-English nature. The British actions did little to help matters - the Bloody Sunday shooting of protestors in 1972 was fodder for direct comparisons to Kent State or even the Boston Massacre. So it was easy for the whole affair to be sold to the Americans as a bunch of underdogs fighting against a colonial oppressor that had to resort to violence. It fits very well with the US national mythos - helped by the fact that well over a hundred thousand Irish immigrants served the Union in the US Civil War. The Anglo-Irish Agreement was even crafted by Boston-area Irish-descended American politicians, further solidifying this connection. TL;DR: The narrative that Americans hear is typically the Irish one, the British committed acts that remind us Yankees of both the worst of the Vietnam/Civil Rights protest massacres, and the conflict has echoes of the US independence war. Also music and family histories have done a great job linking pthe IRA as the successor to past revolts against the British/English.

       " 'I don\\'t think enough materials on East Asian civilizations from that era survived to make a detailed comparison, so what I can make are, at best, educated guesses based on what I know. (By the way, early East Asian warships were completely different from what we today will recognize as \"junk\". Junks are sailing ships, whereas early East Asian ships were oared.) From what I can tell, at least in China during the Han Dynasty (Korea was still in its Gojoseon era, and I know next to nothing about them), and its preceding Qin Dynasty and Warring States, focused more on riverine warfare. This means their ships would be more optimized for that kind of warfare, but how this translates to other qualities like say \"seaworthiness\", I can\\'t tell. As far as tactics and technology go, East Asia warships seem to lean heavily towards the shooty side, as opposed to the classical galley with its ram and boarding (they still did not shy from boarding action though). The Chinese capital ship of the era, known as \"Louchuan\" or tower ship, is essentially a big, three (or more) decked floating fortress. The early mass-adoption of crossbow and traction trebuchet (single pole trebuchet takes up very little space, so you can mount a literal boatload onto one ship. Also it can pivot to shoot at another direction, and doesn\\'t have tremendous kickback like torsion-based siege engine that may damage the deck) probably helped them in this regard. Chinese warships seem to be enclosed rather than open-top, and its uppermost deck often had crenellations. Common Han-era warship classes were: Louchuan (Tower ship/capital ship/flagship), Doujian (Fighting ship/general warship), Mengchong & several other classes of \"assault\" ship like Maotu, Lunao, Xiandeng, Chimazhou etc. (their difference and roles are unknown, but seem to be distinct ship classes. Probably include some kind of general purpose light warship, dedicated boarder, and at least one type of heavily armored fast attack ship designed to dash into enemy formation and shoot at every direction), and Chihou (scout ship) etc. As a side note, Chinese people also invented sternpost-mounted rudder at around 1AD, although they still used steering oar. What benefits this invention bestowed to their warships, I have no idea.',\n",

       " 'Part 1 In 1946 Austria’s all party government celbrated »950 years of Austria«. Referencing the first recorded mentioning of the name »Ostarrichi« in a document issued by the then emperor of the HRR, Otto II, in the year 996 A.D. this event marks a rather significant change in the national discourse of Austria: Proclaiming the existence of an Austrian nation ranging as far back in time as to outdate even the Habsburg monarchy, was a significant development in the post-war rise of Austrian nationalism and national identity. The first ever such celebration of an Austrian nation – not to be confused with the rule of the House of Habsburg over certain hereditary lands – was one of the first significant measures of a campaign of nation building in Austria following the Second World War. Only then and through such and similar measures of nation building did emerge the national identity and nationalism of Austria, which still remains the at-large consensus in Austrian political and social discourse up until today: That, in contradiction to the at-large social consensus in the time of the advent of nationalism in Europe in the second half of the 19th century or even in the First Republic from 1918 to 1933, Austria was not to be part of a larger German nation due to its population being German in the national sense but was and remains its own culture, nation, and political entity due to its history, its culture, and rise of nationhood independent from the various political incarnations of Germany. The Austrian case stands out when considering it within the larger context of the history of the rise of the ideology of nationalism in Europe as well as the context of the theoretical debates on nation, nationalism, and nationhood. The comparatively late emergence of a socially consensual understanding of the political entity Austria as a nation combined with its process of nation-building that constituted the immense shift from the popular understanding of Austria as not being able to »survive on its own« and the deep sense of needing to be part of a larger German nation to the idea of an Austrian nation independent from Germany owes largely to the need for a new national narrative post 1945, which allowed Austria the ethical advantage of distancing itself from Nazi crimes as well as the specific formative experience of the national entrepreneurs of having experienced persecution of the Nazi regime. In short, I will examine the history of nationalism in Austria and emphasize the development post 1945 when the Austrian nation was invented and its ideology was spread through a variety of measures and by a certain group of national entrepreneurs. I aim to show that the Austrian case is a prime example for modernist theories of nationalism, especially those of Roger Smith, which view nationalism and the nation being something »invented« in accordance to certain historical, political, social, and economic factors. ## “Austria has no idea”: German nationalism in the Habsburg empire Eric Hobsbawm describes “the nation as an invented tradition” . “The ‘nation’, with its associated phenomena: nationalism, the nation-state, national symbols, histories, and all the rest. All these rest on exercises in social engineering.” Concepts such as the nation, a standard language, citizenship connected with certain rights and associated with certain character traits have to be invented and spread; they have to be made accepted by a populous through a “suitably tailored discourse” in order to serve a specific political purpose, such as justifying the rule of certain political and social elites and/or systems of governance as well as political, social, and economic institutions, e.g. the modern state. The process Hobsbawm describes was in full swing in Europe in the second half of the 19th century, essentially because Absolutism and its model of divinely justified rule had come under attack by enlightenment ideas and political movements following the French revolution. Absolutism had lost its “persuasive story” . Roger M. Smith when analyzing the formation of identities in the modern age coined this concept. He states that membership in a political community, “a “political” people” is contingent on two fundamental factors: “coercive force and persuasive stories” . Narratives of peoplehood are what win allegiance to a political order. Smith goes into detail, describing three independent yet intertwined types of stories that inspire persons to embrace membership in a political group: Economic stories that offer material benefits for membership; political power stories that offer security and participation in greater collective power; and – the most powerful of all – ethnically constitutive stories, which suggest that “membership in a particular community is somehow intrinsic to who its members are, in ways that are ethically valuable.” This concept is highly valuable in explaining the upsurge of nationalism in Europe in the second half of the 19th century. The newly created nation-state offered material benefit through market capitalism and its associated laws and guarantees; political power through its administration, its standing military, and participation in it through its constitutional guarantees; and ethical value through loyalty to an idea much greater than one dynastic house – that of a national identity. In the course of this process, the Habsburg monarchy unsurprisingly given its multi-lingual and historically diverse population became a hot-spot for newly emerging nationalist aspirations. Anthony D. Smith defines nationalism as the ideology concerned with “national autonomy, national unity and national identity” . And while Hungarian as well as Slav national entrepreneurs in the Habsburg monarchy were able to develop persuasive stories and political programs concerned with autonomy, unity and identity, the ruling class was unable to develop a counter-program, which could create a raison d’etre for the Habsburg state beyond its dynastic ties. Nineteenth-century ideologist and German national theorist Paul de Lagarde writes in his Deutsche Schriften: “Prussia has not a sufficient body for its soul while Austria has no soul for its more than sufficient body. Austria lived from the beginning for its duty to be Germany’s protection against the Hungarians, later on to be its rampart against the Turks; what for does it live now? (…) Austria has no idea that keeps it together.” Writing these words in 1878 it is not difficult to understand where Lagarde is coming from given that in 1848 the banner of German unity flew over the Stephansdom; that in 1866 when Bismarck’s »kleindeutsch« Empire began to emerge Grillparzer wrote: “Als Deutscher bin ich geboren – Bin ich noch einer?” ; that in 1882 some of the most prominent Habsburg Austrian political figures published a call for unity with German, the Linzer Program. The Linzer Program is one of the pivotal documents for understanding German nationalism in the Habsburg monarchy. It was originally drafted by the left wing of the Deutschliberal Partei, which was the most prominent force in cisleithanian politics following the Ausgleich in 1867. It’s most prominent authors included Georg Schönerer, leader of the German nationalists in Austria, later the Alldeutsche Movement and due to his virulent anti-Semitic stance a known influence on the young Adolf Hitler and Viktor Adler, at that time active member of the Deutschnationale movement who later founded the Social-democratic Party and became one of its ideologically influential members. The program called for a separation of the crown lands that had been part of the German Bund from those that had not been (e.g. Galicia or Dalmatia) and de-facto political unity of the former with Germany through a customs union a customs union and a state treaty. Furthermore, it pressed for the introduction of democratic reforms and for embracing German as the new official national language. While some like Frantisek Palacky, Friedrich Schlegel or Hugo von Hoffmannstahl tried in their writing to an Austrian idea or counter narrative to documents like the Linzer Program, due to a ruling class unable to see the signs of the time and too timid to take necessary steps in order to accommodate the non-German speaking population of its empire, the lack of a transnational raison d’etre over and above the dynastic bond became more and more apparent in the Habsburg empire. And with the lack of a counter narrative, it is hardly surprising that a large part of an important segment of the German speaking population – educational elites, students, young academics and emerging parts of the bureaucracy – turned to »Deutschnationalismus«, which understood Austria (as in the German speaking parts of the empire) as belonging culturally and nationally to the unified German empire rather than the fledging multi-language Habsburg one. A trend only to become stronger once the Habsburg Empire was abandoned and the First Republic emerged.',\n",
       " 'I\\'m afraid this is one of the many things that 300 has garbled completely. There was no Oracle at Sparta. Nor was there a divine mandate against Leonidas marching out. The ephors (a board of 5 annually elected magistrates) ordered him to pick his troops and march. This was in accordance with the Greek alliance’s general plan to stop the Persians at Thermopylai and Artemision. Leonidas and his men left Sparta weeks before any religious restrictions related to the Karneia festival or the Olympic Games came into effect. In the graphic novel and movie, the corrupt Oracle prevents the Spartans from marching out in force, to which Leonidas responds by choosing 300 companions to go for a northward stroll, in open defiance of the Council of Elders. No surviving version of the story of Thermopylai ever even hints at such a rift between Leonidas and the Spartan authorities. There are two probable reasons why 300 nevertheless chose to tell the story this way. The first is unique to its version of history: it goes to absurd lengths to glorify the person of Leonidas. It makes him dramatically younger (the real Leonidas was about 60 at the time of his death), which helps to make him more physically attractive and capable while also closing the age gap with his wife Gorgo (who would have been about 27). Of course, he is shown to be a passionate and considerate lover, and we are never told that the woman he is having sex with was his niece. The adaptation also takes away the blight of sacrilege that clung to Sparta after the murder of the Persian messengers and instead paints this outrage as a heroic act on Leonidas\\' part. Throughout the story, Leonidas is the wisest councillor, the best fighter, the most faithful husband and servant of his state, the most mature and forward-thinking leader but also the fiercest and bravest warrior, and so on. In short, the movie 300 is committed to making Leonidas into a paragon of “Western” masculine virtue. But this moral ideal is a modern one. It warps the historical figure to make him fit modern sensibilities. Agnostic, rational independence of mind and defiance of authority fit our picture of the perfect man better than the real Leonidas’ piety and blind obedience to the laws of his community, and so his story was rewritten to \"update\" his behaviour. Instead of taking oracular pronouncements as the literal words of the gods, he recognises them as bald-faced political manipulation. Instead of following the ephors’ orders to a fault, he now cheekily ignores their decision for the greater good. This rewrite takes away the entirety of Herodotos’ explanation for Leonidas’ last stand (namely, that he could not bring himself to leave the station he had been assigned by the ephors). The version of 300 therefore has to replace it with a newly invented narrative about an attempt to show that the Persian king is mortal (in fact the kings of Persia never claimed otherwise). The second reason has a much longer backstory. It is to do with a plot hole in the ancient Spartan propaganda narrative that 300 builds on. After the war was over, the Spartans let it be known that it had been their unrivalled commitment to the fight against Persia that rallied the Greek resistance and led to final Greek victory. They wanted everyone to believe that Spartan willingness to sacrifice themselves for the common good had been absolute from the start. But any critical observer could point out that the force they had sent to Thermopylai was wildly insufficient to stop Xerxes. The Athenians had sent their entire fleet, but the Spartans had sent less than 10% of their army. If the Spartans were really so dedicated to the defence of Greece, why had they only sent a handful of men to the pass, and why had they asked their allies for only a few more in support? We learn from Herodotos that the Spartans told two different stories to explain this. The first was that an oracle had foretold that one of their kings would die, but this would bring them victory. Considering this oracle, the ephors and the Council of Elders decided to send Leonidas with a small force on a deliberate suicide mission. According to this story, they sent only a few men because they knew, and actively planned, that Leonidas and his men would be defeated and killed to save the rest of Greece. However, for those who remained sceptical, they also told a second story, which was that when the army was sent out, it was only meant as an advance guard. The rest of the levy would follow later, but could not march right away with Leonidas, because the Dorians of the Peloponnese were observing the Karneia festival (and the people of Elis, one of Sparta’s bigger allies, were keeping the Olympic truce). The first story is improbable; while the army sent to Thermopylai was clearly much too small to stop the Persians, it was much too large to be a plausible suicide squad. Meanwhile the second story is demonstrably a lie. Herodotos gives us a clear sense of the chronology of the events, showing that the start of the Karneia was still at least 10 days away when Leonidas left Sparta. There was no reason for anyone to stay behind in the Peloponnese (and indeed, those who went to fight at sea with the Athenians sailed in full force). It is clear what is really going on here: the Spartans meant to send only a token force for the defence of Central Greece, and fabricated some reasons when the other allies called them out. In any case, you can see how the movie 300 arrived at its strange version of the story. Frank Miller and the scriptwriters took the two Spartan excuses and mashed them together. Instead of the small force being the result either of an oracle or of a festival, they made it the result of an oracular decree to honour a festival. In the process, they turned Leonidas’ actions from the obedience of an oracle and/or public decision into the defiance of an oracle and the related public decision. The whole thing seems to be part of a deeply unhistorical attempt to make oracles and religious festivals into superstitious obstructions to the heroic deeds of Spartan soldiers, rather than as the core motivations that they themselves offered to explain what they had done.',\n",

       " 'Unity was not something that came easy to them! Because the colonies had been individually chartered without much knowledge of the actual geography, there had been significant disputes over boundaries, and some of those remained- New York and New Hampshire both claimed what\\'s now Vermont, for example. And there were overlapping claims on the territories to the west, as well. There were regional differences- the planters of the South had different interests than the Boston merchants. Even within state borders, there were divisions. In North Carolina, for example, the wealthy planters in the lowland east had total control of the state government, and mostly ignored the poorer settlers in mountainous west. Lastly, although \"unity\" sounds pleasant, it also requires diffusion of authority- if the states of , say Maryland and Virginia combined, the governors and legislators of Virginia would in some ways have to take into account what the governor and legislators of Maryland want. Surrendering power is seldom done willingly by people, especially politicians! The Revolutionary War was the first time, really, that all those 13 colonies had a very good reason to unify. Although they were the first to use the name The United States, the Articles of Confederation were a very short agreement that mostly limited itself to describing how the states were going to cooperate to fight that war. The Articles didn\\'t create a real executive branch. The Continental Congress, that was the only national government ,couldn\\'t levy a national tax, couldn\\'t easily do treaties and diplomacy. It was only after the War that the United States realized it needed to have something more of a national government, which led to the Constitutional Convention in 1787. Even then, the creation of a powerful Federal government was controversial: there were a number of Anti-Federalist politicians who correctly saw it diminished their own authority, who wished for a much more limited national government. And the dispute over the limits of that national government continued into the 1800\\'s. Especially over the issue of slavery: as the US had both slave-holding and free states, the Federal government had to mediate the division, deal with two different sets of laws within the same country. That was impossible to easily solve ( the Dredd Scott decision by the Supreme Court was a futile attempt to solve the problem by essentially making slavery legal everywhere) and would eventually lead to the Civil War.',\n",
       " 'The relative \"whiteness\" of various European immigrant groups is one of the most common questions I\\'ve gotten as an immigration historian, and in my opinion it is one that we as a field have done a terrible job at adequately answering. I am still probably going to fail at that task in this short response, but bear with me. \"Whiteness Studies,\" particularly studies that examined the relationship between whiteness and European immigrants, saw a flurry of activity in the 1990s, anchored by works such as David Roediger\\'s The Wages of Whiteness and Matthew Jacobson\\'s Whiteness of a Different Color . These works sought to do several things, chief among them figure out who counted as \"white\" in different cultural, legal, and (pseudo)scientific contexts. The top-line, undeniable takeaway of this body of scholarship is that throughout Western history, the definition of who \"counts as white\" has been unstable and evolving. Whiteness, therefore, is not simply a matter of pigmentation, but a reflection of various other social factors. We run into trouble, however, when we try to disentangle the various factors that made someone \"white\" or \"not white,\" and figuring our which ones mattered the most. The work I\\'ve most commonly seen cited in discussions of Irish racial ambiguity is Noel Ignatiev\\'s How the Irish Became White. This is obviously an extremely provocative title, and it is one that I find frustratingly misleading for reasons that I will get into below. Ignatiev\\'s guiding question is how the Irish moved \"from oppressed to oppressing,\" and, drawing heavily from Roediger, focuses on post-Civil War developments in labor that drew a social distinction between \"black work\" and \"white work\" (111-112). The arc, according to Ignatiev, goes from the treatment of the Irish by English colonists in Ireland (what he calls \"a classic case of racial oppression\" ), to a \"white republic\" that emerged from the ashes of both slavery and nativism. While he raises several important points in evaluating how the Irish achieved the economic and personal freedom, as well as \"citizenship\" (which he leaves poorly defined) that he considers to define 19th century whiteness (2-3), I have several problems with Ignatiev\\'s argument. The first and most damaging is that the United States government has always legally considered the Irish to be white. Congress has the enumerated responsibility for setting naturalization policy, and passed the Nationality Act of 1790, which limited the right to naturalize to \"any Alien being a free white person.\" This law remained in place until 1870, when naturalization was also extended to \"aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent.\" This was not modified again until 1906. Throughout this entire period, there was never any serious challenge to the common sense understanding that the Irish were white for the purposes of citizenship law. To be sure, there were challenges to the voting rights of naturalized Irish-American citizens in some states during the Know-Nothing movement of the 1850s. The most well known of these was the 1858 Two Years\\' Amendment in Massachusetts, which denied the right of suffrage to naturalized immigrants until two years after they obtained citizenship. However, while this sprung from widespread anti-Irish hostility among \"Old Stock\" Massachusetts residents, the impetus for this hostility was much more anti-Catholic sentiment than a sense that the Irish were not \"white.\" Second, the arguments of Ignatiev and others who focus on anti-Irish discrimination draw disproportionately upon episodes from the eastern seaboard in general and from Massachusetts in particular. For example, Hidetaka Hirota\\'s excellent Expelling the Poor: Atlantic Seaboard States and the Nineteenth-Century Origins of American Immigration Policy convincingly demonstrates that anti-Irish animus was strong enough in the 19th century to bring about some of the first organized deportations of paupers and the disabled. This would suggest that anti-Irish sentiment has been foundational in American attitudes towards who does or does not count as a potential American. These efforts to disenfranchise and to culturally or economically marginalize the Irish were very real. At the exact same moment, however, Irish-Americans in other parts of the country were being empowered through their legal identity as white to seize greater economic and cultural control. This was most visibly on display in the far west, where Irish workers were key in the anti-Chinese movements in California and elsewhere, and evident in slightly less dramatic form in states such as Wisconsin, where white immigrants were given suffrage rights even before formally obtaining citizenship in the interests of expanding the electorate and expediting statehood. My third point is more speculative, but I get a sense that for as ground-breaking as Jacobson\\'s Whiteness of a Different Color is, it may be somewhat misused. The late nineteenth and early twentieth century shift towards \"scientific racism,\" as Jacobson clearly demonstrates, meant that people were completely in earnest when they divided whites into racially distinct Teutons or Anglo-Saxons or Slavs or Mediterraneans. The former two were culturally, economically, and pseudoscientifically white, while the latter two were not, but were legally classified as white for the purposes of immigration law (though the government sought to limit their access to the US through the Johnson-Reed Act of 1924). I suspect that much of the conversation surrounding the Irish specifically reads that view of the world anachronistically into the early 19th century. In sum, legally speaking, the Irish have always been white. Culturally and economically speaking, it gets more complicated. The task, then, is to figure out if discrimination being directed against the Irish on cultural and economic grounds takes away their \"whiteness.\" It\\'s fair for people to land on either side of that debate, although my personal feeling is no, given that: 1) the most intense period of anti-Irish discrimination preceded the heyday of scientific racism. I think it is entirely legitimate to talk about how Italians or Jewish immigrants became white (as Matthew Guglielmo and Eric Goldstein do), because the largest periods of their immigration coincided with pseudoscientific arguments that expressly and predominantly couched opposition to their immigration in racial terms. At this point, however, the Irish had been explicitly cast as part of the \"Old Stock\" of American society, alongside Anglo- and German-Americans (this, by the way, would be the answer of when they were \"folded into\" a more or less unimpeachable sense of white identity as we now think of it). 2) it relies on a \"common sense\" linkage of whiteness and citizenship in all its legal and cultural forms. Ignatiev relies (I suspect without realizing it) on a post-Reconstruction conception of citizenship as a binary: either you\\'re a fully equal member of the body politic or you\\'re not. In reality, questions of citizenship and belonging were much more nuanced during the main period of Irish immigration. Some scholars who have touched upon this include William Novak and (through studies of African Americans) Martha Jones and Stephen Kantrowitz. The argument from Ignatiev is that groups who suffer discrimination are ipso facto not white and can only truly establish their whiteness through labor and voting rights, which I find a dubious assertion. At the end of the day, the answer to legal whiteness is clear. Cultural and economic whiteness gets more tricky. Do you need to have, as Ignatiev puts it, the right to be an oppressor rather than oppressed? Does your religion need to be considered mainstream? Do laws directed against your group, such as prohibition, mean you\\'re a population that needs to be governed, and therefore bear the markers of non-whiteness? Are cartoonish caricatures enough to designate you a racial other, and if so, how grotesque do the caricatures need to be? I don\\'t think we have any good or clear answers to these questions, and certainly no consensus ones, but that\\'s what the conversation hinges on. &#x200B; I am not touching here upon the claims made by earlier English authors that the Irish in Ireland were racially distinct, just the Irish-American experience My own work suggests that Hirota captures something big, but misses a key dynamic that leaves us with a disproportionate emphasis on \"Old Stock\" fears and actions in the origin of immigration policy',\n",
       " 'Great question! You’re right to note that until relatively late in the game the English royal court was not as settled as we imagine it, with an established capital etc. Much of the infrastructure of governance was gathering around the monarch him(her)self, which regularly moved from place to place eating their nobles out of house and home (I kid, but only a little - royal visits could very well set a noble back in terms of their provender). Interestingly enough, the Center of the royal treasury initially stayed in Winchester - old capital of the Anglo-Saxon kings of Wessex and then England - even after the Normans assumed the mantle of Kings of England. A good historian would point out that while conquest brings many changes, often the tale is one of basic continuity rather than immediate and substantial shifts. For at least three monarchs (William, Rufus and Henry I) the tax infrastructure of the Anglo Saxons played a continuing role - geld, for instance, the land tax originally levied in order to pay off fleets of roving Danes, continued to be collected into at least Henry’s reign. In many ways Anglo Saxon England had one of the most advanced and comprehensive tax collection systems in Western Europe at the time, and initial Norman kings were loathe to disturb the flow of gold into their coffers. The center of this system had been a royal treasury at Winchester, and so it remained for at least 2 generations - you’ll remember that Henry I, after completely unsuspiciously fleeing the scene of his brother Rufus’ death, went straight to Winchester and seized the treasury before even trying to get crowned. If that’s not a mark of its importance as the seat of royal finance I don’t know what is. But as things shifted, and we note the growth of an itinerant court throughout the Norman and Angevin period, the center of Royal Finance increasingly solidified around the Royal Person. Initially this was literally a chest in the royal chambers which would be used essentially as petty cash while moving around the kingdom. The officer in charge of the chamber, the Chamberlain, increasingly became involved in the spending and collecting of royal funds, eventually evolving into one of the more powerful and important offices in the kingdoms. Many of the shifts in royal administration that came to be the norm of following centuries find their origin with Henry I - a bright King intent to reform the administration. Our first pipe rolls, for instance, records of royal finance and tax collection, are found from his reign. I wanted to address your concern regarding precious metals being heavy and therefore hard to transport. In reality, precious metals as means of exchange were utilised precisely because they were easily transported, especially compared to large quantities of agricultural goods like grain, livestock, hides, wool etc. Having gold (or more likely silver) on hand allowed a great deal of financial flexibility for the King. And in terms of the royal retinue being a tempting target - what madman would consider attacking the King’s retinue? Very often the royal entourage included at least a hundred knights/soldiers sworn to the King, and in medieval England this was nothing to sneeze at. I’ve read one author who explains that Henry II, one of the ‘great kings’ of the Regnal list, was followed by practically an entire army including siege weapons (or at least the engineers to build and use them), making a visit from the King a daunting event. And this was crucial - barons were prone to rebellion and disloyalty, and so the itinerant royal court served the purpose of ‘checking in’ on the great barons to display the power and prestige of the King. As royal administration centralised over the course of the 14th and 15th centuries, and role of Parliament in voting taxes increased, London increasingly became the center of Royal government. But it wasn’t a quick shift by any means. The tracking of tax collection and debts was often done by royal sheriffs, who increasingly collected their records in ‘pipe rolls’ that I mentioned earlier, and which give us an amazingly detailed view of English royal finance in the medieval period. Edward Morris, who wrote Welsh Wars of a Edward I was a particularly gifted researcher when it came to climbing through the mountains of scrolls that are still extant in royal records. I hope this helped with at least some of your questions. Barlow, the Feudal Kingdom of England, 1042-1216 Prestwich, Plantagenet England, 1225-1360 Prestwich, Michael . Edward I Trevelyan, G. M. .

       " 'My answer has more to do with the groups that the Tlingit and other Northern Coast groups would get into conflict with on the Southern Coast (Southern BC into WA), particularly Coast Salishan groups. Both of these make me think that war was mostly slave raids by the elite of the region against other peoples of the Pacific Northwest and neighboring regions and their peoples (this is a complete guess). A fairly astute guess, slaves do need to come from somewhere and as such, warfare often involved raiding for slaves. who were the warriors, why did they fight, was it rare or constant? I\\'ll break this down within the contexts of Coast Salishan groups as I know them best and can characterize their methods of warfare easier. #1: Who were the warriors? For the eponymous peoples of the Salish Sea, from Sto:lo to Nisqually, there is a consistent understanding of what warriors are (though their criteria varies from North to South): A professional warrior differs from a random tribesman who is picking up a spear to defend his village. There is no illusion that what a professional warrior does is remotely noble or honorable unless they\\'re in the middle of defending the tribal group from a current threat. This being said and I noted, the understanding of just who or what constitutes a professional warrior varies a little from Northern to Southern Coast Salish. While the Northern, Central, and Southern Coast Salish could agree that the Warrior was a figure to be avoided, David E. Jones, in \"Native North American Armor, Shields, and Fortifications\" (which I strongly recommend) sums up the general understanding like so: Professional warriors, also found among the Coast Salish tribes, delighted in causing fear and consternation among their fellow villagers. The southern Salish tribes believed terrifying spirits, which they had been trained to seek in dreams and vision-seeking expeditions, animated these \"mean men.\" When going into battle, such men, through songs taught to them by their war spirits, could whip themselves into a berserk frenzy. Among northern Salish tribes, warriors did not seek spiritual powers to make them wild in battle but rather considered the role as a professional position which ran in families. Fathers in family lines that did not have the prerogative to create professional warriors still sought to elicit the desire to fight well in at least one of their sons. Though I cannot comment on the latter summation given about Northern Coast Salishan groups, I will note that he seems to be interpreting Southern Coast Salishan power songs as taking place immediately before a battle. I haven\\'t seen any other references to that specific claim though power songs were undoubtedly part of a Warrior\\'s lifestyle, I think Jones might be making it more metal than it would have really been (but it is a cool visual, right?). An observation that best sums up their interpretation of Warriors is best given by Florence James, a Penekalut Elder who relayed her understanding of the Cowichan Warrior Tzouhalem thusly: \"Everyone knows him as a bad man...and as a man like a monster. But, to me he was a warrior\" (Angelbeck and McLay 2009) As such, the consistent view of Coast Salishan Professional Warriors we get is that they (even if they are part of the nobility and come from prestigious families) are often on the outskirts of village life due to their temperament and line of work. #2: Why did they fight? Slave Raids: As you noted, warfare could be undertaken for procuring slaves. However, with the emphasis given to marrying outside the tribal community (preferably to tribes that the family has few or no ties with), slave raids were taken against communities distant enough to where they could reasonably assume no one in the war party had any blood ties to. As a result of seeking out unrelated and distant groups to attack, it has been noted by Jay Miller and others that one could have feasibly (and has) been captured from Vancouver Island and be sold to tribes along the Columbia River between Washington and Oregon. Disagreements: Probably the most common reason for war among Coast Salishan groups, though we should keep in mind that this can range from simple skirmishes over a brief period of time to full blown sieges on fortified villages. Gibbs notes a the presence of formal and prearranged battles by local tribal groups. His account notes that prior to the exchange of blows over the waters of the Sound, that there were attempts to come to an understanding and agreement by representatives of both tribes (presumably chieftains or other persons known for their skill with words) in order to avail bloodshed. If this failed, then a battle commenced via canoe wherein combatants exchanged spear blows while leaning the sides of their canoes toward the other. Notably, this affair seemed to be rarely deadly as Gibbs notes \"Owing to the curve of their canoes, and their impenetrable armor, it is seldom bloody... The same description will apply to most of the battles on the Sound except where northern tribes are concerned, who are more warlike and ferocious. (Gibbs 1877, 190-191)\". Tribal Affiliation (?): Unusually, there are also a few accounts of a particular Puyallup Warrior referred to as \"Zachias\" in Marian Smith\\'s 1940 work \"Puyallup-Nisqually\". Now the reason he fought seems unusual since while many Warriors fought for a variety of reasons, ranging from petty grievances to mourning to their power invoking a lust for blood, they tend to respond to direct threats affecting them or their relatives as opposed to the wider tribal group...except for Zachias who is consistently noted to be fervently against letting any Puyallup being taken as a slave. Once some Puyallup were all down at the beach to get clams. The men were off somewhere when two strange men landed. The women fed them and when they finished, the men made one of the young women and her children go in the canoe with them. They were taking them and when Zachias got back and found out what had happened, he was mad. The others didn\\'t want to do anything. But Zachias made one of the men go in his canoe with him and started in pursuit. He drew alongside the other canoe and told the woman and her children to get in with them told the men that he would let them go but, if he ever caught them a second time, he\\'d kill them. When he brought the woman back her husband had returned. Her husband said that he would have killed the men and given them another chance. Zachias never let a Puyallup be taken a slave. Once Zachias was away and when he got back he found out that some Indians had come in a canoe and stolen a girl. He made the men with him after the girl. When the other Indians saw the Puyallup coming they stripped the girl and left her on the beach. Zachias got her brought her back. When she was grown her parents gave her to Zachias as a second wife. There were no Puyallup slaves anywhere, he wouldn\\'t allow it. A man came here once asking for things and all the people cowered down and gave them to him. He was going to take Sitwell\\'s (Sitwell was village leader) son away as slave. But Zachias said, \"No.\" He jumped up with his knife and threatened the man. He went away then. Zachias never let anyone of Puyallup get taken slave. ---Smith, 1940, pp.160 To emphasize why this is peculiar, it\\'s that tribal identity tends to be widely seen as a more recent innovation with the establishment of (though of course, this does have its detractors even in the earlier days of anthropological study within the Puget Sound^). To have Tribal Elders recount a figure that is not only directly as the progenitor of a still present Puyallup family, but that those giving these accounts were only a generation or two away from him is remarkable. Outside Threats: As the excerpt from Gibbs notes, the Northern groups who automatically come to mind when \"Northwest Coast\" is brought up had little interest in partaking in a formal exchange of blows with honor satisfied. With that, this also meant that they had no allies within the region (outside of potentially more Northern Salishan groups with the Kwakwakaʼwakw) who would come to their aid or had any real initiative to not attack these foreigners. This resulted in efforts at organized responses, such as an example I\\'ve provided below describing the effects that Euro-American contact had, with Salishan groups understanding that they have a shared threat. #~~3~~ 4: How did Euro-American contact change war in the Pacific Northwest? The introduction of firearms among Northern groups led to increased raids on Southern ones. This was particularly prominent with the Lekwiltok of the Campbell River area of Vancouver Island, eventually culminating in an alliance of Salishan tribes from British Columbia to the Southern Puget Sound being gathered to meet them at Maple Bay in 1840 and prevent them from being a further threat. As a result of the introduction of firearms, armor faded from use alongside the more traditional implements of warfare such as spears, clubs, certain types of daggers, and bows. However, while they became less common, they were still present in the Puget Sound Indian War of 1855-56 with the occasional adoption of Euro-American tools and other implements for battle.

       " 'In many ways your question is related to one asked on how historians can study the past and not become nihilists: So you may find some insight there. The problem with answering it is that you are making an assumption which I think is probably false. Your assumption is that some people in some places thought current society was a degeneration from a superior past. In fact it would probably be more accurate to say that almost everyone in almost all places where a historical literature developed has thought like this. The Greek writer Hesiod describes a scheme in which the current state of the world is a decline from a golden age. In India, and this is very much picked up in the medieval period, there is the notion of the Kali age, that our current time represents a final degradation from a superior past, which first appears in writing in the fourth century AD. Buddhist literature is replete with properties of how degraded society will have become 500 years after the death of the Buddha (these tend to be written as prophecies). It is a common trope in Islamic and Christian historical writing that current events are particularly awful as a punishment for a lack of piety. Today our historical understanding is based much more on evidence rather than sentiment and so we know it is not true, we know that in very broad terms things have broadly gotten better in human society and continue to do so (for the arguments on this you could look at popular books by Ian Morris such as Why the West Rules, and The Measure of Civilization). Yet human being still seem generally inclined to believe things are getting worse, that civilization is teetering on the brink of final collapse. I cannot give examples due to the rules on referencing recent material but you will have read a newspaper headline. The real question is not whether some medieval people thought that way, yes they would have because most people have most of the time, but rather explaining the exceptions - why did people seem so positive at some specific moments, under the Roman Emperor Augustus, the Whig historians, or in the late 1960s.',\n",
       " 'Greetings! I shall attempt to shed some more light on the situation following u/etan-tan\\'s great and concise analysis of this curious declaration. Keep in mind that this topic is actually something which is historiographically obscure, as it does seem curious that an American President be so invested in the rebirth of an Eastern European state, let alone one which had been erased from maps for decades already. Let\\'s begin. The first point to Wilson\\'s specific singling out of Poland is, as etan-tan has already pointed out, the geopolitical importance of this state. Having been dismembered by the Austro-Hungarian, Prussian and Russian empires in the late eighteenth century, the Grand Duchy of Warsaw formed the core of this reborn Polish state, and it was therefore in line with Wilson\\'s underlying concept of self-determintation, in which the peoples of a territory determined their right to self-governance. The Polish people had been dominated by the Austro-Hungarians, Prussians (later Germans) and Russian for decades, so it seemed fitting to Wilson to give this rather large ethnic group their land to rule, as they had done so for centuries before their unfortunate dismemberment. That at least, is the belief which Wilson spread in his \"Peace Without Victory\" speech to Congress, when he presented the 14 Points. There was also the underlying Polish movement in America and Europe, elements of which were appealing to the American President for support in the cause of Polish independence. The most notable character perhaps (and one whom many historians have analysed in their writings) is one Ignacy Jan Paderewski, who would go on to become the first Prime Minister of the newly-reborn Poland in 1919. Paderewski was supposedly approached by Wilson\\'s personal friend and advisor Colonel House just weeks before the \"Peace Without Victory\" speech was given to advise on the Polish Question, though any primary sources on his actual contribution have yet to be uncovered (or simply do not exist at all). There is another historiographical debate on a far more selfish and Realpolitik-esque motive for Wilson\\'s stance on Poland: re-election. In much the same way Wilson had had to deal with the German-American voters in maintaining neutrality, some historians have pointed to his fears over being defeated in the coming elections. This theory does not quite stand up to scrutiny however, and its purveyors have been called out for lack of sources and the overarching argument that this could not have been Wilson\\'s main reason for supporting Polish independence. That is just a brief overview of the problems which plague the historiographical narrative of connecting Wilson to Poland, and more can always be said on the matter ( u/etan-tan has already covered in brief the European struggle to utilise Poland before Versailles), but we may never quite uncover why Wilson fatefully decreed the following to Congress: \"I take it for granted, for instance, if I may venture upon a single example, that statesmen everywhere are agreed that there should be a united, independent, and autonomous Poland,\" Sources: Howard, Michael.

       " 'The Treaties of Tordesillas and Zaragoza , basically. The Treaty of Tordesillas divided the New World and trade with Asia/Pacfic regions between Spain and Portugal, who were at the time the naval superpowers of Europe. That’s why the Portuguese established trading ports in Goa, India, for instance, while Spain couldn’t go much further than the Philippines (then the Spanish East Indies). The Treaty of Zaragoza settled the antemeridian set by the Treaty of Tordesillas, basically giving Portugal control of all Asia, including the so-called “spice islands”. Spain got most of the Americas and the Pacific. This is also why Spanish voyages tended to go across the Atlantic to the Pacific, instead of around Africa and across the Indian Ocean. Later on, as other countries established trading routes (Dutch, English, French, etc.), there began to be more encroachment onto these areas, as the spice trade and other trade goods from Asia (silks, porcelain, tea, among others) were very lucrative. Private companies like the Dutch and British East India Companies became very powerful as a result. Edit: thanks for the silver!',\n",

       " 'You\\'re indeed missing a step between chain mail and gambesons to cloth coats, and it is munition grade armor! During the 16th and 17th centuries, Musketeers wore little to no armor, usually wearing only a helmet if at all, because they had to be swift in combat to assume tactically advantageous positions, and also they were carrying guns that could be very heavy. But that\\'s usual of light infantry throughout the ages, the ones wearing armor were the heavy infantry, the pikemen, as well as the heavy cavalry, the cuirassiers. Pikemen were the counterpart to the handgunners, the former providing defense in close combat against cavalry and infantry charges and the latter providing firepower support. Since they engaged in close combat they were heavily armored, with back and breastplates, helmets, tassets, pauldrons and gorgets. To prevent rust, the exterior the of armour could be blackened by applying a mixture of linseed oil and soot; after heating, this left a permanent black layer. Due to cost considerations however some pikemen would actually go to battle with little or no armour, the armoured ones being placed in front of the infantry formation. This was munition grade armour that was of relatively low quality but also cheaper so that it could be mass produced, and it was effective for defending against arquebus shots at long range as well as opposing pikes. Cuirassiers, the heavy cavalry of the day, wore a similar set of armour but of higher quality, called three quarters armour since it dropped leg and lower back armour compared to traditional full plate because it had become too heavy. It was also often bulletproof, which meant that the armour was literally shot with a pistol and the dent would be \"proof\" that it was of quality. While a musket shot could penetrate it was still useful against long range arquebus shots and pistols as just alluded, as well as blunt weapons such as swords and pikes. So armor was still in use in the early 17th century and was very good at its job. I wrote more about the effectiveness, logistics and eventual demise of amour in another answer here (with a small bonus of helmet history :p)',\n",
       " 'In order to understand why the Quebec Biker War was so deadly -- 160 people were slain by the end of it, including some innocent civilians -- you would need to understand the stakes involved. They were high: Montreal was the entry point for many illicit drugs since the 1950s, such as heroin, cocaine, etc. with street values totalling billions of dollars. The cocaine trade accelerated in the 1970\\'s onward under a triumvirate of some of the most powerful organized crime groups in North America: the outlaw MC\\'s, La Cosa Nostra (mafia) and the Colombian cartels. A fourth player, the West End Gang were primarily importers of cocaine and hashish and had thrived on its influence in the Port of Montreal, with corrupt dock supervisors and workers on its payroll. Well-connected, these groups controlled the shipping of drugs from here to all points in North America. The Rizzuto crime family dominated the drug trade in Montreal at the time and, before the 1990\\'s, there was relative peace in the Montreal drug trade due to each group\\'s willingness to accept their roles of specialization in the network, mutual respect of boundaries and their collective deference to the Rizzuto crime family and its considerable influence. Independent operators were free to buy and sell on the open market. But the Rizzutos had overextended their reach by the 1990s, and the peace their pragmatic methods had forged in the underworld was fraying. This is where the bikers/outlaw motorcycle clubs come in. They were heavily involved in the distribution of illegal drugs, especially cocaine, and rivalry over dominance of the wholesale cocaine trade escalated in the 1990\\'s. The first shot (literally) began with the fatal shooting of Pierre Daoust at his repair shop by rival club the Rock Machine on July 13, 1994. He was linked to an associate club of the Hells Angels, the Death Riders. The next day police arrested members of the rival Rock Machine club who were preparing for an attack on another Hells Angels affiliate club, the Evil Ones. (A few months earlier, the Hells Angels had issued an ultimatum that any dealer had to buy from them exclusively, or face reprisals. MC\\'s opposed to the Hells Angels\\' efforts to monopolize the drug trade had formed an entity called the Alliance to challenge them.) Two days after the Daoust killing, high-ranking members of the Hells Angels met at a hotel in Longueuil. Police would later learn that these meetings were held to inform members that each chapter in Quebec would need to hold a vote to decide if they wanted to take part in the war. The vote was unanimous as all four Quebec chapters voted to go to war. This expanded the war beyond Montreal to the rest of the province and gave the Hells Angels more support than the Alliance. This triggered off about a decade of tit-for-tat slayings as either side targeted rival clubs and dealers who didn\\'t pick sides. The killing of innocent bystanders, including children, galvanized the public\\'s outrage at the wanton violence. The weaker Alliance clubs were overmatched by 1999 and losing badly. That summer, the Rock Machine became probationary members of the Bandidos, another outlaw MC with chapters around the world. Fearing that the Bandidos intended to expand into the neighbouring province of Ontario, the Hells Angels offered a truce to the Rock Machine. It is also likely that the Rizzuto family had pressured both sides to call a truce because the war had brought too much media attention to the underworld and caused disruption to the drug trade. The Hells Angels used the peace during the fall of 2000 to persuade several members of the probationary Bandidos to defect. Despite this, the remaining Rock Machine members joined the Bandidos in Jan. 2001, but the Bandidos had inherited a \"disorganized mess\", according to one ex-Bandido. The Hells Angels were dealt a blow in March 2001 with Operation Springtime, when authorities arrested 40+ members on drug trafficking and murder conspiracy charges. This opened up a void in the drug trade in Montreal and the Bandidos swept in to take over. The police had launched a probe in 2000 into the Quebec Bandidos and in June 2002, they arrested 62 people affiliated with the club -- essentially putting their entire membership behind bars and ending the Quebec Biker War.',\n",
       " 'A related question for the Historians: In the movie First Blood (Rambo), the lead character is given the same reception as the lead characters in Easy Rider, i.e.; unwelcome, and with comments about him needing a haircut etc. In the context of the film (released in 1982) this seems jarring, as long hair on men was widely acceptable at the time, and the John Rambo character does not seem particularly out of place. Writing of the book on which the film is based started in 1968, so it is roughly contemporaneous with Easy Rider.

       " 'Well before Christianity became the state religion in the Roman Empire, the Romans always had the believe that the gods were on their side. Succes after succes, they were the rulers of the world, the best, the strongest. The gods that they also copied from the Greeks by the way, only gave them different names (Zeus – Jupiter, Aphrodite – Venus, Hades – Pluto). In the 3rd century, it was thought that the gods no longer were on their side, they had been offended, and that needed an explanation. There was a long debate whether the rise of Christianity was responsible for some sort of weakening of classic Roman virtues, with its turn the other cheek emphasis, was so different from martial virtues that had organized the Roman empire. Occasionally some Christians were persecuted, but it tended to be local, sporadic There was not a longstanding consistent coherent uniformly applied Roman policy with respect to Christianity. The Roman historian Tacitus reports about violence against the Christian community in the city of Rome in the time of the emperor Nero (37 – 68 AD), and also other Roman emperors, such as Decius and Valerian did so, until the last prosecutions of Christians by Diocletian, because the Diocletianic, or Great Persecution was the only real attempt, and last and most severe persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire to systematically extirpate (uitroeien) the Christian faith from the empire, which lasted some 12 years from 299 AD to 311 AD. Why were there persecutions? Well, the Romans were trying to restore the ‘Pax Deorum’, the peace of the gods, return Rome’s loyalty to the pagan, traditional gods, and thus favour those gods in order for those gods to favour the Romans again. Well, Christians for instance refused to make sacrifices to the Roman gods. These emperors didn’t set out to persecute Christianity, their aim wasn’t to extirpate any religion, rather to restore religious peace in the Roman world, in the hope to bring back the favour of Rome’s gods to benefit, to support, to advance the Roman cause. But even before the persecution of Christians, Diocletian found also much to be offended by in Manichean religion: its novelty, its alien origins, the way it corrupted the morals of the Roman race, and its inherent opposition to long-standing religious traditions. Following some public disputes with Manicheans, Diocletian ordered that the leading followers of Mani be burnt alive along with their scriptures. In a 31 March 302 rescript from Alexandria, he declared that low-status Manicheans must be executed by the blade, and high-status Manicheans must be sent to work in the quarries of Proconnesus (Marmara Island, Turkey) or the mines of Phaeno in southern Palestine. All Manichean property was to be seized. he reasons he disliked Manichaeanism was at least equally applicable to his next target, Christianity. The Diocletianic or Great Persecution was the only attempt, and last and most severe persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire to systematically extirpate (uitroeien) the Christian faith from the empire, which lasted some 12 years from 299 AD to 311 AD. - Edict of Serdica (311 AD) Galerius issued an edict of toleration, which granted Christians the right to practice their religion, - Edict of Milan (312 AD) gave Christianity legal status and a reprieve from persecution, and returned confiscated Church property. - Edict of Thessalonica (380 AD) made Nicene Christianity the state religion of the Roman Empire. The reign of Constantine established a precedent for the position of the emperor as having great influence and ultimate regulatory authority within the religious discussions involving the early Christian councils of that time (most notably, the dispute over Arianism, and the nature of God). Constantine himself disliked the risks to societal stability that religious disputes and controversies brought with them, preferring where possible to establish an orthodoxy. One way in which Constantine used his influence over the early Church councils was to seek to establish a consensus over the oft debated and argued issue over the nature of God. In 325, he summoned the Council of Nicaea, effectively the first Ecumenical Council. The Council of Nicaea is most known for its dealing with Arianism and for instituting the Nicene Creed, which is still used today by Christians.',\n",

       " \"In the Iron Age, iron has the huge advantage of being more available and cheaper. Before the Iron Age, iron was rare and expensive, and didn't have this advantage. Bronze is easier to work, and can be recycled with less loss (iron is lost due to oxidation when forging). As for functional advantages, bronze had the advantage of being much more corrosion resistant. Iron has the advantage of lower density (but only a little lower), and greater stiffness (the Young's modulus of iron is about double that of bronze). Hardness is similar (this depends on the tin content of the bronze, and work-hardening of the bronze and iron). Toughness is similar (again, this depends on the tin content of the bronze). The difference in stiffness and density means that, for similar blade geometries, an iron weapon can be lighter than a similar bronze weapon. If the bronze weapon is made thicker, but otherwise retaining the same geometry, to be equally stiff, it will be about 40% heavier. However, it's easier to use weight-saving geometries to get that stiffness with a smaller increase in weight, by using, e.g., raised mid-ribs. It makes little difference for weapons. The difference in stiffness makes a big difference if using bronze or iron for the main weight-bearing structure in construction. A pound or two of iron is far too little to make an iron-framed building, and until the Industrial Revolution, iron was generally far too expensive to use as a major building material. So, (a) a pound or two of iron was not enough to do anything remotely amazing with, other than to impress people with its value and rarity, and its wondrous origin of falling from the sky, and (b) iron wasn't a super-material compared to bronze.

       " \"As /u/Platypuskeeper and I discussed in Was Slavery A Part Of The Hanseatic Trade? slavery (, or, thralldom as a legal concept) in medieval Scandinavia was definitely decline in middle- and long term, and it is difficult to evaluate how directly Christianization of Nordic countries contributed to this trend. I have to admit, however, to modify one area/ point to my argument above: At least, Northern Crusades since the 13th centuries did not took POW as long-term slaves to be sold somewhere else, but in the 12th century, some chroniclers like Saxo Grammaticus and Helmold of Bosau, and even Snorri Sturluson, note that 'officially' pagan Slavic Wends (Abodrites/ Obodrites) still held a large-scale pagan market in the southern coast of the Baltic, and they sometimes took some Danes and other Scandinavian people away from their homeland to sell there, though it was sometimes difficult to find appropriate buyers for such slaves (Jensen 2017). It is likely that the Danish conquest (Wendish crusade) against the Wends and successive Christianization in later 12th century probably put an end to this custom among the Wends, but even the conquering Danes still sometimes seemed to maintain some unfree people (i.e. thralls in a legal sense) into their household, as glimpsed from the testament of Archbishop Absalon of Lund (d. 1201) (see the linked post for further details). Thus, the tradition of slavery (thralldom) was not entirely died out at least in the 12th century Denmark, more than ca. 2 centuries after the Christianization, I suppose. So, not so sudden change of the significance of slavery around the turn of the 1st millennium, but rather a gradual transition from the slavery (thralldom) would be a more appropriate model. Add.

       " 'This story certainly has a long pedigree, and even if, as is typical with such fundamentally private matters, there is uncertainty as to what actually occurred, it is generally accepted that Byron did have sexual experiences of some sort from the age of nine, and such detail as survives appears to have originated ultimately with the poet himself. Byron\\'s most recent major biographer, Fiona McCarthy, sets out the details as follows: the incidents began when the future poet was living in Aberdeen with his mother, in significantly reduced circumstances caused by his father\\'s profligacy and early death. They involved a local \"free girl\" named May Gray, who had been hired by the mother as a servant and nurse, and who \"used to come to bed with him and play tricks with his person\". When this was discovered, and the boy admitted the encounters, she was \"sent off\". This, McCarthy adds, \"was presumably the episode to which Byron was referring when he wrote in his journal, \"My passions were developed very early – so early – that few would believe me – if I were to state the period and the facts which accompanied it.\" (Cochran, in his study of Byron\\'s sexuality, disputes the two passages are connected.) Gray\\'s \"tricks\" (we have no further details of exactly what they comprised) seems to have continued for two or three years, in the period c.1798-1799. We know nothing more of what occurred, or with what frequency, though it would seem likely that the encounters became more common later on, when Byron and Gray were living in lodgings together in Nottinghamshire, than they would have been in the cramped apartment the future poet shared with his mother in Aberdeen. Certainly it does seem true that once the superficially pious and respectable Gray was away from the watchful eyes of other members of the family, she quickly began to attract disapproval in local high society. Ann Parkyns, a friend of the Byron family, noted that she was often drunk, and the Byrons\\' socially ambitious solicitor, John Hanson, was sent to interview the boy, writing to Byron\\'s mother that: He told me that she was perpetually beating him, and that his bones sometimes ached from it; that she brought him all sorts of Company of the very lowest Description into his apartments; that she was out late at nights, and he was frequently left to put himself to bed... But Madam this is not all; she has even traduced yourself. Nothing in the surviving Byron correspondence, however, explicitly relates to sex, and the details of Gray\\'s sexual encounters with Byron emerged only much later – the first edition of the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography very conventionally claimed that the poet was and remained \"passionately fond\" of his nurse, and it was only starting in the 1950s that Byron\\'s biographers have felt able to discuss the reality of what occurred. In this context, it needs to be observed that the information that we have is really only at third hand, though the apparent respectability of the parties concerned has led Byronists to accept the details as accurate. Still, it\\'s worth noting that, to trust the account, we have to place credence not only in what Hobson the lawyer claimed that the 11 or 12-year-old Byron told him, but also in what one of Byron\\'s closest friends, the radical Whig politician and diarist John Cam Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton (1786-1869), claimed that Hobson told him after Byron\\'s early death in 1824. Hobhouse\\'s papers and diaries – which passed to the British Museum and subsequently to the British Library as the Broughton Papers, with the stipulation that they not be opened until 1900 – are the actual source of the few details that we now have. Anyway, I think it\\'s well worth concluding by pointing out that we need to see the incidents not, as Rotten.com and other online resources have generally tended to, as ones that resulted in Byron \"losing his virginity\" and discovering the pleasures of sex at an uncommonly early age. After meeting with Hobson and telling the layer what had transpired, the young Byron followed up with a letter begging that the nurse be dismissed and sent away, rather pathetically signing it from \"your young friend\" – so the evidence we have portrays not an adolescent who was uncommonly adventurous and mature for his age, but rather a boy traumatised by a serious case of child abuse. McCarthy summarises the situation as follows: The May Gray episode had important repercussions. Byron\\'s nurse was ostentatiously religious, and the coexistence of pious Bible study and lascivious behaviour sharpened his awareness of hypocrisy and cant, deepening his scorn of false religiosity and over-zealous Calvinism in particular. The strange and furtive memories of sex being forced upon him at this early age also influenced Byron\\'s sexual development, to the point where he negated the physicality of sex even as he indulged it. There are echoes of May Gray in a journal entry for December 1813: \"A true voluptuary will never abandon his mind to the grossness of reality. It is by exalting the earthly, the material, the physique of our pleasures, by veiling these ideas, by forgetting them altogether, or, at least, by veiling these ideas, by forgetting them altogether, or, at least, never naming them hardly to one\\'s self, that we alone can prevent them from disgusting.\"... The memories of female dominance, the large nurse in the small bed, affected his later attitudes to sex with women. Byron found a mature woman a complicated structure, threateningly flabby. He preferred the physique of young teenage boys, or the girls dressed as boys that became a feature of his early days in London. Byron\\'s preferred bodies would be youthful, lithe and firm. We don\\'t know much, finally about May Gray\\'s background. She was Scottish, apparently aged around 30 at the time of the incidents, and came from the Aberdeen area; after leaving the Byrons\\' service, she \"returned to her native country,\" married respectably, and died around 1843.

       " '\"it says that Cuba was an opponent of the Khmer Rouge and apparently so was the Soviet Union which I found slightly surprising because they are all influenced in some way or another by Marxism- Leninism concepts.\" There are some big, worldwide-level geopolitical issues here, as well as some regional power politics. If I were to sum up the former, it would be \"Sino-Soviet Split\". Basically, after Stalin\\'s death, and noticeably from 1956 when Khrushchev denounced Stalin and his \"cult of personality\" in the so-called \"Secret Speech\" given at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Mao very strongly disagreed with this \"revisionism\", and caused relations between the People\\'s Republic of China and the USSR to deteriorate (it got so bad that in 1969 there were border skirmishes between the two countries and they were almost at the point of a general war). The PRC (especially under Mao) very much saw itself as a rival leader for the world communist movement, and also as a more genuine supporter of anti-colonialism. A big reason for Richard Nixon\\'s 1972 visit to China and the eventual establishing of bilateral relations between China and the US is that both countries saw the other as a useful counterweight against the Soviets. How this played out in terms of Cambodia is more or less as follows. The Khmer Rouge had relatively strong links with China, while Vietnam had gravitated towards being more pro-Soviet. The Khmer Rouge, after taking over Cambodia in 1975 and imposing their genocidal regime there, ended up invading southern Vietnam (which until the 18th century had been ethnically Khmer territory), and Vietnam retaliated by invading Cambodia, and supporting a regime to depose and replace the Khmer Rouge (China continued to support the Khmer Rouge and recognized them as the legitimate government of the country; in a twist of Cold War politics, the US did the same as a matter of supporting the PRC and opposing the USSR). Cuba was likewise a Soviet ally, and would generally support the Soviet stance, although I\\'m not aware of them having specific issues with the Khmer Rouge beyond that. Interestingly, Cuba had tens of thousands of troops at the time in Angola supporting the Peoples Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA, which has actually ruled the country since 1975, although they stopped being Marxist-Leninist in 1991) and were fighting the US-backed UNITA rebels. Interestingly, UNITA was funded by the People\\'s Republic of China before switching to US and South African support. Another example of how communist states in the 1970s were far from aligned with each other would be Ethiopa and Somalia. By 1977 both were ruled by communist parties, and both even had Soviet advisors in-country. However, Somalia ended up invading Ethiopia in 1977 (starting the Ogaden War) in an attempt to conquer ethnically-Somali parts of the latter country. This led Cuba to send in tens of thousands of troops to support the Ethiopians and their Soviet advisors, while Somalia expelled its Soviet advisors, began taking aid from Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Italy, and by 1981 from the US and China as well. Realpolitik, alliance systems, and a general \"the enemy of my enemy is my friend\" definitely trumped ideological concerns between states in this period.',\n",

       " 'First, some links to older answers I wrote that might be of interest: - What happened to the Soviet army and police in Russia after 1991 - What happened to the Communist Party and their property in Russia in 1991 - What happened to the Soviet UN Security Council membership For an add-on - Russia wasn\\'t technically \"formed\" after the Soviet collapse. The Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic was one of the 15 Soviet Socialist Republics in the USSR, and so it was always there as a constituent member republic from the USSR\\'s founding in 1922 to its dissolution. It\\'s a bit like a state in a federal system, but the USSR was what\\'s considered an \"asymmetric\" federal system: not only was the RSFSR huge compared to the other republics (in 1991 it was more than 3/4ths of Soviet territory and more than half of its population), but it actually lacked a number of institutions other republics had, such as a republican communist party and KGB. In any case, as the Soviet government rapidly fell apart in late 1991, the RSFSR government more or less absorbed as much of those Soviet departments and institutions as it could, and what was left of the Soviet government ultimately shut down or resigned, with Soviet President Gorbachev resigning on December 25, 1991 and transferring his responsibilities (including nuclear codes) to Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Yeltsin (who had been head of the republican RSFSR government since 1990) was elected to the newly-created office of President of the RSFSR in June 1991, by the way. Just before Gorbachev resigned, the other soon-to-be former Soviet republics (not including the Baltics and Georgia) had signed the Alma-Ata Protocols, which established the Commonwealth of Independent States (a very loose international organization that replaced the USSR), and recognized the RSFSR as being, in effect, the legal successor to the USSR (assuming its UN seat and strategic control of its nuclear weapons, as well as Soviet debts). The RSFSR was very quickly renamed to the Russian Federation (as it is known today), but still operated under the (heavily amended) 1978 RSFSR constitution, complete with a Supreme Soviet legislature elected in 1990. This legislature and President Yeltsin entered into a protracted constitutional struggle with each other, that ultimately ended with Yeltsin having the Russian military shell the legislature in Moscow in 1993, and ultimately replace the constitution with a new one (still in force). Major economic reforms were undertaken from January 1992 onwards, but that\\'s another story.',\n",
       " \"The decision to prioritize Germany First actually predated Pearl Harbor and was based on the practical imperative of winning the war rather than the moral justification of entering the war. Anticipating that the U.S. would be drawn into the war, a strategy conference Called ABC-1 was held in Washington DC in January-March 1941, 12 months before Pearl Harbor. This conference was the place in which Anglo-American grand strategy was formulated. Subsequent events and discussions re-affirmed the overall grand strategy. The main reason for this strategy was that Germany was far more dangerous as an opponent for Britain and America. Firstly, the German industrial base alone was far stronger than Japan's and when the Italian effort is added in, Europe's importance is stronger still. Secondly the Germans were geographically much closer to Allied and Neutral industrial regions than the Japanese were. In 1941, Germany controlled territory within (or almost within) logistical striking distance of the industrial heartlands of the Soviet Union and Britain. If Nazi Germany were to knock out either the U.K. or U.S.S.R., it would cause the war to become dramatically more difficult for the Allies. Barbarossa in late 1941 made this situation even more compelling. The sooner the Anglo-Americans could make a contribution in Europe, the less chance there was of a Soviet collapse or an Eastern Front stalemate. In contrast, the largest Chinese industrial regions were already mostly controlled by Japan in 1941. Far Eastern colonies of the Allies were expendable in economic sense, because their resources were replaceable with substitutes like synthetic rubber, or other production sources. Due to logistical constraints, it was difficult for Japan to threaten the U.S. Mainland or Britain. Even secondary industrial centers like Australia and India were threatened only at the very end of long and tenuous supply lines, and serious invasion attempts proved impractical. Overall, the decision to focus on Europe was safer and more likely to bring an end to the war quickly than focusing on the Pacific. If I remember correctly, fewer troops were sent to the pacific than had died in Europe. This isn't true. The U.S. sent approximately 1,250,000 troops to the Pacific for the invasion of the Philippines alone, while the KIAs for the U.S. were only 407,316 for the war Source: Mark Harrison (ed.)

       " 'Greetings! I shall attempt to give my tuppence on this question, and I hope that other contributors with more specialised knowledge in the matter can delve into the rabbit holes I dig up a bit more. Firstly however, I would like to address some rather controversial claims you have put forward in the question. Firstly, what exactly do you mean by \"constant purges of the German army?\". Is there a particular event or figure you can point to regarding how many general or field officers Hitler dismissed prior to the war\\'s outbreak and in its course? The only event of considerable note that my past research has yielded is the Blomberg-Fritsch affair of 1938, which caused Hitler to gain full control of the Wehrmacht. Secondly, I would like to correct your somewhat egregious statement here: Authoritarian regimes always have incompetent militaries because personal loyalties are more important to a dictator than competence, while militaries of democracies have very competent militaries because personal loyalties don’t matter. There is a lot more to an army\\'s competence than the loyalty of its members. Quality of weapons and equipment, training, tactics, battlefield conditions, command structures, individual troop characteristics, size of the deployed force, and the list goes on for a while. I would really hazard against stating definitively that political loyalties are more important to success to every authoritarian state\\'s armed forces. If we take that maxim to be a general rule, then the case of Nazi Germany\\'s Wehrmacht in the opening stages of the Second World War or even the Soviet Union\\'s Red Army in the later stages of WW2 disprove it. On the other hand, democratic armies are not guaranteed to be \"very competent\" because political loyalties are not a major concern. Churchill for his part, was notorious in his support or disdain for members of the Navy, Air Force, and Army, and often it was his backing (or lack thereof) which initiated command changes in entire theaters. He notably backed Admiral Andrew Cunningham of the Mediterranean Command when Sir Claude Auchinlek and Air Officer Arthur Tedder attempted to remove him from his post.^ How an army fights is based on far more than its loyalty to the regime, presidency, or state which commands it. With that rather long preamble aside, let\\'s get started. Competent Commanders \"Where most states have an army, the Prussian army possesses a state.\" - Voltaire The Wehrmacht of the Second World War was not a new military phenomenon in Germany, or in the Prussian state which had united the nation in 1871. It was the latest iteration in the German armed forces, and it carried with it all the soldierly traditions of a nation whose militarist origins have been written about by many historians. Even before Hitler came to power in 1933, the Reichswehr which had come about due to the Treaty of Versailles began to immediately eschew these militaristic hallmarks which had allowed the Deutsches Heer to maintain a war on two fronts from 1914-18. As Christopher Chant rather nicely states: “The officers and men of the ‘hundred thousand army’ were taught to regard themselves as professionals– a hardcore force of experts, a functioning nucleus working for the future.”^ It was this basis of training which saw the German army undertake massive leaps in research and development in the 1920s and 30s. Perhaps the most striking advantage which the army gained was the tactical doctrine of Auftragstaktik (mission-type tactics), in which the individual soldier was taught how to take their own initiative in battle situations, and placed independence of command on officers without having to constantly seek approval from superiors.^ Even as early as 1931, one finds this doctrine at the heart of the German military, with an actual extract from the 1931 Germany Army Training Directions reading: ‘the individual soldier must be educated so that he is able to accomplish his tasks in battle even if left to himself. He must know that he alone is responsible for his acts and failures’^ Technologically, the Germans were also always abreast of the rapid developments in military technology, both within their corporations and in foreign nations. Most notable of these “foreign missions” was the German-Soviet Joint Tank development program, which lasted up until 1933 and is regarded historiographically as a major step in the development of what would later become the Blitzkrieg doctrine of the Wehrmacht.^ These pre-war efforts, accelerated with Hitler\\'s shift towards expansionism in 1936 onwards (alongside the preparations of the German military-industrial state), ensured that by September 1st, 1939, the Wehrmacht had grown to become a potent force.^ More on how it utilised such potency in the next part. When the war itself broke out, Hitler already had complete control of the Wehrmacht, by being the Commander-In-Chief of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, which was itself the top organization of the Heer (Army), Luftwaffe (Air Force), and Kriegsmarine (Navy) combined. In the early stages of the war and right up to its conclusion, the Army had in its ranks some of the most talented and capable commanders history has borne in such a short span of time: Panzer corps commanders Erwin Rommel, Heinz Guderian, Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist, Georg-Hans Reinhardt, and Erich Hoepner to name a few.^ These generals were often early proponents of mechanized warfare, and their tactics as leaders of the elite Panzergruppen and later Panzerarmee have been studied and applauded by military analysts/historians alike. Even though these commanders and their subordinates knew that it was political loyalty which could (and often did) ultimately dictate who got the boot and who remained in the field, their professionalism and talent time and time again showed Hitler how invaluable they were to maintain. So to end the first bit of my response to your question, I’ll let Christopher Chant drive home the point on the Wehrmacht\\'s leadership: “In the last analysis it is safe to say that the combined armies of Great Britain, the British Dominions and Empire, the United States and the Soviet Union put together failed to produce so rich a crop of highly talented generals as boasted by the German army alone. The achievements of Hitler’s generals in the field were formidable enough. That they managed to achieve anything in the face of Hitler’s megalomania was positively astonishing.”^ Coming tomorrow: The Lightning Strikes Sources: 1: Lambert, Andrew D.

       " 'In the previous comments I explored the role of the competent commanders, prewar preparations, emphasis on surprise, and the general inferiority of the Allied powers which led to the Wehrmacht\\'s early successes in the 1939-40 period. We must now turn our gaze east, and to quote the Fuhrer who remained ever distrustful of his commanders (but acknowledged their brilliance): \"We terminate the endless German drive to the south and the west of Europe, and direct our gaze towards the lands in the East... If we talk about new soil and territory in Europe today, we can think primarily only of Russia and its vassal border states.\" Again, a reminder that this response (in tandem with the others) is meant to serve as a general overview of the campaign in Russia from 1941 to 1942, as your question (rather thankfully) has narrowed the chronological scope down to those years. A more exhaustive analysis of the Wehrmacht\\'s performance and the Red Army\\'s initial failures requires further reading, hence I shall plug the AskHistorians reading list on the Eastern Front to help get you started on that venture if it interests you. With all that said, let us now pick up where we left off and round off this trilogy of responses. It\\'s been a most enjoyable journey, and I can only hope that more people find the overview here helpful (shameless preachy rhetoric there, but if I may be allowed it for brief moment). Red Beard, Red Army, Red Flag Similar sources to the comments above The origins of Hitler\\'s campaign of conquest shifting from the West to the East resides in several factors. First we have the rhetoric he presented in Mein Kampf and built up in subsequent publications/speeches, the idea of lebensraum (living space) for the greater German volk (people). Even before the Battle of Britain had gone into full swing, Hitler was already considering what to do with the USSR. Of course, he had technically entered Germany into a non-aggression Pact with the Soviets (the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact) and that technically meant that Germany could not declare war on the Soviets, but Hitler had always expressed a desire for something to come out of Russia, and that \"something\" is described rather well by Chant below: \"Russia must be dismembered so that the ‘Slavic sub-humans’ might be put in their correct place as underlings of the master-race, so that communism might be stamped out as a threat to national-socialism, and so that the German race might possess the necessary Lebensraum or living space in the east, together with its enormous potential in foodstuffs and industrial raw materials, not to mention oil. As always, this last item was well to the front of all Hitler’s thinking.\" But Britain was proving to be a tougher nut to crack than Hitler and his general had foreseen. The Luftwaffe were bombing British airfields (and later towns) day after day, but the RAF continued their stubborn resistance against the stream of bombers that flew out across the Channel from airbases in German-occupied France. This comment again will not go too far into the course and eventual consequences of that Battle on its own, so I highly recommend cementing at least some foundational understanding of the Luftwaffe’s failures against the RAF. For the purpose of this response, the key consequence is that the Battle of Britain brought the Soviet Union to the forefront of Hitler’s concerns regarding the course of the war. On the one hand, he could choose to maintain co-operative relations with the Soviets, who for their part were rather willing to fulfil German demands for food and minerals. On the other however, by 1940 Roosevelt had decided that American resources were best directed to defend British independence, which posed a new threat on the horizon to Hitler. If the Red Army could be destroyed in a single campaign and the Soviet resources brought under German control, the Third Reich could face the eventual Anglo-American alliance with greater confidence and attritional resistance. However, this all rested on the key assumption: if the Soviets could be taken out in one campaign. To that end, Hitler approved the plans for Operation Barbarossa (red beard, after a highly respected Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire) on December 13th, 1940. Preparations were to be completed by May 15th, 1941 and the main plan envisioned three powerful thrusts. More on that in a moment, because we must first take into account the sheer scale of this venture. In the Low Countries, the Wehrmacht had deployed some 91 divisions over a front of about 965 kilometers (600 miles), against the might of the Red Army, they deployed 146 divisions, along a front of 2092 kilometers (about 1,300 miles) in length. The Red Army divisions facing them in June 1941 totaled some 150 divisions, though most were understrength and the whole Soviet armed forces was still suffering from something the original question has brought up: Stalin’s Purges. It is not true that the Wehrmacht had suffered as equally by Hitler’s hand before the war as the Red Army has. The Blomberg-Fritsch affair I mentioned earlier stands out, but that only saw the removal of 2 commanders. By contrast, the Red Army’s top brass had been absolutely decimated between 1938-39. In the Red Army alone, the purges had eliminated: 3 out of 5 marshals (among them the renowned Mikhail Tukhachevsky), 50 out of 57 corps commanders, and 154 out of 186 divisional commanders. A new batch of officers and generals was being trained, but these men would take time to grasp the intricacies of mechanized warfare. The Soviet equipment, on the other hand, was also a mixed bag. Though they had 20,000 tanks at the onset of the invasion, more than three-quarters were unserviceable. 1,500 KV-1s and T-34s (both of which were shockingly superior to any German panzers of the time and impenetrable to all but the heaviest field guns) had been deployed, but these formations lacked radios and were inexperienced. The Soviet Air Forces had about 8,000 planes, but most were old designs and crewed by pilots who had yet to face the battle-hardened Luftwaffe. Soviet artillery on the other hand, was a formidable enemy if encountered, though in June 1941 they were still suffering from the purges as well. Barbarossa was formed of a three-pronged thrust into the Soviet heartlands, striking at key cities such as Leningrad, Moscow, and Kiev, as well as seizing the Caucasus oilfields in the south. The first target was entrusted to generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb’s Heeresgruppe Nord (Army Group North), formed of six mobile and twenty-three infantry divisions. Kiev was entrusted to generalfeldmarschall Gerd von Rundstedt’s Heeresgruppe Sud (Army Group Center), formed of eight mobile and thirty-three infantry divisions (among them some Romanian divisions). The prize of the Soviet capital however, fell to generalfeldmarschall Fedor von Bock’s Heeresgruppe Mitte (Army Group Centre), formed of fifteen mobile divisions and thirty five infantry divisions. Among the troops under Bock’s command were the 2nd and 3rd Panzergruppen of Erich von Manstein and Hermann Hoth, two of the most battle-hardened and well-equipped contingents in the entire force. The general tactics were similar to those which had worked so well in the West: mass encirclements of Soviet forces enabling swift strikes towards key points. However, the critical factor here, was supply. The encirclements were planned to take place as close as possible to the Western border as possible, enabling the resupply and reinforcement of the various army groups to sustain the campaign. It was this critical factor which soon shot the bolt of the entire Russian campaign. On June 22nd, after a crucial month’s delay at Hitler’s insistence to deal with Yugoslavia and Greece, the operation was launched. In the first few weeks, all three Army Groups made spectacular progress. By July 13th, some 4 million Red Army troops had been killed, wounded, or captured. The Wehrmacht had pushed the borders of the Third Reich as much as 800 kilometers (600 miles) further. Massive encirclements of hundreds of thousands of troops had taken place around Bialystok, Minsk, Kiev, Kharkov, and Vyazma (not including the countless smaller encirclements of sub-division formations). Chief of staff general Franz Halder remarked in his diary on July 3rd: “It is thus in light of the success of the invasion probably no overstatement to say that the Russian Campaign has been won in the space of two weeks. However, the sheer geographical vastness of the country and the stubbornness of the resistance, which is carried on with all means, will claim our efforts for many more weeks to come.”',\n",
       " 'The Lightning Strikes In the previous comment I touched on how the interwar years were a hive of activity, R&D, and general preparation for the Germany Army (even before the ascent of Hitler as a dictator in 1933). Though I highly recommend you look more into specific historical analyses of the German army’s command strengths (especially if you are particularly interested in a certain Panzerarmee or infantry commander), the key takeaway from Part 1 was that despite the undeniable importance of loyalty to the Nazi regime and Hitler as Fuhrer, the Prussian sense of militarism had already been distilled into an incredibly competent group of generals who oversaw the early years of the war. This part of the response will go more in-depth (though by no means is it complete or exhaustive in that effort) on the tactics that the Wehrmacht employed, and why that enabled it to win a swathe of successes in the 1939-41 campaigns. Firstly however, we must acknowledge that elephant in the room. The very heading of this part is a nod to that inescapable word when studying the German military during the Second World War: Blitzkrieg (Lightning War). Most textbooks, tertiary sources, and even documentaries (though “pop-history” ones at that) ascribe the success of the Wehrmacht to this “radical” new style of warfare, which emphasized rapid and sudden attacks by concentrated formations on a weak point, followed by envelopment of the opposing forces and eventual annihilation of them.^ This entire concept however, is a myth. It’s now widely known in historiographical circles (even mores after the writings of Richard Overy and Williamson Murray in the 1970s). The term itself is actually an Allied creation, in that it was actually the Anglo-American Press which coined the term and used it with such frequency in the immediate post-war historiography. J.P Harris on this odd paradox: “Those who made the Third Reich’s military plans and organized its war economy appear rarely, if ever, to have employed the term Blitzkrieg in official documents. Nor was any equivalent official term used which carried all or even most of the meanings and connotations with which Blitzkrieg has been endowed by English-language writers.”^ Without going into too much of the debate here, the essence of it all is that Blitzkrieg was not the concerted effort of mechanized troops and Panzers which is often pictured when hearing the word. Instead, Blitzkrieg (if one can even use the term) referred to the Germany Army’s preference for fast, and short campaigns, which during the Second World War was launched though the use of Panzergruppen and the Luftwaffe’s “Flying Artillery”.^ So, let’s take a closer look at the Poland Campaign and how this tactic really unfolded on the battlefield. The Polish Army in September 1939 consisted of thirty regular infantry divisions, ten reserve divisions, eleven brigades of horsed cavalry and one armored brigade.^ Facing them from Germany and East Prussia were fifty-five German divisions. Twenty-four of them were infantry divisions in the so-called “first-wave”, regular soldiers and the best reservists. Fifteen were infantry of regular cadres and younger reservists, whilst the sixteen divisions were composed of six new Panzergruppen and ten fully mechanized infantry.4 Importantly however, the Germans had overwhelming superiority in the air, with over 2,000 modern aircraft crewed by well-trained Luftwaffe pilots decimating the 600 obsolete Polish aircraft.^ In truth, the German campaign was not spearheaded by the lightning-fast and precise Blitzkrieg strikes which is often detailed. Instead, the Panzers were deployed in a dispersed manner, aiming to overrun key communication points, supply lines, and defenses.^ Further, the use of East Prussia as an actual launch point for the invasion was a stroke of genius, as it not only gave the Polish defenders more to worry about, but presented a golden opportunity for encirclements. To this regard, the Wehrmacht assigned the 3rd and 4th Armies of Generaloberst Feodor von Bock’s Heeresgruppe Nord (Army Group North) the duty of the East Prussia sector. The 4th Army would attack from East Germany into the Danzig Corridor, linking up with the 4th Army (which would itself also split into two to attack various other cities from East Prussia).^ The campaign was a complete success, and all resistance had crumbled by the 17th (the same date the USSR launched its invasion of Eastern Poland).^ Stephen Fritz on the success of this first Wehrmacht offensive. “Although their tanks compared favorably with German Panzer Is and IIs, the Poles had few of them and, most damaging, were completely deficient in terms of number and quality of aircraft. The Poles were also hurt by Allied pressure to delay their mobilization so as not to provoke a German attack, an action that seemed to corroborate Hitler’s perception that the British, especially, still hoped to avoid war.”^ Against France and Britain in the 1940 campaigns however, the Germans would not be able to take advantage of numerical or even materiel superiority. The French fielded the equivalent of 91 divisions in the Spring of 1940, and their tanks (namely the H-35, H-39s, and Char-Bs) were in many respects the equivalent (and in some ways better) than the already aging Panzer I and IIs that were still in some of the Panzergruppen.^ The British for their part, contributed ten infantry divisions in the British Expeditionary Force, which was for the most under equipped and poorly trained.^ The Luftwaffe once again outnumbered and outgunned the combined British, French, Belgian, and Dutch air forces and the presence of radio in every element of the now elite Panzer divisions (as opposed to the lack of it in the Anglo-French ones) meant that the Germans had a slight upper edge troop-wise.^ The real competence and brilliance of the Wehrmacht in this campaign however (known as Fall Gelb, or Case Yellow), was in choosing where and when to strike. You have probably read already about how Manstein’s Panzers bypassed the Maginot Line by way of the Ardennes Forest and surprised the Allied forces, who (some less reputable tertiary sources claim), had not expected such an attack. This final note is egregiously wrong: the Allied planners had already envisioned such an attack through Belgium, and the French high command had discussed in detail their Army’s plans for such a maneuver. General Gamelin, the supreme Allied commander, pushed for what the French called “Plan D”, in which a German attack would be met with a defensive line on the River Dyle from Wavre to Louvain and Antwerp, and then onto a line on the Meuse River from Namur to Sedan.^ The Wehrmacht plan consisted of a two-pronged assault involving Army Group A and B (under the command of Gerd von Rundstedt and Feodor von Bock respectively). Army Group A was made the larger army in an insightful decision by Erich von Manstein and Rundstedt (wihich Hitler supported), as this was the group which contained the armoured spearhead of seven Panzer and three motorized divisions (alongside other formations, it totaled some 44 divisions).^ The Germans achieved surprise with their attack, and the French centralization of Command, as well as general incompetence by its commanders, meant that the campaign progressed with unexpected speed. R.A.C Parker on Fall Gelb: “In war between comparable forces victory goes to the side which suffers fewer delays and confusions and in which the chain of command is more lucid and effective. The best French troops and their equipment and morale were fully equal to those of the best German troops. They were defeated because too often they were not in the right place at the right time.”^ So in addition to its use of armored divisions and rapid maneuvers, the German Army made such short work of the 1939-40 campaigns against roughly equal Allied armies due to its superior command structure (or lack thereof, recall the Auftragstaktik from the previous part) and mastering the art of surprise. Though behind the scenes Hitler had quarreled with many commanders in the lead-up to these campaigns, he could not deny their effectiveness and professional merit by the time Paris had fallen. Competence and brilliance in the Wehrmacht came before blind political loyalty, and the generals who scythed their way through Poland, France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands were exemplary at the former, often making up for their deficiencies in the latter.

       " 'Just to add my two cents: Authoritarian regimes always have incompetent militaries because personal loyalties are more important to a dictator than competence, while militaries of democracies have very competent militaries because personal loyalties don’t matter. While u/Starwarsnerd has already addressed it, I would like to get back to this point: as any other as any other black-and-white notion about history this one is very far from truth: The French army of the Third Republic since it creation in 1871 till its fall in 1940 was plagued by the problem of loyalty-based vs merit-based promotions. The civil government of the republic was constantly in fear of some form of Bonapartism military coup toppling the democratic government and establishing the Third Empire, while the constant threat of the another German aggression and the revanchism forced the government to maintain potent and powerful military. This resulted in very complicated and troublesome relationship of government and army of the Republic. The officer cadre of the army became heavily factionalised into numerous groups of Republicans, Patriots and Careerists and promotion of young officer almost always required the patronage of some higher-up civil or military official which even further contributed to the formation of various cliques around the most influential officials. This \"ghost of Bonapartism\" did not wane even after Genera Boulanger\\'s attempt to seize power has failed. This problem has only worsened in the interwar period. The pacifist sentiment of the lost generation combined with the global economic crisis has forced the government to be very stingy about the military budget. Simultaneously the cases of militaries of Italy, Spain and Germany actively supporting the nationalist anti-democratic coups combined with the growing nationalist movement in France itself has renewed the old fear of Bonapartism. The overall political and ministerial instability of the Third Republic has only exacerbated the importance of military leadership’s loyalty. The question of the size of officer and professional NCO cadre became a political one closely controlled by the parliament and its enlargement was always very heavily opposed by the left politicians. The government has took proactive steps in preventing the formation of professional army: the conscription service was shortened in order to prevent the formation of ties between the commanders and their soldiers while the field training and manoeuvres were heavily restricted. De Gaulle\\'s 1934 Towards a Professional Army was criticized by the Left who believed that professional army would inevitably take down the democratic government and seize power for the fascists. All of this resulted in French officers being in general very incompetent and sometimes even comically inept at the simple communications and manoeuvring because they never had commanded their units in the field before the war. So, to conclude we have an example of the army of the probably most democratic country of Europe being endemically plagued by the same problem you\\'ve attributed to the dictatorships. Another example to prove this was the Spanish civil war: both Nationalist and republican armies included forces from a wide spectrum of political allegiances, but the Francists almost never had a problem of loyalty and trust in their commanders during the war while for the Republicans it was a constant factor they had to keep in mind.',\n",
       " 'I\\'m afraid the premise of your question is wrong. Ares was in no sense the \"Spartan god\". Like the Athenians and all other Greek communities, the Spartans worshipped a wide range of Greek deities, as I\\'ve outlined in this older post The most prominent divinities of Sparta were Apollo, the Dioskouroi (Castor and Pollux), Artemis Orthia, and Athena. Like all Greek states, they seem to have had a minor cult to Ares, but this god was no more prominent at Sparta than he was anywhere else. Ares was a force of chaotic violence that was propitiated to keep him away, not invoked to bring him close. If the Spartans wished to invoke a deity of war, their preferred choice was either Herakles (alleged ancestor of their royal lines) or Enyalios, the Dorian war god.',\n",
       " \"The northern border (along with the western border) was ill-defined in the original treaty, in a large part because both areas were almost entirely unknown to European sources. Jefferson primarily viewed the purchase as a way of acquiring sovereignty over New Orleans, and with it, the Mississippi. Everything else was, essentially, gravy. You can get an idea for how little clarity there was on this topic from the 1803 treaty document In particular, this paragraph is the closest the negotiators got to geographically defining the nature of the territory: His Catholic Majesty promises and engages on his part to cede to the French Republic six months after the full and entire execution of the conditions and Stipulations herein relative to his Royal Highness the Duke of Parma, the Colony or Province of Louisiana with the Same extent that it now has in the hand of Spain, & that it had when France possessed it; and Such as it Should be after the Treaties subsequently entered into between Spain and other States. The fact that they spend multiple articles describing the disposition of public buildings, fortifications, and river navigability, and almost nothing about the wilderness frontier of the purchase, tells you almost everything you need to know of what they were primarily thinking about. That's not to say it didn't matter, though, hence the organization of expeditions specifically tasked with shedding some light onto the extent and nature of the territory (the Corps of Discovery under Lewis and Clark being the most famous of these). The US interpretation of the treaty was that it represented the entire drainage basin of the Mississippi lying west of the river. In modern terms, this would encompass an area which carves off about half of North Dakota, roughly two-thirds of Minnesota, most of Montana, and a sliver of what is now Alberta and Saskatchewan. You can get a general idea of what this would have meant by looking at the hydrological basins of North America. Wikipedia has a nice high-level one with the green line and purple lines roughly denoting the northern reach of the territory. Of course, none of this was known in such detail (or anything close to it) at the time. And even the interpretation of the purchase as denoting the entire Mississippi basin was bitterly contested by Spain and England. It would need another 16 years and two additional treaties before the matter was essentially settled, and (among other things) the northern boundary of what we now know as Montana, Minnesota, and the Dakotas was fixed along the line that we now recognize.\",\n",
       " \"I'll throw in my two cents. I study and write on what is perhaps (one of?) the worst movements to ever arise in human history. For the answers I write here, I have to dig through aggregate data involving the loss of millions of people and on essentially every page of National Socialist history there is at least one war crime. Yes, this is true. But I also have the benefit of hindsight and a generational perspective. I have the hope for justice that is the Nuremburg Trials; I have the assurance that the Soviets and the Allies will very soon come crashing down upon the Reich's insidious machine. History tends to take a large scale, statistical perspective but I always try to maintain that there are real people involved in all of this. I look for the human stories: the diaries, the children growing up in the midst of war, the kindness of humanity helping to hide Jews and political prisoners. For every terrible man like Goebbels or Heydrich, I find several stories of hope. Kindness and humanity does not make for juicy news and reporting, whether that's today or generations (or centuries) back. Historians want to remember and write what is interesting, and that is most often the atrocities. I'm also more than a little morbid and find things like a bush-whacking guerilla army of anti-fascist & anti-Nazi partisans to be genuinely pleasing to the soul. So all in all, it's the surety of justice and the morbid pleasure of seeing war criminals shot by the people they persecute that motivates me.\",\n",
       " 'The era I study has been heavily romanticized over centuries with novels and movies, Liu Bei and his sworn brothers fighting to restore the beloved Han and defying the power, the valiant warriors of flawed nobility, sage minds who commanded the heavens. In truth, it was a brutal civil war that lasted nearly 100 years, there were massacres, murders (and murderers being rewarded with high positions due to being useful), famines, cannibalism, bigotry, families separated, wrongful executions, kidnapping, ladies paying dearly for the loss of husband\\'s affections (or being forced into bigamy), bigotry. Even unification would not bring peace for long. Yet in the era there was an advancement in medicine, inventions, history, philosophy, literature, there was major economic development of the south which went from place of exile to a powerful part of China thanks to the Wu dynasty. There was suffering and that should never be neglected or waved away, but there many who strived to better things via such ideas or via bringing in agricultural colonies to end the famines, to take on the problems of their generation and they had seen in the past. The bad side is also not the only thing there. There was humour and jokes, friendship, love, mourning deeply because they hurt, people striving to make a difference, kindness, silliness. Sure I could focus on all the cruelties but I always remember the lighter side, the human side. The moment Liu Bei\\'s old friend Jian Yong (who was not one for obeying etiquette) got a law changed by ridiculing it in a carriage ride, Cao Cao\\'s words about the youngest of his inner circle Guo Jia for whom he hoped to entrust his future but who died young and sharing his grief with his friends. Sun Quan arguing with his old adviser Zhang Zhao and swords being drawn but then weeping into his old mentor\\'s arms. There are many such moments, where the human side, it\\'s pettiness and it\\'s sweetness comes to the fore in sweet and amusing moments. Where tragedy also sees love and pain because it hurt, because we are humans and we grieve. Or the mighty warrior Lu Bu, a man famed for his disloyalty to allies, killer of two masters, arrogant, sometimes a bully, a man accused of sleeping with the wives of his officers. Yet the moment I often remember of him is, as his last stronghold was flooded and the city fell as officers defected, he climbed up a gate tower and saw it was over. He turned to his servants and told them to kill him, to get the reward that would come with his head, none would do so. He was a flawed man in so many ways yet at the moment when his career, and soon life, was over, he was capable of something like that. Yes, I see the brutality and the ugliness that humanity can bring but I also see the kindness, the warmth, the pain because life hurts, the little human moments between friends and rivals, the humour of people relaxed, the \"I regret what I said last night\". The moments where people showed the best sides of themselves in a moment of understanding for another. Moments that, in different ways, we all share in some way or another and I see people striving to make their world a better place as best they knew how. That brings a smile to my face and hope as I myself hope to bring a little bit of kindness and make the world, even if just a little, a better place.',\n",
       " 'My own tuppence on this most interesting question. My area of expertise encompasses two of the most brutal, bloody, and terrifying conflicts in the history of our race. In the course of my research I\\'ve seen photos of combatants with all innocence gone from their eyes, the atrocities committed by both sides in the pursuit of victory, and the destruction wrought on our planet\\'s own face. In short, I find truth in the words of Arthur Koestler: \"The most persistent sound which reverberates through man’s history is the beating of war drums.\" But as the other comments have highlighted for their own contexts, for every dark event there is always a brighter one to be found. In the case of the world wars, I\\'m also reassured by the benefit of hindsight and generations of progress. I know now that for each Nazi victory in the early stages, there will be a more decisive Allied one to come. I know that the Treaty of Versailles, as flawed as it was, was written by the just victors of the Great War. I know that despite the horrors of mass genocide and death, there will be an end to the killing and justice shall find its mark. I also however, gain motivation by asking the simple Socratic question: why? Humans were not bred (as far as I am concerned) to spark destruction and take the lives of their own kind, so war as a whole is a uniquely human phenomenon that has unfortunately plagued the record of civilisations. How did our societies come to blows over the most varied (and at times trivial) of causes? There is always more to be found out about the past in my view, and that is the singular maxim which drives me in my research and writings. Now on the more preachy side of things, the old cliche of \"those who fail to learn history are doomed to repeat it\" is not something I stand by. Drawing parallels between events happening now and a century ago is dangerously single-minded in my opinion. The optimism gained in knowing more about the past and keeping that record as an evolving narrative is instead, I believe a better reason for my continued positive outlook on the world. So all this being said, at the end of the day, I find more truth in Aristotle\\'s quote than Koestlers: We make war that we may live in peace.',\n",

This has lead from the study of censorship of books and book burning which can be anything from contemporary attempts to ban Lord of the Rings in the Bible Belt of the USA to the Nazi book burning to the burning of the library at Sarajevo during the Bosnian War. I take the philosophical view that everything is worth study and by studying and analysing these books, are a way of trying to acknowledge it happened. Why do I study it? If I know the history of these books I can care for them better thus honouring the lives these books contributed in destroying or lost as a result of. As to the study of censorship and book burning, It is attributed to Sir Frances Bacon “power is knowledge” and how does one gain knowledge historically through books. If these atrocities are not studied I worry they will be forgotten and allowed to continue, which is still happening. How do I find happiness? Some of the early printed torahs are the most beautiful books I’ve ever seen, how the type is designed to how the page is laid out, one takes the good with the bad.

       " 'There\\'s more that could be said, but allow me to paste in a previous answer of mine ... The road is long and winding! It begins with Gothic architecture, although this is something of an incidental step. Gothic architecture, developed and used from the High Middle Ages through the Renaissance, was characterized by an impression of narrowness and height; buildings in the Gothic style managed to be higher and narrower than earlier, Romanesque ones through the use of the slender and pointed Gothic or ogival arch, clusters of slender columns, and flying buttresses (basically, the skeleton of an arch, placed perpendicularly to a wall in order to support it). During the Early Modern period, the humanities and sciences of the Middle Ages - then conceived of as a savage \"dark age\" between the enlightened eras of the Roman Empire and the classically-inspired Renaissance - were typically rated on a scale from \"utterly barbaric\" to \"less barbaric, but still barbaric\", and by the time Batty Langley wrote Ancient Architecture, Restored, and Improved in 1742, this style was seen as \"coarse\" and \"artless\" and needed to be rehabilitated; where today we see it as having important feats of engineering, it was then generally considered to be ugliness incarnate essentially derived from the loss of culture caused by the destruction of Rome by the (see?) Visigoths. As the love of Classical art and architecture built up to an extreme at the end of the eighteenth century, however, people started to see a good side to not just the Middle Ages, but a wilder and less pared-down aesthetic in general, and \"Gothic\" came to take on a new connotation. For instance, Richard Hurd\\'s 1762 Letters on Chivalry and Romance described Edmund Spenser\\'s The Faerie Queen, written and published at the end of Queen Elizabeth I\\'s reign, as a \"Gothic poem\". The English started to see the Gothic era as one characterized by, well, chivalry and romance, and particularly important to their country\\'s history, taking it from a degenerate period to one with important figures to remember and a tradition worth reviving. And it certainly was revived. In architecture, the Gothic style was being used from the time of Langley, above (that\\'s what he was writing for - he also published a book of designs for Gothic architecture and interior design and exploded in a big way in the early nineteenth century. The Lake Poets, led by William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Robert Southey, took inspiration from medieval and English Renaissance literature, and were sometimes referred to as poets of the \"second Gothic\". Sir Walter Scott was an early adopter of the fascination with the medieval in both fiction and poetry; his early poems, The Lay of the Last Minstrel and The Lady of the Lake , were set in Scotland in the sixteenth century, and he also wrote a number of historical novels. I must also mention that women\\'s fashion was moving away from the Neoclassical and making many references to medieval and Renaissance dress, with slashed sleeves, starched white ruffs, and fuller skirts. Outside of England, others were responding to the same impulses against Neoclassical rationality: the German Sturm und Drang, the American Hudson River School and Transcendentalist philosophers. All of this together - the historical settings and references, and the love of untamed nature - is also known as the Romantic movement. Gothic/Romantic artwork was lush and wild; novels were full of the kind of excitement that modern people living in the prosaic Industrial Revolution felt was gone from the world. This movement also saw the invention of the historical reenactment: a full-on medieval tournament was put on by the Earl of Eglinton in 1839, and several years later, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert held a bal costumé where the pair dressed as Philippa of Hainault and Edward III and encouraged guests to also dress from the same period. Romanticism faded away from popularity, not to return again until members of the hippie counter culture in the late 1960s adopted long, flowing skirts, peasant blouses, and long hair on both men and women. This was soon co-opted by the fashion industry, leading to a more mainstream take in the early 1970s. (Think Laura Ashley and Gunne Sax, cravats and ascots, those men\\'s shirts with ruffles down the front.) The New Romantics of the 1980s - Spandau Ballet, Boy George, et al. - then took this to an extreme, as did Vivienne Westwood in her 1981 \"Pirate\" collection, with \"puffy shirts\" and eighteenth-century-style jackets. Another aspect of the Romantic era, one which persisted through the late nineteenth century, was an interest in the dark, mysterious, and supernatural. Mary Shelley\\'s Frankenstein , for instance, is a classic Gothic horror story; The Monk and The Mysteries of Udolpho , two Gothic novels referenced in Jane Austen\\'s Gothic parody Northanger Abbey, were also classics of the genre and featured evil villains, persecuted innocents, and a lot of implausible but exciting situations happening in dark castles. This is the meaning of \"Gothic\" that the twentieth century goths were drawing from. The modern gothic subculture began with gothic rock artists and fans, an offshoot of punk that started in 1979-80, and then went on to combine with the style of the New Romantics - like goth rock and punk, both a musical and a fashionable movement. Goths pulled from Victorian clothing, wearing black PVC corsets, velvet, lace, and high boots; they also added a lot of crosses in jewelry and tattoos, ripped fishnet stockings, and of course a heavy use of pale foundation and black makeup, none of which were really in use in the nineteenth century. Modern goths are a post-modern pastiche of the people involved in the literary Gothic movement, many steps removed from the original ancient Europeans.

       " 'The specifics depend on exactly when and where in medieval Europe you\\'re talking about. I have a few past answers that may help you understand some of the changes in medieval fashion: Arts, Crafts, and Clothes of a 5th/6th century Saxon? Why did the tunic fall out of favor in Europe? Why did men largely stop wearing dress/skirt style clothing while women continued to do so? Bonjour, I\\'m a noblewoman in France during the High Middle Ages, what would I wear to court and in my everyday life? How did women cover their hair in Europe (especially England) in the Middle Ages/Renaissance? When it comes to servants vs. peasants, I\\'m not really sure there\\'s the distinction you\\'re imagining. I know that \"livery\" was a concept, at least in the later Middle Ages, but my understanding is that it refers essentially to a general clothing provision, possibly in a specific color/fabric, but not so much a uniform that distinguished itself from other clothing in terms of both cut and fabric (like a modern hotel maid\\'s outfit). What you\\'re finding about \"peasant\" clothing is most likely relevant to the majority of servants, though better-off servants in higher positions would have access to better fabrics and more up-to-date cuts. (And although the two representative pieces you link are VERY vague about time and place and are generalizing too much.) I would suggest taking a look at Textiles and Clothing, 1150-1450 and Shoes and Pattens: Finds from Medieval Excavations in London, two publications from the Museum of London that go into exhaustive detail on their subjects. The King\\'s Servants and The Queen\\'s Servants from The Tudor Tailor are specific to the late 15th and early 16th centuries (and it looks like they have a book called The Typical Tudor coming out next month that will be exactly what you\\'re looking for as well). Fashion in the Age of the Black Prince: A Study of the Years 1340-1365 is another very good book, specific to a different period (one in which some big changes were occurring).

       " 'The applicable Army Regulation here is AR 615-360 \"Enlisted Men: Discharge; Release From Active Duty\". The original regulation was dated 26 November 1942. There were thirteen sections in total. The regulation was revised in 1945, resulting in ten separate regulations 615-360 to 615-369, which replaced the original sections. Each section details exactly when such a discharge applies, as well as they type of discharge by form. Honorable discharges are white, other than honorable are blue, and dishonorable discharges are yellow. Section I covers standard discharges, known as \"Expiration of Term of Service\", or ETS. Section II Disability - Fairly self-explanatory. It outlines the process of discharging disabled soldiers and transfer to the VA system, as well as eligibility for a pension. Of note, however, that insanity is explicitly covered in this section, not Section VIII. Section III Purchase - During peacetime, a soldier could buy out his enlistment for a price based on his length of service. Section IV Minority - Minority applies to soldiers under the age of 18. Soldiers under the age of 16, when discovered, have their case reviewed by the appropriate service command and directed for retention or discharge under this section. Those 16 or 17 may be granted discharge by application of the parent or guardian (not by his own application). Section V Dependency - Dependency discharges were for soldiers who had responsibility of care for immediate family members due to the death or disability of another family member. (Since we\\'re talking Section VIII, made famous by MASH\\'s Corporal Klinger, this is the type of discharge that Radar O\\'Reilly was granted to care for his mother). Section VI Fraudulent Enlistment or Induction - This means the soldier either had previously deserted from another service (Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard), was previously convicted of certain heinous crimes, concealed a previous conviction upon enlistment, or was on parole or probation for any crime, unless such parole or probation is terminated or suspended for his military enlistment. Also includes fraudulent enlistment of aliens not eligible for enlistment. Section VII Desertion - This is an interesting one, because it is for deserters who are caught, but who are found unfit for service, either physically or mentally. They may be discharged instead of court martialed. Section VIII Inaptness or Undesirable Habits or Traits of Character - This covers more than just insanity. It refers to an enlisted man who \"Is inapt\" or \"Does not possess the required degree of adaptability for the military service after reasonable attempts have been made to reclassify and reassign such an enlisted man in keeping with his abilities...\", \"Gives evidence of habits or traits of character (except when discharge for physical or mental conditions is indicated as provided in Section III), or finally \"Is disqualified for service...through his own misconduct\". Furthermore, it states \"No man will be separated...unless the Government can obtain no useful service from him...\". Which implies if you do your assigned duties, even while wearing a dress, you aren\\'t going to be discharged! However, this section was also used to discharge LGBT soldiers, often with a blue (other than honorable) discharge. Section IX Conviction By Civil Court - It is \"within their discretion to discharge enlisted men who during their term of service, have been finally convicted by a civil court of an offense, the nature of which clearly indicates that the individual is not a suitable person to associate with enlisted men.\", or convicted of certain heinous crimes of treason, murder, rape, kidnapping, arson, sodomy, or pandering; or any crime involving sex perversion; or for any illegal dealing in narcotics...\" (Pandering, in this case, would be classified as Sex Trafficking). Section X Convenience of Government - This isn\\'t a great as it sounds. This section is enlisted men who obtain a direct commission as an officer, or a appointment as a warrant officer. Since they are no longer \\'enlisted\\' their term of enlistment is ended and any obligation is discharged. Section XI Writ of Habeas Corpus - A US court may order the discharge of an enlisted soldier. Section XII Dishonorable - A soldier may be dishonorably discharged as a result of a court martial. Section XIII Retained For Medical Care or Hospitalization - A soldier who has reached the end of his enlistment, but still requires medical care may be retained, usually up to 6 months.',\n",
       " \"When Caesar died Octavian was relatively unknown, he wasn't even in Rome when Caesar passed and it took time for him to simultaneously be told Caesar was dead and Octavian was his heir. Caesar had the popular support of the people and Antony played that up big time to further turn public support away from the conspirators. There were those, Antony included, who saw Antony as the natural heir to Caesar and weren't best pleased at the upstart. Octavian had been well-schooled, but his best chance for any military experience had been thwarted by personal illness and his political roles had been minor. Antony was less the policitian, but he was a brilliant military leader and very charismatic. Lepidus never got Antony's fame but he also acted as a kind of deputy to Caesar and potentially was seen as more reliable than the reckless Antony. He marshaled his own forces after the death of Caesar but was urged to maintain peace. Lepidus and Antony both requested the Senate continue to acknowledge their offices and Caesar's reforms in exchange for them not pursuing the assassins of Caesar. But Antony ended up taking an army to Gaul, Lepidus was ordered to go after him. Lepidus wasn't about it, and Antony was defeated at Mutina by a force that included Octavian. Octavian was there to fight because he was 'loyal' to the Senate at that moment. But with his remaining force Antony met up with Lepidus and they agreed to ally. Lepidus might or might not have actually wanted to. The Senate then gave Octavian his own 'crossing the Rubicon' moment by demanding Octavian surrender his troops to Brutus, who Antony had been fighting to begin with. Octavian wasn't having it and he met up with Lepidus and Antony. The nuances of the alliance were much more detailed, but essentially, they all wanted power, weren't fond of the Senate, they all were important Romans, and they all had a bone to pick with Caesar's killers. The alliance gave them all relatively what they wanted, because separately the Senate was going to keep trying to quash them and prevent another repeat of Caesar. The murderers of Caesar meanwhile would have flourished. Whatever personal disagreements they had didn't outweigh the benefits of banding together. The battle between Octavian and Antony hadn't been personal to begin with, other than perhaps rivalry as Caesar's would-be heirs. The alliance was born of practicality and not really sentiment, but it wasn't as if they were hated enemies forced to shake hands. The men had clashing personalities and interests, and didn't particularly like each other. But they recognized the value of their positions and Octavian was even willing to marry his sister to Antony. The marriage doesn't seem like a move he would ever make if he found Antony completely vile.\",\n",
       " \"The example that comes to mind is the case of the Roman Emperor Alexander Severus. Alexander Severus did not attempt this on a broad scale, but in certain limited cases. In the Historia Augusta, Alexander Severus is said to have worshipped in a private chapel, or sanctuary, a number of Gods, historical figures, and Demi-Gods, similar in the manner to Marcus Aurelius and Alexander the Great. On top of this, when Alexander Severus had returned to Antioch, his mother, Julia Avita Mamaea, personally summoned the Christian Theologian Origen to tutor the young Emperor in Christian Philosophy, as well as Neoplatonism. His manner of living was as follows: First of all, if it were permissible, that is to say, if he had not lain with his wife, in the early morning hours he would worship in the sanctuary of his Lares, in which he kept statues of the deified emperors — of whom, however, only the best had been selected — and also of certain holy souls, among them Apollonius,116 and, according to a contemporary writer, Christ, Abraham, Orpheus, and others of this same character and, besides, the portraits of his ancestors.117 3 If this act of worship were not possible, he would ride about, or fish, or walk, or hunt, according to the character of the place in which he was. 4 Next, if the hour permitted, he would give earnest attention to p237 public business, for all matters both military and civil, were, as I have said previously,118 worked over by his friends — who were, however, upright and faithful and never open to bribes — and when they had been thus worked over they were given his endorsement, except when it pleased him to make some alteration. -The Life of Severus Alexander, Historia Augusta (29:2-4) Furthermore, according to the Historia Augusta, Alexander Severus had also considered formally building Temples to Christ, which was also apparently considered by Hadrian. Every seven days, when he was in the city, he went up to the Capitolium, and he visited the other temples frequently. 6 He also wished to build a temple to Christ and give him a place among the gods177 — a measure, which, they say, was also considered by Hadrian. For Hadrian ordered a temple without an image to be built in every city, and because these temples, built by him with this intention, so they say, are dedicated to no particular deity, they are called today merely Hadrian's temples.178 7 Alexander, however, was prevented from carrying out this purpose, because those who examined the sacred victims ascertained that if he did, all men would become Christians and the other temples would of necessity be abandoned. The Life of Severus Alexander, Historia Augusta (43:5-7) &#x200B; However, it remains difficult to determine whether these were part of an organized campaign of syncretism, or if they were one individual emperor's idosyncratic religious ideas.\",\n",
       " 'This is one of my favorite things to think about, so I\\'ll give it a shot. Disclaimer that I\\'m firmly in the early Empire/New Testament period, so hopefully some late antiquarians can weigh in on later developments. By the third century there was never, to my knowledge, an attempt to bring the worship of Jesus up to a civic level alongside traditional deities--meaning there weren\\'t major temples or festivals to Christ as part of any civic calendar (although, as I said, late antiquity isn\\'t where I live, and it\\'s possible that if you apply some of the questions I\\'m about to talk about to later events, you could start to see them differently than they\\'re traditionally considered). However, it\\'s possible and perhaps likely that there was a long-ish period where many people were incorporating Jesus into their normal ideas of piety without doing anything that we would consider \"conversion.\" The first thing is that Greco-Roman society did not recognize exclusivity of cult as a value or a necessity. Meaning, you didn\\'t choose which god(s) to worship at the expense of others. Worship of the gods was built into the civic, social, and cultural worldview and was entirely about action--for example, making the correct sacrifices at the correct times--and ethnicity (which is to say, ancestral tradition). Nobody, except some philosophers, was really asking whether you believed in it or believed the correct things about it. They were aware that Judeans required exclusivity, but that was one of the things that made Judeans suspect in the Roman empire, even if their practices were legally tolerated. And that brings us to the second thing, which is that the answer to your question heavily depends on who you\\'re reading. Unfortunately, the bulk of the literature that\\'s been preserved from the ancient world was written by and for the elite. If you spend too much time with Cicero you might think that people were skeptical of the gods all over the place, but Cicero doesn\\'t represent more than half a percent of Roman society. Same with the New Testament--those aren\\'t \"elite\" texts in the sense that they were written by rich and highly educated people, but they are in the sense that they were considered authoritative by Christian leaders from pretty early on. The NT isn\\'t unanimous about hardly anything, but perspectives that were too alternative didn\\'t survive, or only chanced to in things like the Nag Hammadi collection. So in some ways your question is impossible to answer. The Jesus people whose opinions survived are the people who were most invested in exclusivity of cult. It\\'s a minor but growing contention in the field that especially in the first couple of centuries there were a LOT of people who didn\\'t have that investment--after a certain and pretty early point most people in the Jesus tradition were non-Jews, and nothing in their cultural background required that they pick and choose their gods. But the evidence we have for those people is very easy to read through a more orthodox lens. The Pauline literature, and especially 1 Corinthians, gives us peeks at this dynamic, but you have to squint past Paul himself to see it. There\\'s a recent paper in Journal of Early Christian History about the section in 1 Corinthians where he talked about eating meat that was sacrificed at polytheist temples that speculates on this topic. \"Sacrificed Meat in Corinth and Jesus Worship as a Cult among Cults,\" by Margaret Froelich, if you have library access. From the other direction, the non-Christians/non-Jews whose opinions about Jesus survived are almost exclusively in the \"Christianity is a dangerous superstition\" camp. Pliny the Younger is one of the earliest (letter 10.19, which is short and fully google-able, unlike the academic literature), and he never questions that Christians should be punished, just whether he\\'s doing it the right way. \"Depraved, excessive superstition\" is one of the ways he describes Christianity. He tells us of people he arrested who happily denounced Christ and worshipped the emperor and the Roman gods, and what we\\'re supposed to see there is people who either left the group years before or were falsely accused in the first place. But the option that\\'s usually not considered, by Pliny or anyone else, is that there may have been at least a few who didn\\'t deeply feel a contradiction between worshipping Christ and worshipping the emperor, especially when torture and death were at stake. Their leadership was probably, like Paul, warning them about it over and over, but one of the major principles of academic biblical study is that you don\\'t have to warn people about things they\\'re not doing. We also have a lot of evidence of people syncretizing Jesus with other gods. Dennis MacDonald and Courtney Friesen in particular, but also others, have gone on record saying that the Gospel of John takes a whole lot of inspiration from the Dionysus cults. Guess who was miraculously producing wine a long time before it was cool. Here\\'s Pausanias (6.26.1-2, trans. Jones and Ormerod, from the Perseus Project): The place where they hold the festival they name the Thyia is about eight stades from the city. Three pots are brought into the building by the priests and set down empty in the presence of the citizens and of any strangers who may chance to be in the country. The doors of the building are sealed by the priests themselves and by any others who may be so inclined. On the morrow they are allowed to examine the seals, and on going into the building they find the pots filled with wine. Art depicting Jesus with the iconography of Hermes, Helios, or Apollo is also common. Here is a mosaic of Christ that uses the iconography of Sol Invictus. In fact, sometimes the only way to determine that it\\'s Jesus being represented is the fact that the art was found in a church or a Christian tomb or something, but that in itself involves a lot of assumptions. By the time you get to late antiquity Jesus is so popular and embedded that sometimes the direction of syncretization isn\\'t entirely clear--Julian\\'s Aesclepius is probably the result of a whole lot of back and forth between Aesclepius and Jesus over the centuries. These kinds of things are usually labeled \"competition\" in the modern literature, but it\\'s also possible to recognize that Greco-Roman culture had a particular vocabulary for talking about and depicting gods, and it would be natural for people who understand Jesus as a god to bring him into that vocabulary without necessarily intending to displace the traditional gods (Julian is not an example of that, manifestly, but other instances could be). Finally, there are a lot of magical texts, especially in the 3rd century and later, that use Christian and Jewish language, names, etc., side-by-side with traditional Greco-Roman personalities and ideas. The usual way I see this talked about in the secondary literature is \"pagans\" who recognize the power of the Jewish god and Jesus for magical purposes, but if you warp that lens just a tiny bit you get people who have incorporated the worship of Jesus and the Jewish god without exclusivity, just like they incorporated the worship of Isis, Mithras, and the Syrian mother in the centuries before.',\n",
       " \"Well, here's the thing: You're starting from two false premises here. One, clean water was very much a concern and Medieval societies both Christian and Muslim took great pains to ensure their people had a steady supply of clean water; by no means has it ever been 'hard to find'. Second, Muslims did drink, despite the nominal forbiddance against alcohol. Since when has religious law stopped anyone? For the first point, I shall direct you first to the VFAQ (Middle Ages, subsection Health and Hygiene, in case your browser doesn't go there immediately), in particular the answers from u/sunagainstgold and u/Qweniden. To illustrate just how Serious Business water was for the Medieval era, more u/sunagainstgold on the incidents she touches on in her VFAQ post: On the father advising his sons to drink the well-water boiled On the town of Siena that flayed alive someone convicted of well-poisoning And several more illustrative accounts of the Medieval attitude towards water safety The above are all European examples, but they are all strikes against the notion of the water being dirty. And that's for the Christians in a temperate region; water is even more important to the more arid side of the Mediterranean. Indeed, the shaduf (British Pathe showing two pairs of shaduf in action and the noria have been in use in the MENA region far before Islam was a thing, with the Islamic conquests also spreading the noria towards Spain. The qanat (Encyclopedia Iranica for information, Wikipedia for images is the second-most-awesome water technology of the Muslim world (coming second to the noria). u/CptBuck goes further into how desert civilisations do for water For Muslims drinking, see next post.\",\n",
       " 'How did foragers live - a great question. These tricky social-history questions are very difficult to answer using archeology, and I hate to say it but there\\'s no way anyone could write a book that goes over the entirety of such a huge question for all forager peoples of all time periods. There are overviews about specific aspects of life, and there are books about the details of a particular group of people. If you\\'re looking for a general overview of pre-industrial life - for the Americas there\\'s 1491 by Charles Mann. For Papua New Guinea there\\'s The World Until Yesterday by Jared Diamond. And for the world, there\\'s Millennium by David Maybury-Lewis. There\\'s more scholarly overviews focused on hierarchy, The Creation of Inequality by Flannery & Marcus, on economies The Lifeways of Hunter-gatherers by Robert Kelly, and on memory systems Knowledge and Power in Prehistoric Societies by Lynne Kelly. If you\\'re wondering about specific places well there are thousands of books to choose from. About African foragers, the classics are The Forest People by Colin Turnbull (about an Mbuti group in the Ituri rainforest of the DRC) and The !Kung San by Richard Lee (about that Namibian group). There\\'s also the more scholarly African Foragers by Sibel Kusimba. In the Americas, I love Don\\'t Sleep, There are Snakes by Daniel Everett, which is partly about the Piraha people of Brazil and partly his re-conversion from a Christian missionary to proponent of their culture and philosophy. If you\\'re wondering about specific forager cultures in thee past, there\\'s Beyond Death by Bernardo Arriaza, about the early Holocene pereiod Chinchorro forager culture of Argentina and their distinctive mummies (the earliest society to create them). Lastly, while it\\'s an old book I do love Primitive Man as Philosopher, by Paul Radin which is all about looking at indigenous philosophy as philosophy; a new thing at the time . But before you pay for anything, there\\'s a great about of free material on the subject here on the internet! Some lectures about those books I mentioned, Charles Mann talking about 1491 Jared Diamond talking about his book in What can we learn from traditional societies? The Millennium a documentary series by David Maybury-Lewis, which is just as incredible if not better than the book Robert Kelly has a short talk based on his book called Do Hunter-Gatherers Tell Us About Human Nature? and you can listen to a few lectures about the subject if you can turn up the volume loud enough to hear these incredibly quiet lectures Lynne Kelly has a great lecture about the subject of her thesis, A Rational Approach to Oral Tradition and Stonehenge Richard Lee being interviewed about his work with the San Daniel Everett has a few great lectures about his book and Piraha language/philosophy on youtube On this sub I\\'ve written a few posts about daily life and philosophy in indigenous societies in the past that you may find interesting. Did ancient civilizations have history? (yes) Were there civilizations above Mexico? (oh yes) Did Europeans misunderstand indigenous American religions? (of course) Why didn\\'t the neolithic revolution happen earlier? (because they didn\\'t believe it was necessary) What was indigenous American mega-architecture? Trade and expeditions in indigenous North America How were cuts/wounds treated in the Americas and Africa? What was medicine like above Mesoamerica? About Africa, I\\'ve written about how sleep and house architecture is related to one\\'s life, habits, and thought specifically looking at the Aka foragers and Ngandu farmers in central Africa, Have sleep patterns always been the same? About the neolithic period, I\\'ve written a brief answer about hierarchy and a list of sources about Gobekli Tepe, one of the earliest sites of megalithic architecture done by prosperous foragers who were \"at the cusp\" of the neolithic lifestyle. How/when did hierarchy develop? Scholarly resources about Gobekli Tepe? If you enjoyed these here\\'s a list of my other posts There\\'s also the Askhistorians Daily Life in the Past FAQ',\n",
       " 'It\\'s both more complicated and simpler than this. First of all, we have to remember that most school and popular historiography passes over hitler\\'s blunders before 1942. So almost noone will tell you how his generals in 1938 plotted a coup in case he wanted to declare war on Czechoslowakia for the Sudetenland. Noone will tell you how his generals in until 1939 strongly advised him not to invade poland, because they were not ready for a full scale war with France and England, and they wouldn\\'t be ready at least until 1942 just for that front. Hitler was just in the right place at the right time, and with tons of luck, in addition to having some of the best strategical minds under his belt. In 1938 england and france, with the diplomatic help of Italy, ceded the sudetenland: nobody wanted a war and nobody was really ready for one. In 1939, while Most of german forces were invading Poland, French forces, despite being fully mobilized and ready to attack and invade Germany from the unguarded western front, stayed put, and waited. After the 1940 swift victories over Poland, Norway and France (that certainly wasn\\'t hitler\\'s merit) german generals thought it wasn\\'t so bad after all, and got along with hitler\\'s shenanigans. Hitler was never a strategic or tactical mastermind, he mever got full support from the high command and German goals were reached just through sheer luck and Real military genius coming from his generals. Everything in hitler decisions were just blunders, gambles and a sense of omnipotence. It wasn\\'t about \"his achievements\", it was about \"sheer luck and good general achievements\". Anything else is just from nazi propaganda, misconception and popular documentaries. Let\\'s talk about the blunders you point out. 1) Attack on its southern flank and jugoslavia wasn\\'t because he was butthurt. Or, to better say, the attack on Jugoslavia was a necessity as much the whole operation was a necessity to secure its southern flank from the british. In fact the issue in the balkan wasn\\'t Jugoslavia, it was greece, that was at war with Italy since october 1940. Hitler asked to jugoslavia, hungary, romania and Bulgaria military access, that everyone allowed. Jugoslavia too accepted german influence and military access, but then, mere days before the german troops crossing, an internal Jugoslavian coup changed the government and denied access to german troops. So hitler, instead of just passing trough, simply changed the plan to invade the nation and have it under its complete control, while he went down to solve the greek question. So it wasn\\'t a blunder, it was an objective necessity, pushed by any person with a brain. And yeah, yhat costed germany precious weeks in the USSR invasion, but it wouldn\\'t have really changed anything, as long as the soviets know that japan wouldn\\'t attack and could move their veteran troops from the far east to the european theater. 2) invasion of the USSR isn\\'t as much as a blunder as was the invasion of Poland. Everything after september 1st 1939 is mostly just action-reaction. So yeah, the invasion of USSR was inevitable, but his army wasn\\'t really ready, motorised and equipped. Maybe in summer 1942 it could have worked better, but Stalin would have had solved most of his public issues about generals and forces. 3) AG south could have taken ukraine in the right amount of time, but hitler wanted everything and quick. Yeah, taking prisomers and secure its south flank is a true necessity, but taking away forces from the main directive isn\\'t really ideal. And taking moscow would have taken A LOT of efforts, but moscow was worth it. You say that being an infrastructure hub wasn\\'t all that much, but look at a railroad map of russia even today: all roads litterally go into moscow. It was the earth and mind of russia, even if most of industry and resources were behind the Urals. 4)JFC, \"his general failed to deliver\": deliver what? The impossible? As I said before, generals depsised hitler \"strategies\" immediately, even before the war. They were the real mastermind behind ALL german victories, and they never failed because they weren\\'t able, they failed because it wasn\\'t feasible. Because of the lack of manpower, because of the lack of equipment, because of enemies\\' numbers. They strucked victory against every odd, but they couldn\\'t win agains the tides forever. And hitler despised and fired whoever wasn\\'t with him and his omnipotent dreams. Again, popular documentaries won\\'t tell you this, but study Beck, Von Blomberg and Von Fritsch lifes. Qnd then you\\'ll get why hitler loved yesmen. 5) Hitler never needed \"japan navy to invade britain\", the declaration of war was mostly to lure the japanese army into a coordinated effort against the soviet union. Something as \"I declare war on the US amd you declare war on the USSR\". When this didn\\'t happen, well, hitler wasn\\'t so happy about it. And yes, I already told you as most of hitler\\'s \"strategies\" were just huge gambles, it\\'s like having a special, spoiled child playing in a huge mansion with his servitude that must constantly avoid damages to the mansion furnitures and to the child itself, while obeying every order he gives.',\n",
       " \"An Athenian would have loved to know this question was still being asked in 2,500 years — because it shows the remarkable success of Athenian propaganda! The main reason we think of Athens as full of philosophers is because Athenian writing says it was. And the main reason we think Sparta was all brawn and no brain is because Athenian writing says it was. The biggest difficulty with a question like this is chronology: antiquity was not temporally 'flat' (although one scholar, Francis Cairns, infamously and disastrously tried to argue it was); things changed over the years, perhaps less quickly than under capitalism, but with the same certainty. Athens in 450 BCE was not the same as Athens in 300 CE. But when we contrast Athens and Sparta as polarities on the Greek cultural spectrum, we usually have one period in mind: the 5th century BCE and the Peloponnesian War. This is the high summer of the city state, before all of Greece was subsumed into multinational empires in the 4th and 3rd centuries. This is also the setting for Assassin's Creed Odyssey, if you've played it. All our literary sources for what Athens and Sparta were 'like' in the 5th century BCE are Athenian. Thucydides, the great historian of the war, was an Athenian. Aristophanes, a comedic playwright and frequent war-commentator, was Athenian. Xenophon and Plato, who reflect on the war in the following generations, were both Athenians. So too were the myriad of orators whose 'cultural commentary' on Athens and Sparta survives. In fact, almost all surviving literary Greek from the 5th and 4th centuries BCE is Athenian. (By literary, I mean continuous texts, meant for private reading and usually of some length; non-literary texts, like inscriptions, survive from across the Greek world). Athens lost the war and her empire. But before the end of the war, she had been the most powerful naval force in the western Mediterranean. This should tell us that the brains–brawn dichotomy between Athens and Sparta was illusional: Athens had a navy, and a big one, and they were very good at naval warfare, until a cataclysmic and unpredicted loss at the Battle of Aigospotami in 405 BCE, which ended the war. Weakened, the Athenians turned to culture and learning as a source of civic pride. There is no doubt they were good at it: Plato, Aristotle, Antisthenes (the first cynic), Zeno (the first Stoic) all lived and taught in Athens after the war. The second most influential writer of antiquity, Menander the comic playwright, also wrote in this period and was an Athenian. But the Athenians definitely overstated the case: their writings take the realities of Athenian intellectualism to unreal extremes. Take this famous example from the orator Isocrates: 'So far has Athens left the rest of mankind behind in thought and expression that her pupils have become the teachers of the world, and she has made the name of Hellas distinctive no longer of race but of intellect' (Panegyricus 50.) Meanwhile, Xenophon (an Athenian) describes Sparta in the Constitution of the Spartans as an effective, militarised state — but illiterate, hostile to music, lacking in culture and unversed in philosophy. This was a convenient way to explain Athens' loss to a militarily superior foe, while maintaining Athenian superiority in the arts and sciences. The Spartan reality is more complex. There were Spartan poets, like Tyrtaios and Alkman. We now know that Spartan elite was literate, thanks to work by scholars like Paul Cartledge. And recent work by Stephen Hodkinson has overturned our old ideas about Spartan militarism: Hodkinson's archaeological evidence shows that Spartans were foremost farmers, that their famous 'military training machine' was far less pervasive than we once believed, and that the Spartan city state had more similarities with other Greek cities than differences. So much for the 5th century. As the city-state faded in significance, much changed. If Sparta was ever a military machine, then its defeat by Philip II of Macedon in the 330s put an end to that. Athens, meanwhile, did become a centre of learning, something like the ancient world's equivalent of Oxbridge, with the sons of Hellenistic and later Roman elites spending several years there studying with famous philosophers. What about the other city states? Again, we have two problems. First, time is big, and things changed across antiquity. Second, broad qualitative distinctions loom largest in later reception and are often a-historical. We can only speak of the defining characteristics of city-states in relatively narrow terms. Very often, those characteristics are refracted through the eyes of Athenian writers, or later Greeks writing under the Roman empire. The average citizen living in a given city-state probably considered their life completely ordinary, and not marked out by any locally defining characteristics. - Corinth: trade. The Corinthians controlled the isthmus, the narrow strip of land between Attica and the Peloponnese. They had access to the Ionian and Adriatic seas and a flourishing pottery industry. - Megara: the Athenians had a low opinion of the Megarians, who they accused of inventing a particularly lowbrow genre of comedic theatre. - Thebes: Athens' great neighbour. A good chunk of Attic tragedy is set in this city, which the Athenians considered a rival, not least because the Thebans sided with the Persians in the invasion of 480 BCE. - Miletus: on the coast of Asia Minor. The home of the ur-scientist Thales and another scientist Anaximander, some authors describe it as a centre of learning. - Elis: the Olympic games. Elis hosted the Olympics every four years. - Delphi: the oracle. Not strictly a city-state, but a holy sanctuary and attached town. It did not ally itself with different city-states or join any leagues. It was meant to be a place of peace, although the remaining city-states fought 'holy wars' to gain control of the oracle's sanctuary and the routes to it. - Paros: marble. Highly prized, white marble was quarried here. - Magna Graecia: there were countless Greek colonies in southern Italy and Sicily. Many of them became associated with philosophers and poets, especially in the Hellenistic period. The bucolic poet Theokritos was from somewhere in Sicily, though we don't know where. Earlier, Pythagoras, the spiritualist-philosopher and mathematician, lived and taught in a series of Greek colonies in Italy, which became associated with his teachings.\",\n",
       " 'If, by \"universal numerical system\", you mean base 10 place value notation, this system is very widely used because it\\'s very useful. It was possibly invented twice, possibly just once (we don\\'t know whether the early Chinese and Indian systems are independent), and spread. Base 10 systems were widespread before then (but not universal), which reduced the barrier to acceptance of base 10 place value notation. Other systems are in use, including both older and newer systems. Non-place value systems are still used, such as Roman numerals in the West, and special names for numbers such as hundreds, thousands, millions, etc. There are still occasional uses of base 20 (\"Four score and seven years ago\"), base 60 (e.g., dividing degrees and hours into minutes and seconds), and base 12 (dozen, gross) systems. Binary computers have resulted in occasional use of hexadecimal notation. If, by \"universal numerical system\", you mean universal use of the same symbols for the digits: 1, 2, 3, etc., this isn\\'t the case. There are two main families of symbols for digits: those derived from Chinese digits, and those derived from Indian digits (which includes our familiar Western digits 1, 2, 3, etc.). Chinese digits are still used in China and Japan (alongside the Western digits). The symbols used in the various numeral systems derived from the Indian system are diverse, and differ from alphabet to alphabet. While the Western digits are usually called \"Arabic\", Western visitors to Arabic-speaking countries are sometimes surprised to find that they can\\'t read the digits used in Arabic.

       " 'Defining \"social conservatism\" is an issue that requires a broader context. Also, you cannot take a legitimate stand, for or against, something you claim to know nothing about without learning about it in a larger context. Although it became popular to distinguish social conservatism from political conservatism in the late 1900s, I think you may be better served in first working to understand the history of modern conservatism as a whole. You can start by learning about the historical origin of modern conservatism as a response to the French Revolution. Edmund Burke\\'s \"Reflections on The French Revolution\" is important to the legacy of modern conservatism and is a good read. Burkean conservatism has been significant in the history of American conservatism (assuming you are in the U.S.).

       " \"I did some reading on slings when I was at university because one of the sources mentioned them being very deadly and I didnt really believe it. The only things I've heard used are stone, lead and possibly clay, but I didnt see.much about clay. It turns out that the ideal sling projectile is as dense as possible, and easily available or easy to make. For weight/density: lead is best, stones are good, steel also good. For availability: stones are best, lead is ok, steel is bad. They had steel in a lot of historical times and places, but it had far more valuable uses than throwing it at the enemy as it was the best thing for blades. For manufacture: Steel is also much more difficult than lead to form, it needs to either be smithed, or it needs to melted at a temperature that is very difficult to obtain with the methods they had. Lead on the other hand can be melted over a campfire and moulded in a wooden mould or even some sand with holes poked in it. So stones are great because they are easily available and will make a mess of anyone they hit. Lead is great if you can get it because its heavier and hits even harder. Steel is the least effective as it is less dense than most stone as far as I'm aware, in shortest supply, and much more difficult to work. Normally I go along the lines of we dont know but I'm sure someone, somewhere had a go. But I doubt anyone even tried until steel became cheap and available more recent times as it was a potentially wasteful use of a valuable resource and time consuming process to make a less useful product than what they already had.\",\n",
       " 'Great question. First of all, to correct a misconception on this thread, it is not true to say that there\\'s no religious basis for iconoclasm in Islam. In fact, I daresay there are very few religious movements that are as iconoclastic as Islam! There are over a dozen very clear condemnations of picture making in the hadith literature and because of this, there was a near universal agreement among Islamic jurists that there is some level of restriction on drawing pictures. The level of that restriction varied, with some interpreting the narrations to extend only to three dimensional sculptures of animate beings (i.e, a prohibition against creating idols) and others interpreting the narrations to extend to all images. Since your question isn\\'t about this, I won\\'t go into detail, but just thought it merited a mention given the other comment here that\\'s received a lot of upvotes. For more information, some primary sources include: ‘Umdat al-Qari (10:309) of the Hanafi jurist al-Ayni. al-Insaf (1:474) of the Hanbali jurist al-Mardawi. al-Mughni (7:7) of the Hanbali jurist ibn Qudama. al-Sharh al-Saghir (2:501) of the Maliki jurist ad-Dardir. Now, going to photography, it was definitely controversial when it came into Muslim lands. The question was whether photography fell into the prohibition of \"picture making\" or not. The most lengthy discussion on this was written by the then Grand Mufti of Egypt, Muhammad Bakhit, in a work titled al-Jawab al-Shafi fi Ibahat al-Taswir al-Futughraphi in which he came to the conclusion that phography does not fall under the prohibition. It\\'s a lengthy discussion but, simplifying it considerably, his reasoning was that photography is not \"making\" pictures. Rather, the photographer is capturing light and shadows that existed in a moment in time. If it sounds like a semantic difference to you, many of his opponents would agree. Mustafa al-Hamami writes: According to me, this resembles the statement of one who sends a predatory lion to kill the one it kills, or opens an electric current that shocks all those who pass by it, and places poison in food and kills all who take from that food, for when accusation is directed at him he says, ‘I did not kill, only the poison, electricity and lion killed’…” In general, most of the Islamic jurists in South Asia took the position that photography was analogous to picture making and extended the same prohibitions against it. Most of the Islamic jurists in the Middle East, with the exception of Saudi Arabia, took the position that photography was not analogous to picture making and did not extend the same prohibitions against it. Now film, I find really interesting. There is almost universal agreement that live action is not prohibited by these narrations. I say \"almost\" to cover my bases but I personally do not know of any disagreement on this issue. Which isn\\'t to say that there weren\\'t Muslim scholars who criticized cinema and the movie industry. There were, but the criticism was for what was being depicted, not for the medium itself. There is a length article on the subject by Taqi Uthmani, former grand mufti of Pakistan that\\'s been translated into English. You can find it under the title The Legal Status of Pictures and Photography: Commentary on a Hadith from Sahih Muslim. Now, keep in mind, I\\'m specifically answering how it was seen in Islam. That\\'s different than how it was received by Muslims. As the comment above accurately notes, despite these prohibitions, there has always been a long tradition of art and sculpture in the Muslim world.',\n",
       " 'I love questions that I can actually contribute to. My answer will be focused solely on how US agricultural practices & environmental research changed as a direct result of the Dust Bowl. This also spans a bit to the side both geographically & chronologiclally as there were some other things happening concurrently in non-Dust Bowl parts of the US. I would contend that the long-term effects on agricultural practices are the main, national-level lasting effect of the Dust Bowl taken by itself instead of the Bowl as part of the wider Great Depression. So, let\\'s cover what caused the Dust Bowl in the first place. The 1920\\'s saw a drought across much of the US agricultural heartland combined with rock bottom crop prices^5. This actually led to an increase in farmed acres as farmers were trying to expand their operations in order to grow enough to break even. However, the newly plowed farmland was generally not great land for growing things on. Think of fields that would be hard to get a tractor into, stuff that flooded regularly, etc. These new areas were farmed out of desperation & necessity , not because they were productive^4. Plowing techniques at the time were not terribly refined either. Contour plowing was not widely practiced or known by most farmers, let alone things like cover crops or strip till. I do not know exactly what sort of plowing equipment your average 1920s farm would have used, but after plowing I would imagine that the field looked something like a modern chisel-plowed field as chisel plowing still has 0 value for preventing erosion. Notice how exposed the soil is and the size of some of the soil clumps. This will be relevant later. On top of that, some soils are more prone to erosion than others, with sandy soils being the worst offenders^3. This was not really known at the time as a modern understanding of soil as a biome (instead of being chemically identical to crushed rocks) was not really established until Dokuchaev\\'s work in the late 19th century. Crop rotations were not always used either and this caused problems both environmentally and economically. (My favorite thing out of this era is Boll Weevil Monument I want to go see it so badly.) We\\'ve established that the farming practices at the time did not generally allow for soil conservation/erosion prevention. Let\\'s talk about the weather. Dry soil, such as in drought conditions, gets crumbly & breaks apart more easily than when moist. Additionally, plant root systems actually help keep soil in place (this the reason for using cover crops) and this was also impacted by the drought. We\\'ve got a combination of crumbly dry soil, minimal artificial efforts to keep the soil in place, weak root systems, and last but not least: the wind. The Great Plains & Midwest are known for being windy and most of the large scale soil erosion that happens out here is wind-based. Soil gets picked up and blown for miles. I\\'ve seen farmers around here plowing fields with dust clouds following the tractor. That\\'s the setup for the Dust Bowl. By this point, the economy is in the gutter and the Dust Bowl (round 1! It was actually a series of drought waves) was in full swing. FDR gets elected and the New Deal starts up in earnest. There were a whole bunch of programs aimed at farm aid. There were programs to buy surplus, plant trees, provide loans, build windbreaks, educate farmers, you name it. The federal response was huge and Congress got involved directly. Enter the Soil Conservation Service (SCS), stage right! The SCS started out as an agency whose main question was \"How do we stop this erosion?\" and they started digging into researching the problem (heh). As I understand it, a lot of the boots-on-the-ground planting & construction work ended up done through the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), the main(?) New Deal program for improvements to public lands. Skipping ahead a few decades, let me just list off the things still in use that directly derive from the programs and research of the Dust Bowl Era: The US Soil Survey One of the first steps for figuring out how to prevent this level of erosion from happening was to understand the soils themselves. The data on soil properties get used for everything from siting buildings to digging wells, to installing septic systems, to designing drainage plans. The website & data are used daily by engineers, farmers, etc all over the country. Soil conservation efforts became more widespread. This includes things like terraces, swales, crop rotation, cover crops, contour plowing, etc. This also includes research $$ funneled into figuring out how to do these things more efficiently. The research is possible in part because of the Universal Soil Loss Equation^1 (updated version: RUSLE2) which helped quantify various factors such as soil erodibility, water speed, and density of plant cover. The existence of the USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service as the successor to the SCS. The purview of NRCS has widened from strictly soils and now also includes things like managing fertilizer runoff & developing small-scale wildlife habitat. There are also programs through the US Farm Bill which are aimed at farmers who want to address these issues on their own land. The Conservation Reserve Program. CRP provides farmers with conservation advice & financial incentives to actively address erosion issues on their own farm. Enrolling in CRP also gives farmers a way to make money on marginal crop land instead of farming it & causing erosion problems for themselves down the road. I would assume that living memories of the Dust Bowl helped propel the environmental movement of the 1970\\'s but I do not have a source handy to support this claim. The Dust Bowl kickstarted soil science as an established discipline in the US. Soil science as a discipline also concerns itself with the effects of pesticides, nutrient runoff, and has a large intersection with hydrology/engineering. For example, the Gulf of Mexico Dead Zone would be an even larger problem to tackle without the knowledge base that started developing as a result of the Dust Bowl. So yeah, there\\'s a lot that still happens in the agricultural, environmental, scientific, and political spheres that can be traced back to responses to the Dust Bowl. In these areas, it did not so much leave scarring as fundamentally shift the approach to various problems. The Depression in general saw a large reworking of the role of the federal government in general, but that is a larger topic better suited for someone with detailed knowledge of the New Deal. If someone else has more insight into long term social effects, I will defer to them but as for the purely social aspects, the end of the Dust Bowl coincided with World War II. WW2 did a whole heck of a lot to pull us out of the Depression in general and I think the memory of the Dust Bowl\\'s impact got largely absorbed into the cultural memory of the Depression as a whole. The main exception I can think of is John Steinbeck\\'s novel \"The Grapes of Wrath\", which follows a family that was driven off their OK farm by the Dust Bowl. I suspect that this book is the best representation of a purely social-effect cultural memory of the Bowl in particular, as it\\'s widely regarded and still taught in schools. Additionally, I\\'m sure that if you went to areas that were hit directly by the Bowl you would find evidence of communities that disappeared, farms sold/abandoned, and stories accompanying the same.

       " \"So, I don’t know anything about Old Spanish (sorry) or even if it’s called “Old Spanish” officially, but I do study Old English, and the short answer is you can’t read it because it’s basically a different language than Modern English. Old English was spoken/written from about 800-1100 in Britain. It is similar to Old Norse and Old High German and also borrows some grammar from Latin. For a good example of Old English look up the text of Beowulf. Old English is the progenitor of English though, which is why some stuff is familiar. “Wife” for example, was “wīf” in OE (pronounced “weef”) So then the Normans invaded in 1066 and that’s when Old English started to morph into Middle English, which was used from about 1100-1400. BTW, all these dates are rough approximations. Language transitions are long processes that happen at different times in different places. Anyway, now the word “wife” is “wyf” but pronounced the same way as before. During Middle English the Great Vowel Shift happens, so now words are pronounced differently, which leads to them being spelt differently. Middle English has LOTS of variations is spelling (to the point where you can tell where something was written, because the specific regional accent is apparent in the spelling), more so than even Old English, because of the GVS. For a great example of Middle English look at Geoffrey Chaucer‘s Canterbury Tales. A highly literate English speaker can read Middle English without training, but not very well. Anyway, eventually language moves toward standardization and by Shakespeare it is officially “Early Modern English.” This is when English really becomes readable to the average modern English speaker. Still difficult, but it’s no longer a different language entirely. Edit 5- it was pointed out in the comments that Shakespeare is not fully standardized, which is 100% correct, and I forgot to mention it. I’m pretty sure there are even variations between the folios. So when you go to the store and buy a copy of Shakespeare (or read the text I copy/pasted below) I should have noted that the spelling is cleaned up by an editor. It’s still Early Modern English, but it’s not fully standard. Hope that helps! Edit- the Normans were speaking French and that’s why it kick started a major shift in language Final edit! Also don’t think of English as being modern now, so it’s done changing. It’s still changing- it hasn’t stopped. New words appear all the time (yeet, fleek, pwned), or old words are used in new ways. (tablet, text as a verb). Also emojis have also been fully integrated as part of written language 🤷🏼\\u200d♂️ so someday philologists may say that a new phase of English (post modern, maybe?) began around the year 2000 with the dawn of the Internet age. Don’t think of language or history as being “finished” is what I’m saying Edit 2- if you’re curious, here is the first bit of text from Beowulf: Hwæt. We Gardena in geardagum, þeodcyninga, þrym gefrunon, hu ða æþelingas ellen fremedon. Oft Scyld Scefing sceaþena þreatum, monegum mægþum, meodosetla ofteah, egsode eorlas. Syððan ærest wearð feasceaft funden, he þæs frofre gebad, weox under wolcnum, weorðmyndum þah, oðþæt him æghwylc þara ymbsittendra ofer hronrade hyran scolde, gomban gyldan. þæt wæs god cyning. ðæm eafera wæs æfter cenned, geong in geardum, þone god sende folce to frofre; fyrenðearfe ongeat þe hie ær drugon aldorlease lange hwile. Him þæs liffrea, wuldres wealdend, woroldare forgeaf; Beowulf wæs breme blæd wide sprang, Scyldes eafera Scedelandum in. Edit 3- and this is my favorite bit from the General Prologue of Canterbury Tales: A CLERK ther was of Oxenford also, That unto logik hadde longe y-go. As lene was his hors as is a rake, And he nas nat right fat, I undertake; But loked holwe, and ther-to soberly. Ful thredbar was his overest courtepy; For he had geten him yet no benefyce, Ne was so worldly for to have offyce. For him was lever have at his beddes heed Twenty bokes, clad in blak or reed, Of Aristotle and his philosophye, Than robes riche, or fithele, or gay sautrye. But al be that he was a philosophre, Yet hadde he but litel gold in cofre; But al that he mighte of his freendes hente, On bokes and on lerninge he it spente, And bisily gan for the soules preye Of hem that yaf him wher-with to scoleye. Of studie took he most cure and most hede. Noght o word spak he more than was nede, And that was seyd in forme and reverence, And short and quik, and ful of hy sentence. Souninge in moral vertu was his speche, And gladly wolde he lerne, and gladly teche. Edit 4- and just for good measure here’s some Shakespeare: Chorus. Two households, both alike in dignity, In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life; Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Do with their death bury their parents' strife. The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love, And the continuance of their parents' rage, Which, but their children's end, nought could remove, Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage; The which if you with patient ears attend, What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.\",\n",
       " \"/u/RickFletching Pretty much said it all, but I do want to point out that this Spanish poem is a little more contemporary with Early Middle English than Old English. It might be better to compare something with The Owl and The Nightingale an Early Middle English poem. Note that El Cantar Del Mio Cid is (from what I can tell) from Old Castillian specifically, while this poem might come from a dialect that didn't evolve into Modern English. Anyway, you can see that this is still quite hard to read, though it's easier to tease out a meaning than Beowulf. It's also not nearly as easy as Chaucer, which is difficult, but more what I think of when you describe reading El Cantar Del Mio Cid.\",\n",
       " 'This is a really interesting question! To start with I would challenge the assertion that meat was seen as \"uncivilized\" in ancient Egypt, although bread was understandably important. The average ancient Egyptian had a diet which was based on bread, beer and porridge made of barley or wheat. Legumes and vegetables prevented enough protein and amino acids to largely replace meat for the common people. Their meals were brightened up by fruits, vegetables and herbs which could be easily grown and prepared. All of these items were able to produced by peasants for themselves, and were either easily preserved or were eaten in season. It is hard to overestimate the importance of bread in ancient Egypt. The development of agriculture along the Nile River and the production of beer and bread by prehistoric societies is what allowed permanent settlements, and eventual civilization in Egypy. Bread was ritually and spiritually important because it was in many ways the basis of Egyptian civilization. But, bread was not important because it was contrasted with meat as civilized vs uncivilized food. It was because bread was so basic and essential that they could not imagine life without it. In ancient Egypt, as in later periods, meat was a luxury enjoyed on special occasions and by the wealthy. In Egypt\\'s hot climate, any meat not immediately eaten had to be preserved. Unfortunately, little is known about methods of meat preservation in Egypt. Drying was a primary method, although curing, brining and smoking methods were also known. #Patterns of meat consumption Since animals were expensive to raise and meat could not be easily preserved for long periods, it made more sense to keep livestock alive for dairy and eggs than to kill them. An exception was made during special occasions, when animals were slaughtered for feasts and sacrifices. Most scenes of slaughter in Egyptian art depict a sacred or ritual slaughter as part of an offering. Special prayers or consecrations may have been spoken during these moments when the butcher (possibly a priest or doctor) slaughtered the animal. Egypt developed sophisticated methods of butchery and meat preparation for both large and small mammals. Of course, methods of butchery changed with the introduction of Islam and the adoption of halal dietary laws during the Middle Ages, which mandates specific methods of slaughter intended to minimize suffering. The majority of the meat from offerings would have been eaten by people, with only a small portion being sacrificed to gods or the spirits of the deceased. This pattern of infrequent meat consumption except on occasions of ritual sacrifice was common throughout the ancient Mediterranean. The fact that meat would have most often been consumed during occasions of religious importance means that meat was associated with sacredness, not just luxury. According to ancient Egyptian beliefs, the dead still required offerings of food to subsist on. The ritual menus left behind include items like meat, fowl, fish, bread, beer, fruit and wine. Even more excitingly, the remains of some of these offerings have been found in tombs. Cups with residue, and dishes with long petrified morsels. The fact that meat was included among the types of nourishment offered to the dead implies that it was acceptable both spiritually and culturally. The wealthy aristocracy had the opportunity to consume meat more frequently, although bread and vegetables were still the basis of the diet. Bulls, specially fattened with dough and grain, were the most highly regarded source of meat but were eaten only by the most wealthy. The reason for this is again related to the difficulty in preserving meat in ancient Egypt. Households had to be large enough to consume the meat from a bull in order to justify slaughtering one, and peasant households were much smaller. Smaller households consumed goats and sheep instead. In addition to staples, great feasts often featured more elaborate or exotic meat dishes, including some that seem strange today, like clay roasted hedgehog. These were prepared by skilled chefs for nobles and royalty. They were served alongside delicacies like wine and imported foods (foreign cheeses, fruits, etc). #Sources of meat in Ancient Egypt Cattle, sheep, donkeys and goats were often raised for dairy, with cattle and donkeys also serving as beasts of burden. Cattle were extremely important livestock in Egypt, and the most prized source of red meat. Domestic chickens were probably not introduced until the Hellenistic period (323-30 BCE), although other fowl such as geese and ducks were known. By the time the historical record begins, livestock was the primary source of meat, while hunting had become more of a sport than a method of subsistence. This is not to say that game was not consumed, just that wild meat typically ended up on the tables of the wealthy during special occasions or after hunting trips. Hunting and fowling are commonly depicted in tomb art. Wealthy Egyptians frequently decorated their tombs with images of them with loved ones or engaging in recreation. These paintings show us how the wealthy spent their time, and how they wanted to imagine their afterlife. Despite the fact that most Egyptians lived near sources of water, fish was not as central to the diet as in some other ancient diets. However, Egyptians did harvest various types of fish, eels and other animals which lived in Egypt\\'s lakes and rivers. This was a cheaper and more readily available source of meat than game or livestock. The ancient Egyptians cooked meat in a variety of ways. In modern Egypt and Sudan, boiling and frying meat are the most popular methods. This is likely true of ancient Egypt as well, although spit-roasting birds or fish is frequently depicted. Ancient Egyptians distinguished animal fat from vegetable fat in cooking, and made use of vegetable oils, clarified and unclarified butter, and animal fats (like goose fat) in their diet. #Pork taboo That\\'s not to say that meat consumption wasn\\'t sometimes scrutinized. There is considerable controversy over whether pork was forbidden in ancient Egypt, as some Greek authors (namely Herodotus) claimed. Pigs were considered to be somewhat taboo in ancient Egypt but it is clear that domestic pigs were raised. Pigs and pork preparation are rarely if ever depicted in Egyptian art, and were associated with the god Seth, a chaotic figure in Egyptian mythology. Pork consumption was also at times associated with foreigners (Seth was the god of foreigners, strife and the desert) which did have uncivilized connotations. It has been suggested that pork was forbidden to priests or at certain times of year. Pork was rarely offered to the dead, and was not used in offerings to gods, indicating that it was considered unsuitable for this. The fact that it was a cheap source of meat may have meant that the very poor could not afford to heed the taboo. Archaeological evidence shows that in many parts of Egypt pork was widely consumed by the poor. At times pharaohs even donated large numbers of pigs to temples. This makes sense given that pigs are easy to raise and can subsist on scraps rather than grain or pasture. They also grow rapidly and produce more meat (which is more nutritious gram for gram) than sheep or goats. In Choice Cuts: Meat Production in Ancient Egypt, Salima Ikram suggests that the taboo against pork may have been rooted in health considerations. Undercooked pork carries parasites like trichinosis and pork spoils more rapidly than most other meats. Whatever the case, it is clear that pork was not highly regarded in ancient Egypt although it was consumed from time to time, especially by those who could afford alternatives. You might like this older answer I wrote about food in ancient Egypt that talks about how the ancient Egyptian diet changed over time.',\n",
       " \"Whaling fleets often had go to anchorages or other spots near the grounds they would stop at. In addition to the common ports on the way to their chosen grounds, they would need a few spots that could be used for things like getting fresh water, making repairs at anchor, or over wintering. This was particularly common in the Arctic and Antarctic Grounds. These places would not have much if any short facilities, just a harbor that a company's ships or ships from the same owner or home port or nation might gather. Doubly true if there were seal populations to be harvested too. Places like South Georgia and Deception Island in the South. And in the Bering Sea you have places like St. Lawrence Island and the Diomedes. And these were not exactly state secrets, for instance during the American Civil War the Confederate raider CSS Shenandoah took and burned nearly half the Yankee whaling fleet in the Bering Sea over the course of 2 weeks mostly around those islands or along the Russian coast. But also not all whaling was done on a 3 year blow that takes you to the other side of the world. In many places it is a local occupation, and traces its roots to early settlement of areas and native peoples, and was conducted from the beach in small boats. One of the places this is true for is New Zealand, places like Otago Harbor on the South Island and the Bay of Islands on the North in the first half of the 19th century were major bases for whaling. And it is from New Zealand that the song comes from! In the 1830's and 40's Whaling was THE driver of the economy for the European settlers of the islands, and fleets from as far away as Europe and New England also came on the promise of easy whaling. These bases would be more developed, with processing and storage facilities, and when it is a shore based fleet of course residences for the occupants. As for their prey it was as noted mostly Right Whales. Shore-based whalers hunted the black or right whale, which followed established migration routes around the New Zealand coast. In early winter females travelled up the east coast of the South Island. Some passed through Cook Strait, while others went on up the east coast. Along the way they sheltered in harbors such as Otago, Akaroa or Cloudy Bay to calve. Because right whales are big, relatively peaceful, do not usually sink once killed, and produce good quality oil, they were easy targets. To give you an idea of just how popular these ports were. In 1838 the Bay of Islands hosted 54 American ships along with 14 British, 18 French and 10 from Sydney. The Weller brothers owned a trading concern, who were instrumental in establishing the station at Otago Harbor, and now the city of Dunedin in the 1830's to the early 1840's. And one key aspect of that was bringing supplies in from the larger ports like Christchurch or from Australia, with their employees being known as Weller-men. So their vessels would mean fresh supplies or luxuries for the men doing the whaling! The local Maori population that remained was also part of these boom town, selling agricultural products to both whalers and traders it is worth noting too. If you are interested more in the history of whaling in New Zealand this is a very readable good place to start, and where I pulled the two quotes from! https://teara.govt.nz/en/whaling\",\n",
       " \"I can answer some, but not all, of your questions. That's because some are specific to domestic US politics (which is not my area of expertise) while others are about Cold War international relations (which I have done some reading on). Before answering your question on Nixon's motives, I feel it's important to give you a few qualifications, as this will answer several of your other questions. It's important to qualify that Nixon did NOT endorse the One China policy. The wording of the 1972 Joint Communique between the USA and PRC (the Shanghai Communique ) is very careful and very precise. Both sides laid out 'their side' of each issue separately, rather than presenting a shared view of the status of China and Taiwan. The US delegation stated that the US accepted that both those on the mainland and those on Taiwan considered there to be only one China. It did not state that the USA believed there to be only China, not did it express which government it regarded as the legitimate representative of one China. Nixon left the USA's position ambiguous in the hope that this would provide leverage for future negotiations. It was Carter who formally switched US recognition from the Republic of China (Taiwan) to the People's Republic of China (mainland China) seven years later. Second, Taiwan was not a democracy in 1972. It was a military dictatorship, governed by Chiang Kai-shek, an army general who seized power in 1927 and only held a single national election in 1947, which was boycotted by virtually all opposition groups by virtue of the fact that it was held during the middle of the Chinese Civil War. Thus, in terms of US ideals, the only difference between the governments of the two Chinas was that one was a non communist dictatorship friendly to the US and the other was a communist dictatorship that was hostile to it. This was obviously an important distinction during the Cold War, but Nixon (unlike earlier Cold War presidents) recognised that communism was not a monolithic force directed from Moscow, but a broad and hotly debated philosophical tradition with many national variations, and that individual communist states has different national interests. Hence, Nixon and his National Security Advisor, Henry Kissinger, adhered to the doctrine of realpolitik: considering the pragmatic needs of your diplomatic partners and rivals and how they serve your pragmatic needs rather than their ideological alignments and your own ideals. Which brings us to the answer to your main question: Nixon traveled to China and agreed to the Shanghai Communique because it served his foreign policy objectives. Nixon's overriding objective was to extricate the USA from the Vietnam War without seeming to abandon South Vietnam or to surrender. Thus, he sought to gain the support of China and the USSR in pressuring North Vietnam into negotiating peace. Kissinger called this 'linkage': connecting your offer of concessions (e.g. opening talks to recognise China at the expense of the relationship with Taiwan) with a concession by an opponent elsewhere in the world (e.g. China pressuring its ally North Vietnam to abandon its plans of national unification and to accept the separation of Vietnam). Nixon also recognised the Sino-Soviet Split as an opportunity for the USA. The Shanghai Communique would exacerbate the split in the foreign policies of the PRC and USSR. It would highlight that the capitalist USA and Communist China were capable of peaceful relations, and thereby expose how the USSR did not necessarily control or lead the communist world. Indeed, given Chinese security concerns regarding the USSR, Nixon and Kissinger hoped they might be opening the door to a new prospective ally against the USSR. And at the end of the day, the USA's alliance with Taiwan was ultimately a product of the desire of Truman and Eisenhower to contain Soviet communist geopolitical influence, so in this regard, moves towards recognising China were a continuation of the Truman Doctrine of containment. Main source: John Lewis Gaddis, The Cold War: A New History I've also drawn on arguments by Jonathan Fenby, Modern China: The Fall and Rise of a Great Power Finally, it's really worth reading the text of the Shanghai Communique itself to see the nuances of the Nixon Administration's position: http://www.taiwandocuments.org/communique01.htm\",\n",
       " 'CW: sex, penetration, homophobia, paedophilia, paederasty, rape He means men who have sex that was considered \"unnatural\" — probably homosexual sex and sex with boys. The translation you are using is not literal: the original Latin reads corpore infames, which means something like \\'those who have a bad reputation with respect to their bodies\\'. Tacitus elsewhere uses the phrase to refer to a mime-actor (Ann. 1.73.2) and to an effeminate senator (Ann. 15.49.4). In those two cases, it is a euphemism for a man who takes the passive role in homosexual sex (Much 1967, Rive 1999). It\\'s difficult to tell what the euphemism means here. That\\'s because, while we know a lot about Roman sexual mores, we know little about Germanic practices. At Rome, homosexual sex per se was not shameful: but it was considered disreputable to be the passive or \\'receiving\\' partner in male anal sex. The Romans used the originally Greek word pathicus to refer to a man who allowed himself to be penetrated by other men. There was another Greek word, cinaedus, which referred to effeminate, sexually \"deviant\" men generally. Men who took the penetrating role in sex kept their reputations, as a rule. The partial exception was if they penetrated younger boys: this practice, known as paederasty (\\'love of children\\') was common in parts of Greece. It was tolerated but frowned upon at Rome. Whether Roman sexual morality can be mapped onto German sexual morality is highly doubtful. So Tacitus may be referring to a wider prohibition on homosexual sex than existed in his own culture. There is evidence that at least some Germanic tribes criminalised all forms of homosexuality. As both Much 1967 and Rive 1999 explain, most Germanic languages had a word denoting \"disgraceful\" effeminacy: Old Norse argr or ragr, Langobardic arga. Some surviving legal codes from the early mediaeval period penalised argr, which could be committed by having sex with a man, or insulting another man\\'s masculinity, or through cowardice. Some scholars have speculated that in this passage Tacitus is translating the word argr (or is explaining the concepts involved — it is unlikely he knew any Germanic language). He uses three terms to describe the \"criminals\" who are drowned in the swamp: corpore infames (as above); ignavos (lazy, cowardly); imbelles (unwarlike). Rather than imagining each term refers to a separate crime, it may be that each denotes a constituent part of argr. For a German, all three terms may have been part of the same concept, as Much notes. From Tacitus\\' period, there is some evidence the Germans abhorred paederasty. Tacitus himself reports (Hist. 14.4.1) that the Batavian revolt in 69 CE began as an angry reaction to Roman officers abducting local boys to use for sex. But as Rive 1999 notes, an angry reaction to the abduction and rape of one\\'s children is not surprising, and is not evidence of the Batavians\\' own sexual practices. On the other hand, there are some Greek philosophers who suggest homosexuality was widespread among German peoples (e.g. Sext. Emp. Pyr. 3.99). But Rive 1999 puts little stock in these testimonia, because Greek ethnography regularly confused the Germans with the Gauls: the philosophers who speak of German homosexuality may in fact be thinking of Gallic practices. So while we can be certain \\'those who disgrace their bodies\\' were men who practised \"unnatural\" sex, we cannot know for sure what that sex was. It may have been all forms of homosexuality; it may have been, as at Rome, only \\'passive\\' homosexuality\\'; or it may have been a constituent part of a wider concept of \\'unmanliness\\' found in German customary law.

       " \"Different factions responded very differently. Some were very concerned, others had bigger problems to deal with, a few were (initially) pretty happy about it. The first Muslim ruler the crusaders faced was Kilij Arslan, a Turkish sultan who ruled most of Anatolia. He was at war in eastern Anatolia at the time, and initially dismissed the crusaders as a threat. Before the proper crusade showed up, a highly disorganised force known as the 'People's Crusade' had attempted to enter Anatolia and been crushed by one of Arslan's generals. The People's Crusade was more of a rabble than a military force. It had no agreed upon commanders and leadership shifted as different individuals gained and lost the confidence of the crowd. There were ethnic tensions within it, with French and German crusaders attempting to outdo one another, and it had no plan. They were defeated by a small force gathered from local garrisons. So when the First Crusade proper showed up, he didn't do anything. He thought, based on this prior experience, that they'd be defeated by the garrison of the first town they came across. This abruptly changed when the First Crusade attempted to conquer Nicea and won. He turned his army around and headed west to meet this force in person, which he did at the Battle of Dorylaeum on 1 July 1097. The Turks fought like hell (which the crusaders admired them for) but ultimately lost the battle. In military terms, the defeat probably wasn't that bad, but with so much on his plate Arslan made the decision to just leave the crusaders alone, preserve his forces, and live to fight another day. After making their way across Anatolia the crusaders arrived at the city of Antioch by the eastern Mediterranean coast. The governor of Antioch, Yaghi-Siyan, was aware that the crusaders' path was taking them to his city, so he sent out letters to various local noblemen asking for help. By this point, every ruler in the Middle East must have found out, if they didn't already know from the whispers of traders or diplomatic communications with the Byzantine Empire or Kilij Arslan. However, the Seljuk Empire, which had conquered everything from Georgia in the north to Jersusalem in the south, was fragmenting. This resulted in regional wars and conflicts of interest between the various Muslim rulers of the region. Everyone in the Seljuk Empire was too busy with regional conflicts and jostling for power to form a unified response in time, and the Siege of Antioch dragged on for months before a relief army arrived. The first army that attempted to relieve Antioch retreated after running into a force of knights, as the commander was not invested in the outcome and left once the excuse was there. A second, much larger relief force was assembled but arrived too late to prevent the city's fall and, when it did fight the crusaders, it suffered the same command issues as this was an even larger coalition of leaders. The second time was even worse, as the leader of the army (Kerboga, Atabeg of Mosul) was actively undermined by his new 'allies', who plotted to retreat early and leave Kerboga's forces alone on the battlefield. Particularly noteworthy was Duqaq, leader of Damascus, who was the first to flee and who capitalised on the defeat of the Muslim army by taking control of Homs as the other leaders were licking their wounds. The failure to relieve Antioch tells us that, while some were concerned about this western army, others were indifferent or saw opportunity in the chaos it could create. So the leaders of the Seljuk Empire were too divided to form a good response. Another major Muslim faction, the Fatimid Caliphate, was actually quite happy about the arrival of the crusaders. The Fatimids and Seljuks had been at war for years and were stuck in an awkward stalemate. To the Fatimids, the crusaders were the key to breaking that stalemate. While the crusaders were at Antioch, Fatimid envoys arrived to propose an alliance, initially believing them to be mercenaries for the Byzantine Empire. Their offer was actually pretty sweet: the crusaders could take anything they wanted from the Turks and keep it, and the Fatimids would coordinate attacks into Seljuk lands. Their price was Jerusalem. The Fatimids had taken advantage of the Siege of Antioch to march north and claim the holy city, and they expected to keep it. The crusaders, who had marched thousands of miles, lost thousands of people, and endured unimaginable hardship all to reach and conquer the city, refused. Obviously, the Fatimids then knew the crusaders' intentions and prepared to defend Jerusalem, though their reinforcing army arrived too late to protect the city and was defeated at the Battle of Ascalon. So the Muslim rulers of the Middle East had advanced warning that an army of Europeans was coming their way, and many knew its purpose of reaching Jerusalem, but they formed no unified response because... why would they? The elite of the Seljuk Empire were not popular, and the enemy of an enemy could be a friend. Many Muslim rulers saw the First Crusade not as a threat, but as an opportunity, so all attempts to create a unified response were undermined by those who thought they could profit from a new faction in the region, or could not overcome their personal rivalries to actually work together.\",\n",
       " \"Adding to what u/J-Force has already said, there are very few, if any, contemporary sources about the first crusade from the Muslim side. It seems that most of them didn't realise the true scope or the intention of the Christian host and instead thought of them as mercenaries employed by the byzantines. Yaghi Siyan did appeal to the emirs of Aleppo and Damascus (both of whom approached at separate time due to their rivalries and were beaten back) and to the Caliph in Baghdad, who dispatched Kerbogha. Afterwards, when the crusaders advanced to Jersualem, the fatimids were definitely aware of it and prepared for it by poisoning local wells and expelling the Christian population from the city. Al-Afdal, the vizier of the Shia Caliphate was also preparing a relief force, which arrived a little late but was defeated at the battle of Ascalon. After the crusade a muslim jurist from Damascus, Ali ibn Tahir al-Sulami, seems to have correctly identified that the Franks were waging a holy war targeting Jerusalem but his calls for action against them weren't heeded. (Source: Asbridge, The Crusades) Regarding your follow-up question regarding the intentions of the first crusaders, many of them also harboured personal ambitions. Bohemond for example refused to follow the crusade to Jerusalem and held onto Antioch as his prize. Edit: Regarding some books for Islamic perspectives I would suggest Crusades through the Arab Eyes and Thomas Asbridge- The Crusades. Asbridge shifts to muslim and Christian perspectives with almost each chapter and is unbiased. He also mentions multiple contemporary islamic sources.\",\n",

For your purposes, we can start you off with Osprey books, as the colour plates and the focused nature make them easier to digest. Osprey can be hit-or-miss, so be cautious about the author; in this case, I recommend David Nicolle, specifically his European Medieval Tactics, Part 1 and Part 2 I'd especially recommend Part 2, as Osprey offers it in digital format as well, so less hassle. They'll give you a decent rundown of what warfare looked like in Europe from the period 450-1260 (Part 1) and 1260-1500 (Part 2), and thus you can establish your general Medieval picture from there.\",\n",
       " 'Dont know about military stuff in deep, but I would recommend some sources that address the topic directly or indirectly. All of what i mention here are well known books from different epochs. Classics like Thucydides History of the Peloponnesian War and Herodotus The Histories (i had a blast reading this one in college). Julius Cesar also wrote some about hes deeds, The Gallic Wars. Also, the great arab classic One Thousand and One Nights (not much specific of military on this one but worth reading some of the short tales). You could check about the Inca the chronics of Garcilaso de la Vega Comentarios Reales de los Incas. And the conqueror of what we know as Mexico today Hernán Cortéz letters to the emperor Carlos V Cartas de relación (i also had alot of fun reading this one). All of this are probably easy to find on internet free. Now, if you want the historian or expert insight try to find ones that have a critical introduction. Good luck whit your fantasy writing!',\n",
       " 'First \"Mahayana\" can be very broad. It is usual to divide Buddhism into two broad categories: Mahayana and Theravada. Thus, Vajrayana, Zen/Chan, and Jodo Shinshu are all part of Mahayana, Zen and Jodo Shinshu being schools, and Vajrayana a broad category covering tantric Buddhism. Chinese Mahayana Buddhism, and its offshoots in Korea, Japan, and Vietnam, originated in Central Asia. Buddhism travelled north from India, and into Sogdia (upper Transoxiana, centred around cities such as Samarkand and Bukhara). From there, to China. Central Asian Buddhism was largely displaced by the spread of Islam, leaving traces, including very spectacular ones such as the Buddhas of Bamiyan, which stood for one and half millennia until their destruction by the Taliban in 2001. The Buddhism that emerged into China had been changed by its passage, and the distinctiveness of East Asian Mahayana is due to this evolution as Buddhism passed through Central Asia, as well as further evolution in China. Buddhism in Japan has a long history, the early part of which isn\\'t well known. The Nihon Shoki (AKA Nihongi) places the arrival of Buddhism (from Korea) in the mid-6th century. Not all of the early Japanese schools are considered Mahayana by all, with 2 of the main early 6 schools (all ultimately of Chinese origin) being labelled as \"Hinayana\" (\"inferior vehicle\", in contrast to \"Mahayana\", \"great vehicle\", with derogatory intent). Buddhism grew in Japan in the Heian Period, and new schools were introduced and developed, notably Tendai (Tiantai in China, literally \"Heavenly Tower\", but AKA the \"Lotus School\"). When Chan (AKA Zen) reached Japan at the end of the 12th century, it absorbed much from Tendai (both from Japanese Tendai and from Chinese Tiantai). The 13th century saw the arrival or development of the biggest schools of the future: Nichiren Buddhism developed from Tendai, and Pure Land Buddhism. Simplifying (oversimplifying, even), we can contrast Zen and Pure Land Buddhism by Zen\\'s focus on self-improvement and personal enlightenment, and Pure Land\\'s belief in the inherent corruption of the world and salvation through faith, with rebirth in the Pure Land (i.e., Heaven). The Pure Land practice of seeking mindfulness of the Buddha through repetition of the name of Amitabha (AKA Amida Buddha) in prayer led to the alternative English name of Amidism. Self-improvement vs acceptance of a corrupt world with hope for a rebirth in the Pure Land as a result of faith may well have influenced the spread of these very different types of Buddhism among the upper classes and the peasantry, respectively. Jodo Shinshu is a Pure Land school. When it began, it was criticised by other sects (including other Pure Land sects). First, they believed that the world was becoming increasingly degenerate and corrupt, and older paths to enlightenment and salvation were no longer effective. This was an at least implicit criticism of other schools. Its prioritisation of faith over ritual was also a criticism of other schools. Jodo Shinshu, and in particular Hongan-ji, grew spectacularly in the 15th century, which attracted attention from the great secular power players, such as Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu, and other sects. Mt Hiei took military action against Honganj-ji, and Oda Nobunaga also did so. A Hongan-ji faction which supported Togugawa Ieyasu was rewarded by Ieyasu by recognition as an independent sect, with its own lands. This division is often described as an action by Ieyasu to limit the power of Hongan-ji by breaking it into distinct sects, and reducing the power of the non-supportive factions of Hongan-ji may well have been one of his motives. The religious basis of the Ikko-Ikki was Hongan-ji, but (a) the leadership of Hongan-ji kept themselves distanced from the Ikko-Ikki, prominently repeating their rejection of violence, and (b) the Ikko-Ikki didn\\'t obey the leadership of Hongan-ji. The Ikko-Ikki did have communist elements in their religious and political belief (as did comparable European politico-religious movements such as the Hussites and the Levellers). The 16th century growth of Jodo Shinshu, especially of Hongan-ji, and the popular appeal of the sect, led to it being the biggest sect in modern Japan. This isn\\'t due to some miraculous recovery after systematic suppression. Jodo Shinshu was suppressed in southern Kyushu in the mid-late 16th century, remaining banned there until the Meiji Restoration. This led to the underground Kakure Nenbutsu groups preserving Jodo Shinshu teachings there. However, this was only a localised suppression, and as noted above, some factions received official support from the Tokugawa government, thanks to well-timed support given to the Tokugawa in their climb to power. Postscript: Shingon Buddhism is the biggest surviving Japanese tantric Buddhist school, and is part of Vajrayana. This comes from old Chinese roots, and owes little if anything to Tiberan Vajrayana. Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhism had its biggest pre-modern spread outside Tibet when the Mongol Empire adopted Tibetan Buddhism.

       " 'Here are a few more recommendations for you. Books Why You Can’t Teach United States History Without American Indians ed. by Susan Sleeper-Smith. Each chapter of this book is written by an expert on a different part of American history. Covering topics from the fur trade to the New Deal, they reframe common topics in US history courses by looking at how questions of Indigenous sovereignty and identity were crucial to how those events unfolded. Each chapter blew my mind. Native North American Art by Janet C. Berlo and Ruth B. Phillips. Great overview of the artistic traditions of North America, from prehistoric times to the present. It\\'s split into regions which makes it easy to digest, and there are lots of beautiful photographs of artwork. Chaco Canyon by Brian Fagan. Book by an archaeologist that brings to life a particular site, Chaco Canyon in the southwest. In the equivalent of Europe\\'s High Middle Ages, Chaco Canyon was a major pilgrimage destination site with the largest building north of Mexico. Fagan takes you through the different phases in the life of the site, focusing on how people lived their everyday lives. Walking in the Sacred Manner by Mark St. Pierre and Tilda Long Soldier. Beautiful book full of first-person interviews about holy women among the Plains Indians. You\\'ll learn a lot about the roles that women have long played in Plains societies and their religions. Sisters in Spirit: Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Influence on Early American Feminists by Sally Roesch Wagner. This book looks at how white American feminists like Matilda Gage were directly inspired by women\\'s rights among the Haudenosaunee in launching their own battle for suffrage. As I\\'ve said before... it puts the \"Seneca\" back in Seneca Falls! You can also hear the author speaking about this topic in this video Gods of the Andes by Sabine Hyland. This book is a translation of a text produced in the early colonial period in Peru. It was written by a mestizo Jesuit named Blas Valera. Valera would eventually be excommunicated by the other Jesuits for his heretical belief that the Incas worshipped the same Creator God as Christians. Gods of the Andes is his record of Inca religion. Braiding Sweetgrass by Robin Wall Kimmerer. If you\\'re interested in environmental and agricultural history, this collection of essays is a great choice. Kimmerer is a Citizen Potawotami scientist who is also a Western-trained biologist. She writes really beautifully and accessibly about how she weaves those two perspectives together in her interactions with the world. She includes a lot of information about historical agriculture and environmental management practices among some different Native nations. Online As for websites, check out Native-Languages.org to read about any specific tribe\\'s history and culture. Native Appropriations is a good blog run by Adrienne Keene where she examines the troubled history behind many pop culture representations of Native peoples. Keene also co-hosts the podcast All My Relations with Matika Wilbur, where they explore topics of interest to contemporary Indigenous people which often address historical issues. Two other good podcasts are Red Man Laughing by Ryan McMahon and This Land by Rebecca Nagle. Nagle\\'s podcast is more specifically historical in its focus, dealing with the historical background behind the 2020 Supreme Court case McGirt v. Oklahoma, where the court ruled that over one third of Oklahoma legally belongs to the Muscogee Creek and other tribes. There are some good resource lists online concerning Native American history and culture topics. The Native American Rights Fund has a good one. There\\'s also the Two Spirit and LGBTQIA Indigenous Resources guide hosted by the University of Toronto. The National Film Board of Canada hosts a short documentary called \"First Stories - Two Spirited\" on their website as well. Crown Canyon Archaeological Centre hosts two different Pueblo Indian History sections on their website. There\\'s one for adults but honestly I think the one for children is better. This is really good for getting a handle on history in the US Southwest, including a lot of pre-Columbian materials. Another website ostensibly aimed at children but with loads of excellent information is Aztecs at Mexicolore The Milwaukee Public Museum hosts a great Wisconsin Indian Resource Project with a lot of historical info. The Florida Museum has a similar webpage called the Calusa Domain which goes through the history of the pre-Columbian and early colonial Calusa people. Some great reconstructions of Mayan historical sites are hosted on Maya 3D Certain artists online also specialize in historical reconstruction art which usually includes some good historical info in the description. I recommend Daniel Parada for pre-Columbian Mesoamerican art and Christine Clados for South American and Caribbean art. Clados also has a great short book called Reconstructing the Pre-Columbian World. I myself sometimes draw historical reconstruction art of pre-Columbian people in the Americas which you can see on my Women of 1000 website. Lots of different Native American museums host informative videos online even if you can\\'t visit them in person. Skä•noñh, the Great Law of Peace Center, is run by the Onondaga and has uploaded several videos on YouTube Another Haudenosaunee museum, Ganondagan, which is run by the Seneca, has a YouTube channel with informative videos. The Smithsonian Museum of the American Indian has a great website called Native Knowledge 360˚ with informative articles in both English and Spanish.',\n",
       " 'I can recommend a few very good books about indigenous history and culture in north America. If you are looking for a standard comprehensive historical primer, though, I do not have a recommendation, for reasons outlined below. Instead, I can point you toward tribal authors who offer unique content and historiography. Allowing non-European cultures to define themselves within the context of their own tradition ways of knowing has been a revolutionary concept in archeology, ethnography, and history for at least half a century. But many academics (including myself!) still struggle with the day-to-day nuances of understanding different worldviews. These ideas of self-determination were part of the philosophy behind the Red Power movement in the 1950s and 60s. A landmark book expressing them is Custer Died For Your Sins by Vine Deloris Jr For an example of why Indians felt it was so important to tell their own history in their own voices, read Black Elk Speaks a book about Lakota spiritual belief, compiled and published in 1932 by a white author based on interviews conducted through a translator. There are problematic discrepancies between the interview transcripts and the book, apparently for the sake of romanticizing the \"noble savage.\" It is a valuable historical document, but perhaps says more about the era in which it was written than the era it purports to describe. I would also suggest The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven by Sherman Alexie and Heart Berries by Terese Marie Mailhot Both are semi-fictional autobiographies that describe modern Indian life, on and off the reservation. The stories show traditional cultural practices like feasting, dancing, and storytelling in context. They personalize the devastating effects of historical institutions like the reservations and boarding schools. Heart Berries is also simply one of the best books I have ever read, so I can\\'t recommend it highly enough.',\n",

       " \"This is a straightforward query, so I hope the mods won't mind me answering it concisely. The Dutch East India Company, or VOC, grouped its overseas stations into a series of regions, of which India and Japan were two. The majority of the trade conducted flowed to and from Europe, and the majority of transactions were made by trading European silver for Asian commodities. However, the VOC did also preside over inter-regional trade and, while it was hardly substantial, there was some demand for Indian (and to a much greater extent, Chinese) goods in Japan, which the VOC satisfied as part of its overall trade with the Tokugawa shogunate. Laver's recent book on gift-giving and diplomacy in Japan is by far your best resource for this aspect of the VOC's trade. He notes there was a fairly regular trade between the Dutch and Japan in colourfully dyed Indian fabrics, which were traded for copper. In addition, Laver points out that there was insatiable demand among Japanese elites for exotic gifts, comprising a wide range of novelties and curiosities, and some of these gifts were sourced from the VOC factories in India; the most exotic we have record of was an elephant. How accessible the main sources on this trade are to you will depend on whether or not you read Dutch. I would suggest the following as offering a good start to further research: Jaap S. Bruijn et al, Dutch-Asiatic shipping in the 17th and 18th centuries (3 vols, 1987-89) Adam Clulow, The Company and the Shogun: The Dutch Encounter with Tokugawa Japan E.M.

       " 'From 1910, Korean were typically internationally recognised as Japanese subjects. Even if the ethnic distinction between Koreans and Japanese was noted, Koreans were recognised as subjects of the Japanese Empire (and not citizens of Japan, if that made a difference). The Korean population in the US was small until the Korean War. Korean emigration to the US began in 1882, when the Treaty of Amity and Commerce was agreed between the US and Korea, and largely ended in 1905 when the Korean government banned emigration to the US. Under Japanese rule, Korean emigration to the US continued again, but in small numbers. When the US entered WWII, the Korean population of the US was about 7,000, most living in Hawaii. About 1/3 were aliens, and 2/3 were American-born citizens. Non-citizen Koreans were classified as enemy aliens, leading to protests by many of them: For years we\\'ve been fighting the Japanese and now they tell us that we\\'re Japs. It\\'s an insult and we refuse to be so classified! for example (quoted in Kim ), and Japanese say Koreans are Number One enemy to Japan, and our American friends put us on the enemy side, while we are trying to show our loyalty. ... It is really hard to understand. and Why should the alien Koreans be classified as enemies and let them pass the taint to their children, when they hate the Japs and taught their children to hate the Japs? (these two quotes from Macmillan ). In early February 1942, in response to those protests, the US Department of Justice removed restrictions that had been placed on enemy aliens who were Axis subjects (and not Axis citizens) living in the continental US. Thus, when the internment of Japanese-Americans began in late February, Koreans and Americans of Korean descent were not interned. The DOJ decision didn\\'t remove restrictions from Korean-Americans in Hawaii, but they (and Japanese-Americans in Hawaii) were not interned. Following the Cairo Declaration in November 1943, which stated, among other things, The aforesaid three great powers, mindful of the enslavement of the people of Korea, are determined that in due course Korea shall become free and independent. led to a new decision by the US government that Koreans were not enemy aliens, which changed the legal position of Korean-Americans, especially in Hawaii, but didn\\'t have much practical impact. Koreans did suffer from racism, including mistaken identification as Japanese. On Korean woman in Hawaii described the experience as: Everyone looks at me as though I\\'m Japanese and I feel so mad and guilty because I can\\'t change my face, and I have no way to tell them I\\'m just the opposite of Japanese. (from Kim ); \"the opposite of Japanese\" is a very Korean sentiment of the time, and being treated as Japanese and/or mistaken for being Japanese could be an emotionally painful experience. Korean-Americans typically supported the US war against Japan, some quite enthusiastically. Some strongly supported the internment of Japanese-Americans. Since some, or even much, of this sentiment was due to anti-Japanese feeling and desire for Korean independence, there was some suspicion of Korean motives: They are taking advantage of the present emergency to harp on the desire for independence. However, some viewed it quite positively, even when recognising the origin of some of these feelings: Of all peoples now aligned against Japan there can be no doubt as to the Korean people\\'s bitterness for that nation, and there can be no doubt as to the Korean people\\'s loyalty to the United States on whose victory they place their efforts and faith for the recovery of the Korean independence. (both quotes from Kim ). Some Korean-Americans served in WWII, but relatively few, only about 100 of the 4 and half thousand citizens of Korean descent - Japanese-Americans were about 7 times as likely to serve in the US armed forces. The best known Korean-Americans to serve were: 1. Young-Oak Kim, who you already noted, and whose patriotic and anti-racist comment in response to the offer of a transfer when the battalion commander realised he was Korean deserves to be better known: \"there are no Japanese nor Korean here.

He made movies throughout the war, frequently playing Japanese roles (as a villain, of course). After the war, his acting career continued, with his last movie in 1977.

       " 'Nobody ever lost his life in battle from the bite or kick of a horse. It is men who do what is done in battles. -- Xenophon, Anabasis 3.2.18 I\\'m not sure where you picked up the notion that horses have been described as lethal weapons throughout history. Xenophon, an Athenian soldier/philosopher/historian who lived c. 430-355 BC, is one of the oldest surviving experts on horses, horsemanship and cavalry tactics, and his view on the matter is clear from the passage above. Xenophon wrote an entire treatise on horsemanship and fighting on horseback - you can read it here - but never once says anything about the horse as a fighter. This is not to say there weren\\'t exceptions, including one famous example from the 490s BC, recorded by Herodotos: Now the horse which Artybios rode was trained to fight with infantrymen by rearing up. Hearing this, Onesilos said to his attendant, a Karian of great renown in war and a valiant man, \"I learn that Artybios\\' horse rears up and kicks and bites to death whomever he encounters. In light of this, decide and tell me straight away which you will watch and strike down: Artybios himself, or his horse.\" (...) As for the two generals, Artybios rode against Onesilos, who, as he had agreed with his attendant, dealt Artybios a blow as he bore down upon him. When the horse struck his hooves on Onesilos\\' shield, the Karian cut off the horse\\'s legs with a stroke of his curved sword. -- Hdt. 5.111-112 It seems at first glance that this is exactly what you\\'re talking about, but the only reason Herodotos would find this story worth retelling is because it was so unusual. Horses weren\\'t normally trained to fight, and this particular horse was a famous exception; its opponents had to take special precautions to defeat it. Most horses would not have been this aggressive, and their riders would mostly have tried to keep them out of range of edged weapons. Mounted combat in Ancient Greece could go to the lance or sword, but more commonly, cavalry fought at range with bows and javelins until the enemy ran away. It was only against a routing and defenceless enemy that they would press their advantage and get stuck in. As Xenophon\\'s treatise will tell you, the horses of the time were not large, nor were warhorses selected for size. Agility, durability and good character (willing obedience) were prioritised. Most cavalry mounts of history are much smaller than we think, and certainly smaller than the average horse today. Archaeological evidence shows that the average Greek horse (undifferentiated by role) stood about 130-140cm at the shoulder. Even breeds that were famous in Antiquity for their use as military mounts, like the Nisaean (from Parthia), were no bigger. They were also unshod. Indeed, most of the trappings of modern horseback riding postdate Classical Antiquity. Greek cavalry rode without stirrups or saddle. Persian and Macedonian cavalry was the same. (It is often argued that this was the reason for their skirmishing tactics, but this is clearly false, as many Greek and Persian horsemen did charge into battle with lances, and did so with enough force that their lances often broke on contact.) Xenophon should provide you with all you want to know about how Greek warhorses were selected. His treatise covers in great detail what physical traits and spirit a good horse should have, and how it should be trained for service in war. There are also some great general studies in modern scholarship if you\\'d like to know more: J.K. Anderson, Ancient Greek Horsemanship P. Sidnell, Warhorse: Cavalry in Ancient Warfare A.

       " \"1/2 I’m going to take this opportunity to expand on /u/Iphikrates answer, which is 100% accurate, as we would expect from them. There is really only a small window in the history of the military horse, where such training would even be plausible, for reasons u/Iphikrates touched on. From the genesis of mounted warriors (and even before, in the chariot age), there were three basic types of horse soldier; light missile armed, heavy shock, and mounted infantry. As u/Iphikrates said, for the first thousand years, give or take a century, light cavalry were overwhelmingly favored. Before the invention of the Roman four horned saddle, shock tactics were difficult against massed infantry. Lances were normally wielded two handed in this period, as a stabbing weapon, not couched under the armpit, and you could not very well expect good results riding bareback into a disciplined Macedonian phalanx, wielding 15 foot long sarissa. The bareback seat was not stable enough for such tactics, and it would be difficult to even get horses to do it. Shock cavalry tactics were not decisive in the ancient world. Light cavalry played a much more important role, and was the centerpiece of numerous ancient military systems, such as the Scythian and Parthian empires. These missile armed troops (javelins, bows and slings), performed hit and run attacks on massed infantry, charging, releasing a barrage of missiles as they wheeled away in formation, then regrouping and rearming. These attacks whittled away at the combat effectiveness of infantry, demoralized them, and tied them down so they could not maneuver or communicate effectively. Heavy cavalry did have a role. Nothing was better for exploitation. If an enemy formation broke, heavy cavalry could swiftly pour through the breach, running down fleeing soldiers, destroying command posts, and generally wreaking havoc. Their mobility also made them useful for flanking attacks, where they were less likely to face massed, disciplined, spearmen or bowmen. Although the Roman saddle greatly increased the combat capability of heavy cavalry against infantry, it did not really become a decisive arm in European warfare until the Medieval era. What changed to make heavy cavalry so effective? Essentially, it was a product of the de-professionalization of armies. The Romans practiced combined arms warfare. We think of them as heavy infantry centric, but in reality, every legion had attached light and heavy cavalry, artillery, and organic engineering components. This served them incredibly well as they expanded into empire. But when the Western empire decentralized, the ability to raise and train professional armies eroded. By the 11th century, at say the Battle of Hastings, we see armies of nobles and farmers, cobbled together on short notice, with no coordinated training at all. Men at arms were often exceptional individual fighters, who trained very hard at individual combat. But there was no way to teach them formation tactics, much less to teach their retainers and other assorted support troops advanced infantry tactics. This was an enormous advantage to heavy cavalry. Without disciplined, trained, and appropriately armed infantry formations opposing them, shock tactics became decisive. So in this period we see increasingly heavy and specialized cavalry, serving as the focal point of the battle. With that came a whole cult of the individual mounted warrior, with its own mythology, hierarchy, and specialization. Men at arms, and especially knights, were locus of military power. Well, sort of. In reality, the locus of military power was fortifications and siege. And that may sound counterintuitive, because cavalry are useless in siege. But, if you want to take a castle, you need an army, and to have an army you need to be able to raid, which is how armies were paid in that era, and destroy raiders, which is how you kept your wealth. If there was a set battle, it was often the result of a raid and counter, like Crecy. Under these conditions, we begin to see where the horse itself might be used as a weapon, in a melee with disorganized infantry. As u/Iphikrates mentioned, there was another medieval development that plays a potential role in your scenario: shoes. Today, we think of shoes as ubiquitous and necessary. But even after their invention, horses outside of Europe continued to work and fight under a wide variety of conditions, barefoot. Why did the European develop shoes, and why were the Mongols able to fight them just as effectively barefoot? Well, in addition to the rise of heavy cavalry, Medieval Europe also saw the preeminence of permanent fortifications. War horses, and increasingly horses in general, moved inside the castle walls, where they lived in stalls, with diminished freedom of movement. Horses evolved to constantly move. Their foraging habits, digestive system, and hoof structure rely on constant motion. When stalling became the norm, digestive and hoof problems radically increased. A horse standing in its own waste all day, rather than wandering over varied terrain, will start to lose hoof integrity. Walking trims the hoof, toughens it, increases blood flow, and allows the horse to self treat inflammation by standing in cold streams (which mustangs will do in the spring when they are at risk of laminitis). Our old friend Xenophon had something to say about this too. While the Greeks did not stable to the extent our knightly friends would, and had a more amenable climate for it, he describes both the problem and the remedy, “But if food and exercise with a view to strengthening the horse's body are matters of prime consideration, no less important is it to pay attention to the feet. A stable with a damp and smooth floor will spoil the best hoof which nature can give. To prevent the floor being damp, it should be sloped with channels; and to avoid smoothness, paved with cobble stones sunk side by side in the ground and similar in size to the horse's hoofs. A stable floor of this sort is calculated to strengthen the horse's feet by the mere pressure on the part in standing. In the next place it will be the groom's business to lead out the horse somewhere to comb and curry him; and after his morning's feed to unhalter him from the manger, so that he may come to his evening meal with greater relish. To secure the best type of stable-yard, and with a view to strengthening the horse's feet, I would suggest to take and throw down loosely four or five waggon loads of pebbles, each as large as can be grasped in the hand, and about a pound in weight; the whole to be fenced round with a skirting of iron to prevent scattering. The mere standing on these will come to precisely the same thing as if for a certain portion of the day the horse were, off and on, stepping along a stony road; whilst being curried or when fidgeted by flies he will be forced to use his hoofs just as much as if he were walking. Nor is it the hoofs merely, but a surface so strewn with stones will tend to harden the frog of the foot also.” (contd. below)\",\n",
       " 'I\\'m assuming that a person who was \"inspired by humanism,\" or could be considered a humanist fits into one of three categories: 1. They privilege human action over divine action, 2. They use a method of understanding the world that relies more on textual reading than scholastic reasoning, 3. They belong to a network that did either one of these things. In either of these definitions, Martin Luther was not a humanist; he was every bit the medieval scholastic in mind and training. The entire story around the 95 Theses happened (or Luther says it did) demonstrates this state of mind. Luther wanted a disputation, so he called for one by nailing a series of premises on the door to the Wittenberg chapel. Thomas Aquinas would have found this procedure totally normal. Other members of the early Reformation certainly ran in humanist circles. Philip Melanchthon, Luther\\'s right hand man, was well known for his \"circle\" of German Christian intellectuals, who readily passed around various treatises on religious matters. Latter luminaries in the Lutheran tradition such as Martin Bucer were likewise humanistic in their thinking. Ulrich Zwingli and Johan Oecolampadius, the founders of the Reformed tradition, were likewise inspired by the writings of Erasmus (much to Erasmus\\' chagrin). On the Catholic side, Erasmus is obviously the humanist that gets the most recognition, but his commentaries on the New Testament were themselves rooted in work that had already been done by Cardinal Ximenes de Cisneros and the scholars at the University of Alcala. Ignatius of Loyola and the first generation of Jesuits may have been trained in a very medieval Thomistic style of scholasticism at Paris, but later generations included people like Robert Bellarmine in Rome (most famous for disputing with Galileo) who would have been more humanistic in their outlook than scholastic. That being said, one could argue that Luther and other reformers (Protestant and Catholic) achieved the success they did due to the printing press, the primary technological innovation of the Renaissance which made humanism possible as an intellectual movement. Carlos Eire\\'s Reformation: Early Modern Europe has the most approachable coverage on the various different reform movements, as well as the methods that the individual reformers ascribed to.',\n",
       " 'I don\\'t _think_ Edison was ever a patent clerk; I think you are confused about that. (_Einstein_ was a patent clerk, if that\\'s what you\\'re thinking of.) But Edison certainly did pay attention to what was being patented, and maintained his own miniature patent library at his laboratory in Menlo Park. Many inventors pay close attention to other patent filings, and indeed the entire point of patent filings is to give publicity about the invention in exchange for a temporary monopoly, under the idea that the publicity will spur innovation. What Edison and his employees would do is look at inventions patented and look for good ideas that weren\\'t quite there yet — ideas that seems promising but the inventor hadn\\'t figured out how to make them work, or had missed something important, or just hadn\\'t thought it all the way through. Then they would see if they could remix that idea and get something novel out of it. This isn\\'t copying. It\\'s innovation. We have a myth about how innovation works, in which geniuses come up with new ideas wholly unthought of, and change everything in a single invention, etc. It\\'s nonsense and bears little resemblance to the history of science and technology, in which every idea has an antecedent and there are always at least a few smart people thinking along very similar lines at any point in history. That doesn\\'t mean that they all have exactly the same idea — sometimes the one \"genius\" is the one who takes the idea just a step further than the others — but it does mean that our sense of how ideas work is generally wrong, because we don\\'t teach people about the other people who had very similar ideas (you probably know something about Einstein\\'s ideas, but you probably have never been taught about Poincaré\\'s work in similar areas, and the differences between Einstein and Poincaré that made Einstein Einstein and Poincaré Poincaré, but historians look at these things). So does attention to patent filings matter in the history of invention? Definitely! There are many examples of this, and any firm today of sufficient size keeps close eye on the patents of their competitors. Is this \"stealing\"? No. It is 100% legal and encouraged — it is the entire point of open patent filings. Does it mean that our idea of what kind of \"geniuses\" inventors are is frequently erroneous? It does! But not for the reason you\\'re saying — it\\'s not because they\\'re bad inventors, it\\'s because invention doesn\\'t work the way we like to mythologize it. Separately, with Edison, many of his patents were patents taken out in his name by employees. This kind of corporate patenting is not uncommon, though Edison\\'s approach — assigning them to him personally — is unusual. But it was part of his mystique, building himself up as a \"lone inventor.\" Is it nonsense? Definitely. That doesn\\'t mean that Edison didn\\'t accomplish incredible things. Historians are frequently more impressed with Edison\\'s work as a _system builder_ than an inventor — the lightbulb wasn\\'t such an incredible thing by itself (his was just an economical variant on an idea that had been tried many times before), it was the fact that he used the lightbulb _to sell people on the idea of electrifying their homes_, which built up the modern electrical network. That\\'s the part of Edison that made him so dominant, in the end — he didn\\'t just invent things (or pay people to invent things in his name), he actually got those _things_ into every house in the world, and that\\'s the hardest part of technological innovation, it turns out (most patents are never commercialized, much less turn into ubiquitous objects in our lives).',\n",

       " \"The Royal Navy did not abandon dive bombing, as such. Throughout the war, it operated strike aircraft capable of making dive bombing attacks, although they were not designed solely for the purpose. It started the war with the Skua, a dive-bomber/fighter. This had several successes in the dive-bombing role, most notably the sinking of Konigsberg during the German invasion of Norway. However, it was a poor fighter, and was retired from frontline service in 1941 as a result. After this, the Fleet Air Arm's strike capability centred on its TSR (Torpedo Strike Reconnaisance) aircraft. The Swordfish and Albacore, with their low speed, could be used for dive bombing, albeit at shallower angles of dive than purpose-built dive bombers. The Swordfish was commonly used for this task in the Mediterranean. Notably, of the 21 Swordfish that raided the Italian base at Taranto in November 1940, five were tasked with making dive-bombing attacks on cruisers and destroyers in the anchorage of the Mare Piccolo. Four more had the primary task of dropping flares to illuminate the harbour, with the secondary task of dive bombing targets of opportunity. The successor to the Swordfish and Albacore was the Fairey Barracuda. Like the earlier aircraft, this was a multirole aircraft, capable of dropping both torpedoes and dive bombing. The Barracuda was fitted with large Fairey-Youngman flaps. These, as well as giving it good low-speed performance for landing on carriers, had a special setting which allowed them to serve as dive brakes. Again, this capability was often used. Barracudas made dive-bombing attacks against Tirpitz in the Norwegian fjords, and against Japanese targets in the Far East. While all of these aircraft were able to dive bomb, none of them had been designed solely for this, unlike their foreign counterparts. The Skua was a dive bomber and fighter, while the Swordfish, Albacore and Barracuda were also torpedo bombers and reconnaissance aircraft. The reason for this multi-role focus largely lies in the pre-war system of procurement for British naval aircraft. Between 1918 and 1939, the Fleet Air Arm was a part of the Royal Air Force, under the auspices of the Air Ministry. The Air Ministry was largely responsible for the procurement of naval aircraft. The Navy (from 1924) set the requirements for new naval aircraft, but the Air Ministry set the numbers of aircraft that were to be purchased. The Air Ministry was more interested in strategic bombing than in naval aviation, and so tended to underfund the Fleet Air Arm. The RN never got as many aircraft as it wanted. This meant that the RN tended to build carriers with smaller aviation contingents than the USN or IJN did. It also affected the specifications the RN set for new aircraft. As the RN had comparatively few aircraft, it needed to maximise the capabilities of the aircraft it did have. This was done by making the aircraft multi-role, capable of doing more than one job. That said, the RN definitely preferred torpedo bombing as a means of attacking ships. The torpedo was a more damaging weapon, and more versatile. Dive bombers could only damage an unarmoured target. Torpedoes could be used against any sort of ship. A bomb could start fires and damage a ship's superstructure, but was unlikely to do damage that would sink a ship. Torpedoes, which damaged a ship's hull directly, were much more likely to sink a ship. Dive bombers required a long, steady approach at high altitude, making them vulnerable to fighters and flak. Torpedo bombers, meanwhile, could take more evasive action during their approach; British doctrine for torpedo attacks called for the attacking aircraft to make rapid, extreme changes in height and bearing. Dive bombing attacks were harder to make at night, especially against moving ships. However, this approach would soften as the war progressed and the British learned from American experience in the Pacific. The RN's appreciation of the Battle of Midway suggested that dive bombers were much more important for fighting carriers; the damage done by dive bombers would neutralise the carrier's ability to launch aircraft, while the torpedo was only useful to finish them off. The conclusion of the report indicated that in future, carriers should carry more dive bombers than torpedo bombers.\",\n",
       " 'Hi there, This subject is barely touched and it can be a bit confusing even then because of all the names, years, what counts as a war, what doesn\\'t, etc. These conflicts, treaties, and events surrounding them all, directly influenced the trajectory of Native American cultures across the entirety of North and Central America, the birth of the United States, and unravelling of the British Empire in the Americas, and I\\'ll never understand why it isn\\'t taught. Nutshell version of the answer to your question: When French & Indian War (singular) is used, it pretty much only refers to the North American campaign of the Seven Years\\' War from 1754-1763, so yes, F&I was a part of Seven Years\\' War. Just think of it as \"same war, different continents.\" Somewhat in-depth version: It\\'s not generally agreed upon how many wars there were. I personally would count 6 total \"real\" colonial wars with endings resulting in some form of treaty fought in North America. Most were associated with various European wars happening at the same time. In the Americas there is the French & Indian Wars (plural) which was the series of 4 wars lasting from 1688 to 1763. All 4 had European and North American campaigns, and the European and American campaigns also had different names. Along with the 4 F&I\\'s, there was Dummer\\'s and Le Loutre\\'s Wars which were both fought over the control of land covering Nova Scotia, and Eastern Quebec and Maine (called Acadia at the time.) There were several other random battles and such, and some pretty aggressive activity in the Caribbean, but for the sake of time and information overload I\\'ll skip most of that and stick with everything in mainland North America only. I\\'ll also only use the United States term for each one because there are like 5 different names for each of these wars depending on who you ask.

       " \"This is a really, really good question I have never really thought of before. In general, there has been a trend of preserving royal clothing - to re-use, to display or to give away parts or whole suits to show favour to royal favourites (much cheaper than giving expensive gifts, coin or land) - Queen Kristina used to give away riding gloves in this way. Combine this with a certain historical luck in which Stockholm and Uppsala has not suffered an enemy occupation since 1521 and more clothing has survived than in many other places. I am sure someone better qualified than me can answer in detail why more clothing has not survived in countries such as England and France. That said, we can talk a bit about the pieces you mention. When it comes to the Sture murders of Count Svante Stensson Sture and his sons Erik Svantesson Sture and Nils Svantesson Sture, as the mortal remains of the dead were turned over to the widow of Svante and mother of Erik and Nils, Countess Märta Eriksdotter Leijonhufvud, by historical accounts a decisive and strong personality, used to handling the estates and economical and administraive issues of the family when (which was often) her husband was away on duties assigned by King Erik XIV. She had the clothes of the victims carefully removed and stored at the Uppsala Cathedral. Considering she was polically savvy, demanded and recieved a hefty payout (1 000 mark, or 270kg of pure silver in bars) as penance for the murders along with a letter of absolvement for the three murdered and would use the silver to mint coin to finance the coup of Erik XIV's brothers Karl and Johan. As to why Märta chose to preserve the clothes is not entirely known - she writes later of her sorrow and the 'accursed' silver she received in penance. Considering her political savvy, it might be that she wanted to keep them as a potential source of propaganda, to show should she need to gather support to oppose King Erik XIV, or simply for nostalgic reasons. They were stored with other treasures or keepsakes at the Uppsala Cathedral, where people in need of fine cloth or with an interest to reuse things would not be allowed. They might also have been kept around for the same potential propaganda reasons by Johan III and Karl IX (the coupmakers) as Erik XIV's queen and son were alive for quite some time and might potentially become a problem. As for Gustav II Adolf's shirt and mooseleather buffcoat (and the mounted and stuffed remains of his horse, Streiff), they were taken as trophies of war and preserved as such at the best of the Holy Roman Emperor and were returned to Sweden as a gift from Austria in gratitude for the services the Swedish Red Cross had provided for Austrian wounded during and immediately after ww1. Karl XII's uniform was brought back with his body and taken off during the embalming of the mortal remains of the King and transported to Stockholm along with the rest of the King's personal items and then placed in the Royal Armoury collection 1730, when it shows up on inventory lists for the first time. Gustav III's clothes from the ball where he was shot were thoroughly examined as part of the very effective investigation carried out by the chief of the Stockholm police, Liljensparre, and then immediately brought to the Royal Armoury to be preserved there. Once again, political considerations might have been the cause - the King survived for 13 days after being shot, and wanted to ensure the Gustavian absolutism he had introduced througha coup in 1772 and his legacy and the regency for his young son, Gustav IV Adolf. Preserving his clothes, like Karl XII's were, could have figured as a potential propaganda tool in the ongoing conflict between the power of the Monarch and the Nobility of Sweden, of which the murder was just the latest in a long row of struggles for primacy.\",\n",
       " \"One thing to note is that, in ancient Chinese history, a dynasty didn't fall due to misfortune in natural events (famines, early deaths) or long term administrative weaknesses but due to moral failings that led to the mandate of heaven leaving to a worthier figure. The natural causes? A sign heaven had turned against the dynasty and its ruler due to said moral failings, figures like Ban Gu and Sima Biao listed bad omens from heaven that they blamed on females or eunuchs. The last ruler (or if a puppet so can't really be blamed then the last ruler in power) or two are the ones that doomed the empire, not necessarily because they lacked talent but that their attitudes and actions, so lacking in virtue, cost heaven's support. It justified the change of power and legitimized the new regime whose founder was, of course, a worthy ruler and a complete contrast to the Emperor he conquered. It didn't have to be down to a woman, eunuchs were also a favourite scapegoat. In the Han and three kingdoms, there wasn't one wicked concubine failing charge though charges of too large a harem were commonplace (Emperor Huan, Ling, Liu Shan, Cao Rui, Cao Fang who really gets charged with vice, Sun Quan, Sun Hao) and were linked to the fall. Other charges listed against Emperor's for the dynastic falls often of listening to the wrong people and general indulgence and vice. Modern historians may argue some of that was slander, some of it was overblown criticism and rather attribute issues to, say, tax policy, unbalanced power dynamics, events beyond their control. However, falling to the wiles of a female allowed for several things. The ruler is uncontrolled in his desires and it doesn't have to be just with her but with spending and lavishness expenses, the ruler lacks the will of self-restraint. That the ruler is weak at heart, that he can't separate his home life from his duty, he can't control his household so how can he have controlled an Empire. The ruler losing focus on his real duties of rulership, the ruler listening to the advice of a woman rather than his gentry advisers (who are thus not to blame) with whom he should have listened. The ruler has subverted heaven's natural order by giving such free reign to a woman, that the correct balance between Yin and Yang was out of balance. Such falls served as a lesson for current and future rulers, be restrained, do not give in too much to your desires, listen to your gentry rather than any other figures, obey the natural order of things. Don't give too much power to the women or to their families, even if they were of sufficient background to be acceptable. If a ruler was too interested in his harem or a woman was too powerful then you could use the examples of the past. If the last ruler wasn't obsessed with a concubine and you really disliked him, you could just borrow stories of the past and use it as seems to have happened with the last ruler of Wu Sun Hao, wit and accused brutal tyrant. If the tale wasn't good enough, like Daji the consort of Zhou the last King of Shang, then in your biography of women, change it to make it worse like Liu Xiang having her laugh during the heated pole punishment and switching who wanted to see Bi Gan's heart to her rather then the Emperor. Or Wei officer Zhan Qian, seeking to object to Cao Pi's choice of Empress in Guo, that Zhou burnt people alive to amuse her. As mentioned by u/huianxin the novel romance of the three kingdoms also played into that. The comparing and contrasting between Liu Bei, who shrugs off the loss of family for more important matters of state, with Lu Bu who commits an act of unfilial treachery due to the wiles of a woman and ignores his wise councillor Chen Gong due to the emotional appeals of his women. Or in the battle of Wan, concentrates on the issue with Cao Cao sleeping with Zhang Xiu's widowed aunt and makes it the main reason for the revolt that cost Cao Cao his eldest son, nephew and bodyguard. Empress and Consorts by Robert Cutter and William Cromwell has a good section in chapter 3 on how Han writers sought to assert the primacy of males and altered tales.\",\n",
       " '&#x200B; Note Unless otherwise hyperlinked, all facts within this comment came from Owen Matthews excellent book “An Impeccable Spy”, which covers the life of Sovet agent Richard Sorge, including his own important involvement with the events in this article. This bit is also fairly dramatised, as I was originally going to submit it for publishing as an online article (so take note of the overly rhetorical bits and ignore them). November 11th, 1940. Steaming roughly 340 kilometers north-west of Sumatra, the S.S Automedon was bound for Penang (then a crucial strategic port in British Malaya) when she was spotted and pursued by the German surface raider Atlantis, disguised as the British auxiliary cruiser Antenor. Before the Automedon could send a distress signal, shells from the Atlantis decimated her bridge, immediately killing all senior British officers onboard. After storming the decks and capturing the remaining crew, the Kriegsmarine boarding party discovered the treasure the Automedon was carrying: 15 bags of top-secret mail for the British Far East Command based in Singapore. Among the other precious correspondence (which included the newest Royal Navy fleet codes, $6 million in Malayan dollars, and the latest fleet orders) was a mysterious green bag, labelled “Safe Hands - British Master Only”. The box, which was weighed down with lead to allow for a quick disposal in case of attack, contained a critical report by the British War Cabinet’s Planning Division addressed to Air Chief-Marshal Robert Brooke-Popham (British C-in-C of the Far East). The report would soon become the match in the tinderbox for Imperial Japan’s Pacific strategies, and set in motion the chain of decisions leading to the IJN’s attack on Pearl Harbour more than a year later. ‘This is of the utmost importance’ The report found aboard the Automedon stated conclusively that the British armed forces would be unable to reinforce any of their holdings in the Far East, as they neither possessed the available manpower or ships to send to Brooke-Popham’s aid. In effect, the report stated that should Japan attack Singapore, Hong Kong, and Malaya, it would be up to the defenders to repulse any attacks, without hope of reinforcement. When this report alongside the other Automedon documents were dispatched to Berlin, Hitler immediately wrote in the margins ‘this is of the utmost importance’, and authorised the German embassy in Tokyo to share them with the Japanese. He and his staff hoped that it would finally persuade the Japanese government to launch their expansions into Southeast Asia, an event that would assist Nazi Germany’s war efforts considerably. But why exactly? Ever since the Wehrmacht had pushed the British back to their Home Islands, the two thorns in the side of Hitler’s dreams of European conquest were the RAF and the Royal Navy. The former, it was hoped, could be neutralised by sustained Luftwaffe bombings of their facilities and manufacturing plants. The latter however, proved far more problematic. Hitler’s surface fleet could not hope to take on the might of the Royal Navy, and though the U-boats of the Kriegsmarine were sinking tonnes of precious supplies out in the Atlantic, the threat of British naval supremacy loomed over the English Channel. Hitler’s generals cautioned that so long as the Royal Navy maintained superiority, the cross-channel invasion of the UK (code-named Operation Sealion) might not even reach the cliffs of Dover. So Hitler and his commanders turned to Japan. Attack Singapore Specifically, Germany wanted Japan to strike south against British Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaya. With the Royal Navy then preoccupied with sending reinforcements to deal with the Japanese Navy (which posed far more of a threat than the Kriegsmarine could), the Germans could attempt to wrest control of the English Channel and clear the seas (and skies) for Operation Sealion. This was far easier said than done. The Japanese armed forces were engaged in their own internal battles. On one side, the “Control Group” opposed a German-Japanese alliance, a result of the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with the Soviet Union. Opposing them were the hardline militarists of the “Action Group”, who believed that the German government would prove a strong ally in Japan’s coming war; Tokyo at this time was still neutral, despite having signed the Tripartite Pact in September 1940. Both groups knew that the defeat of the Netherlands by Hitler’s Blitzkrieg meant that the precious oil and rubber resources of the Dutch East Indies were vulnerable and ripe for the taking, but the perceived threat of the Royal Navy worried even the most hardline expansionists. In the eyes of Hitler and his subordinates, the Automedon papers would prove Britain’s weaknesses in the Far East, and provide the necessary justification for Japan to push into Southeast Asia. Crucially this prediction ignored a critical factor: America. Japanese naval planners (including a promising Isoroku Yamamoto) knew that any expansionist maneuvers in the Pacific would likely result in both Britain and America bringing their navies to bear against the IJN, a showdown which would be disastrous. Now though, with Britain unable to reinforce its smaller Far East Command, the Automedon papers reassured Japanese commanders of a truth contrary to Hitler’s hopes: that Britain would be powerless to stop Japan’s efforts to strike south, and that America remained the only true threat to their plans of Asian domination. With this information, Yamamoto ordered his planners to begin drawing up top-secret plans for a pre-emptive strike at the United States, centered around a massive carrier-attack on the American naval base at Oahu, home to the feared American Pacific Fleet. In sum, the Automedon papers did not lead to the desired Japanese invasions of Singapore or other British holdings in Asia, but it did convince Yamamoto and the rest of the admirals that their main priority target was the United States Navy. The Automedon papers would soon be of use again in January 1941, and this time with the effect that Hitler had intended it to have in the first place. With Yamamoto’s ultra-secret plans still in the works, the papers were used to cross-check an intercepted signal from “Fortress Singapore”, complaining about the poor state of the garrison there. Japan’s general and admirals saw an opportunity to strike...',\n",

In January of 1939, Prime Minister (and Prince) Fumimaro Konoe resigned his government position over the failure of the Japanese army to break the stalemate which had developed in China.^ He was followed by three men over the next eighteen months: right-wing bureaucrat Hiranuma Kiichiro, General Abe Nobuyuki, and Admiral Yonai Mitsumasa.^ All three had a clear problem on their hands: Japan was already bogged down in continental war with China, but the government (heavily influenced by the military) was well aware that further threats surrounding the island nation. To the north was the Soviet Union, a nation which Japan had sought to prevent from existing by dispatching troops to fight against the Reds in the Russian Civil War.^ To the south and across the Pacific were Britain and the United States respectively, each fielding powerful navies which threatened the IJN’s own fleets. There was no question that Japan’s warpath would eventually set it against all four of these threats. But as R.A.C Parker notes, the internal debate was on: “Timing and priorities; how far existing resources should be first developed, how far and to where they should be extended, which threats should first be countered and when.”^ Within this sphere of geopolitical debate, we have the emergence of two key ‘schools’. The first were the proponents of the Hokushin-ron (Northern Expansion Doctrine), which believed that the Soviet Union and its Siberian regions were the next prime target for Japan’s expansion.^ Prominent members of this group included PM Hiranuma himself, officers in the IJA, and war minister Seishiro Itagaki. Opposing them were the proponents of the Nanshin-ron (Southern Expansion Doctrine), which believed that the European colonies of British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies were the next prime targets for Japan’s expansion.^ Prominent members in this group included PM and former navy minister Yonai Mitsumasa, as well as admirals in the IJN.^ This army-navy dichotomy is actually a theme that has occurred before in Japan’s political discourse, so I shall quote Andrew Gordon here on the usual split between the IJN and IJA. “The army saw the greatest threat to Japan’s Asian hegemony—and the greatest opportunities to solve the problem—residing in China, especially North China and Manchuria. The navy focused its concerns on rival Western powers in the Pacific.”^ Both directions of expansion also had their problems, and it was these considerations alongside Japan’s reaction to external events which would ultimately sway the direction of the government. For Hokushin-ron, Japanese forces had lost the disastrous Nomonhan Incident, otherwise known as the “Battle of Khalkhin Gol” with the Soviet Union. This border skirmish took place in May of 1939, and it cost the Kwantung Army some 12,000 men dead or wounded. In addition to the German betrayal of Japan following the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, caused Tokyo to shift critically towards Nanshin-ron. Historian Owen Matthews on the significance of Nomonhan: “The humiliation of the Kwangtung Army strengthened the hand of the ‘South Strike’ Nanshin-ron Group - led by the navy - who argued for Japan to attack its Asian neighbors and leave the USSR alone. The Japanese reluctance to risk another trouncing at the hands of the Red Army would become a major factor in the outcome of the coming world war.”^ Mind you, Tokyo also knew that Nanshin-ron was not exactly a cakewalk through Southeast Asia. As Historian Owen Matthews writes, their main opposition was externally based: “Their the Imperial Navy’s two main obstacles were the British Royal Navy, operating a force far more powerful from Japan’s from the apparently impregnable base of Singapore, and the US Pacific Fleet out of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.”^ The debate then, rested on which threat to combat first, and when to best strike. For those decisions, the military planners in Tokyo watched and waited as the Second World War in Europe developed. A Chance to Strike? With the Fall of France and the seemingly inevitable Nazi invasion of Britain, the Japanese government gained its own concessions in Southeast Asia, notably by securing the precious resources and territory of French Indochina (by essentially forcing Vichy France to agree to practical rule of the colony).^ When Japanese forces formally moved into the area, America responded with a potential death blow: an oil embargo. 90% of Japan’s oil supply came from foreign imports, and 75% of that supply came from the United States.^ Roosevelt had issued a clear warning through this freeze. Gordon on the Japanese options: “It the Japanese government faced a difficult choice. It could agree to American conditions for lifting the embargo by retreating completely from China. Or it could follow the hawks and track the United States and British, taking control of the Southeast Asian oil fields by force and hopping to negotiate for a cease-fire from that strengthened position.”^ The military was also aware of just how lethal this embargo was. Here’s an extract from a report pursuing the case for war following the embargo: “oil is the weak point of our Empire’s national strength and fighting power… We are now gradually consuming oil that has been stockpiled…We will be self-sufficient for two years at most. This will be less if we carry out larger-scale military operations… our Empire will become powerless militarily.”^ Then on June 22nd, a fateful cable from Ambassador Oshima (stationed in Berlin) arrived at Imperial headquarters: the Third Reich had launched Operation Barbarossa, and now the Soviets were in a full-blown war against Hitler's regime. To the Japanese planners, this now added a new dimension and avenue for expansion. Should the Japanese honour their alliance with Germany and attack the Soviet Far East? Or should they bide their time and wait for further developments? Minister of Foreign Affairs Yosuke Matsuoka certainly thought the former was the best option (despite having signed a non-aggression pact with the Soviets two months earlier).^ So strong was his belief that Japan should attack north first, then south, that he personally requested an audience with Emperor Hirohito, and the decision makers in Tokyo met a few days later to review his proposal.^\",\n",
       " 'There were different laws and customs in every regions of Western Europe at the time. However, here is how you can explain things to your 8 years old daughter :-) I tried to lay it out as simply as possible. # 1. Not everybody was equal One thing that is true of the Middle Ages is that equality among people wasn\\'t even a concept and even less of a fact. Social hierarchy was paramount. However, we have many examples of people trying to break out from it. The system put in place just didn\\'t work and couldn\\'t last. Eventually it collapsed as history showed. # 2. Lords ruled over their land(s) and the people inhabiting it The medieval era moved on from a period of landowners who relied on slaves as a workforce to plough their fields. Free men were scarce. However, the early troubles that accompanied the end of the Western Roman Empire and more unsettling grand events in more recent centuries helped the \"little people\" to break from their former shackles. Slaves became serfs, which granted more lee-way and rights. However, they were still explicitly forbidden to leave their lord\\'s domain. # 3. Serfs couldn\\'t leave the land of their ruler... but they tried! If serfs were caught trying to escape from their lord\\'s land they\\'d be punished for it. They were considered as belongings. They could be borrowed or bought. They only had a few days for themselves each week to work their own field. Otherwise they were called on by their lord to work his field or they had to respect rest days and attend church celebrations (they were so many \"holidays\" by the end of the 15th century that people actively fought to get the right to work by the Early Modern Era). Nevertheless, serfs did try to escape from their condition or to improve it. We have a few charters explicitly ruling that any serf that had lived within a town for a year and a day were freed from their former ties to their lords and couldn\\'t be pursued anymore. This started to happen more and more by the 11th century. When they couldn\\'t escape individually and seek out a better life in a nearby city, serfs united, put their money together and straight out attempted to buy their own freedom. Revolts could happen but they were more scarce than we\\'d like to believe. More often than not, diplomacy was favoured in the Middle Ages (or we wouldn\\'t have so many charters to decypher!). There were, of course, a few revolts but they weren\\'t the rule and they almost always ended badly for the rebels. They didn\\'t only belonged to lay lords, but also to ecclesiastic congregations. The \"lord\" could be an abbot or a party of canons. I just wanted to remind that fact :-) # 4. There were no serfs in Normandy, yet... Normandy stood out as one of the few French duchies were there were no serfs, as early as the 11th century. Nevertheless, peasants in precarious economic situations didn\\'t roam the land freely for there were great risks from leaving your community and your support system (unless you went away briefly on a pilgrimage, which was a well-established and insitutionalized kind of peregrination). People in the Middle Ages relied heavily on their community and had closer ties to their neighbours and relatives than we have today. Leaving a land because of an unfair lord even if you were free to do it came a great cost! # 5. If you came back after you left, you needed to obtain a pardon to clear your case During the Hundred Years\\' War and when there was two kings for a single throne (Charles VII and Henry VI), some people moved out as armies marched on cities and took them. Out of such ordeals we have kepts a few letters of pardon. People who fled Rouen or Paris and then tried to move back in before the city was taken back had to ask a formal letter of pardon to move back in. This is a very specific example but it leads to show you how little freedom of movement people could enjoy. You couldn\\'t travel on a whim nor move out to another city without a concrete plan and the back up of the authorities. # 6. Merchants relied on laissez-passer and paid (lots) of taxes What about trade? Merchants did roam the land but they had to request \"laissez-passer\" to cross a lord\\'s land safely. The count of Champagne was famous for such letters during the 12th and 13th century, at the height of the Champagne fair. Not only would he allow merchants on his land but he\\'d also ensure their safety military wise. He understood how much money was to be made out of international fairs and he worked his best to turn them into a regular opportunity for merchants to come into his county and commerce there. Lords did build fortified bridges to facilitate the passage or access to their lands, mostly around the 14th century. However, every road taken or any bridge crossed came with a tax. Therefore merchants, instead of travelling from Spain to England or beyond, for example, mostly specialized in shorter back-and-forth trips where they had good working relations. They were also often forced to stop and sell their goods in a few cities (this is what we call \"staple privileges\", talked about in a previous contribution of mine # In conclusion Overall, social and economic mobility was decided by lords though we have to consider the preexisting constraints of a peasant\\'s living condition first. Lords could encourage mobility (and they did it a lot in the 12th and 13th century, founding cities and freeing serfs left and right to boost trade on their land) but they could also opt out for a more conservative approach. Serfs and free peasants didn\\'t always abide to the rule of their lords. They often collectively tried to sweeten it with a deal or they revolted in the worst case scenario. A few people just fled the land they were tied to but they had to renounce their community and forego their supportive system while doing so. Pilgrimages were very frequent, though, and the medieval society was far more mobile than we tend to believe at first glance. Nevertheless mobility remained a privilege more than a common and universal right. Not every body could travel as far and wide as Albert the Great, a well respected bishop and man of the Church.',\n",

       " 'The Japanese did build some cheap carriers. Most were originally passenger liners before their conversion to carriers. Liners provided a reasonable starting point, since they provided a large hull with reasonably high speed. Some of the liners used had been designed with the intent to make them easy to convert to carriers (and their construction subsidised by the navy). One class of three planned ships (of which one was completed) were converted from tankers, and one carrier was converted from a cargo ship. The four smallest of these converted carriers (the tanker and cargo ship conversions noted above, and the two smallest liner conversions) were not large enough to operate combat aircraft suitable for carrier warfare. Their flight decks were only a little over 100m long, too short to land combat aircraft such as fighters, dive bombers, or torpedo bombers. They could operate short-landing aircraft, such as the spotter aircraft Kokusai Ki-76 \"Stella\" (similar to the German Storch), and in principle the Kayaba Ka-1 autogyro (supply of these aircraft being the problem). Their typical complement was 8 Ki-76s, intended to support landing operations. Three of these ships were not pure carriers, but landing ships with flight decks - in addition to aircraft, they carried landing craft. Only the first of these 3 ships came into service before the Battle of Midway, so they had little opportunity for use as landing ships. They were used as aircraft ferries, taking aircraft to land bases (they could take off from the short flight deck, and didn\\'t need to land), and were able to ferry 30 to 37 aircraft at a time. The two liner-conversion carrier-landing ships were sunk while in use as troopships, and the cargo-conversion one was completed at the end of March 1945 and survived the war without significant action. The tanker-conversion carrier was intended to provide air cover for convoys, for protection against submarines, but was sunk in harbour by air attack 3 weeks after being commissioned in 1945. The five larger liner-conversions had a hanger (important for being able to keep the flight deck clear enough to land aircraft), and could operate 24 aircraft (except 1 which could operate 27). They lacked arrestor gear, which meant that they couldn\\'t land aircraft quickly enough for carrier battles, so the operated as aircraft ferries and convoy escorts. Two were sunk by submarines while operating as convoy escorts, and two were sunk by submarines while operating as aircraft ferries. The fifth was sunk by air attack in harbour. Each conversion generally took between 6 months and 1 year. More ships like these wouldn\\'t have helped Japan in carrier battles. First, as they lacked arrestor gear and/or long enough flight decks, they couldn\\'t operate aircraft usefully for carrier battles. Second, they were slow compared to fleet carriers, and this would have limited their ability to operate with such carriers. Third, the Japanese bottleneck wasn\\'t the number of carriers, but adequately training enough pilots to replace the losses in carrier battles such as Coral Sea and the grinding attrition in the air battles in the Solomons. The Great Marianas Turkey Shoot demonstrated the futility of simply throwing large numbers of barely-trained unskilled pilots at powerful US carrier forces. Notably, in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the Japanese used their carriers as bait to draw away the US fleet carriers (and most battleships), to give the Japanese battleships a chance to close with and sink the invasion fleet (the decoy carriers did their job well, but the Japanese battleships failed to make use of the opportunity to sink the invasion fleet). Japan did need aircraft ferries and convoy escorts, so these ships performed useful service. The five large converted carriers were the three Taiyō-class carriers (Taiyō, Unyō, Chūyō), Kaiyō, and Shin\\'yō (Shin\\'yō was converted from a German liner stranded in Japan by the outbreak of the war). The 3 landing ship-carriers were Akitsu Maru, Nigitsu Maru, and Kumano Maru (the last originally a cargo ship), and the tanker-conversion convoy escort was Yamashio Maru. These last four ships were owned by the Army rather than the Navy, explaining their more limited role and their names.',\n",
       " '/u/wotan_weevil has done an excellent job discussing the wide variety of converted carriers, but I just want to expand on the points they raised in relation to why further carrier conversion would not have been beneficial to the Japanese in the Pacific War, as well as the limitations of what you\\'re proposing. As /u/wotan_weevil has pointed out, the major bottleneck the IJN faced wasn\\'t necessarily the number of carriers they had available. In addition to the various conversions of civillian ships into the Hiyō and Taiyō classes of carriers, the IJN also launched several full sized fleet carriers. There was Taihō, a development of the Shōkaku class designs into a large armored carrier; the three completed carriers of the Unryū class, which were based of the design of Hiryū; and the Shinano, the converted hull of a Yamato class battleship, and the largest carrier ever built until the construction of the first US supercarriers nearly a decade later. Despite the construction of all these vessels, limitations on further development of improved aircraft, the lack of qualified pilots, and increasing fuel shortages meant that the IJN\\'s air arm, that had already been ground down through the Solomon Islands Campaign, was completely shattered at the Battle of the Philippine Sea, never to recover. Indeed, these kinds of shortages of aircraft and qualified pilots had dogged the IJN for nearly the entirety of the Pacific War. At the time of the Attack on Pearl Harbor, the IJN had barely enough of the Type 0 carrier fighter (the famous A6M \"Zeke\" or Zero) and qualified pilots of the same to fill its frontline units. The Kidō Butai had to scrape through nearly the entirety of the IJN to amass enough pilots and Type 0s to fill out their flight decks for the Pearl Harbor attack, and many of the second line Japanese carriers (smaller units like Ryūjō and Hōshō) and island garrisons were operating the older Type 96 (A5M \"Claude\") fighters. Even after the outbreak of the war, IJN air production struggled to keep up, such that--by the time of Midway--air strength on even the frontline Japanese carriers had begun to drop due to want of replacements. In fact, throughout all of 1942, the Japanese aircraft industry produced a mere 56 new carrier attack aircraft, hardly enough to replace the light losses experienced by the Japanese in their initial conquests, let alone outfit a number of new carrier air groups. Even if the Japanese could\\'ve increased their air capacity through more carriers, they simply wouldn\\'t have had the planes to put on them, even in 1941 or 1942. However, I want to delve into some of the proposals you\\'ve made, and hopefully explain why a swarm of \"small\" carriers would not be as combat effective or as cheap as you might think. Again, as /u/wotan_weevil discussed, there are several limitations on carrier design that made a smaller number of large carriers potentially more effective than a large number of small carriers. This was not a new problem, as it had been wrestled with by many of the world\\'s navy\\'s during the treaty era, when they were deciding how to allocate their available tonnage, resulting in carriers like the Japanese Ryūjō and American Ranger. However, it should be noted that even these smaller carrier designs were closer to half or a third the displacement of their larger counterparts, rather than one-fifth to one-tenth. The arguments for these carrier designs are, as you pointed out, that with a larger number of smaller hulls, the number of aircraft available would be larger and be better dispersed across the fleet. However, interwar experimentation with these smaller designs showed a number of issues, that resulted in a switch to larger designs. First, the smaller size meant that--especially as aircraft steadily increased in size--meant that they could operate a smaller air group. As mass was a major element in the success of an air attack (i.e. one large attack group would likely inflict more damage than a number of smaller attack groups), these limitations in size meant that a smaller carrier was likely to be less effective than a larger one. While the Japanese were early experts in coordinating aerial operations off of multiple flight decks, the limitations of much smaller air groups would\\'ve made the launching of a large coordinated strike more difficult. Secondly, and related to the former, these smaller carriers often had difficulty operating newer and larger carrier aircraft. Even at the outbreak of the war, the Ryūjō\\'s elevators were too small to operate the Type 99 carrier bomber (D3A \"Val\"), thus immediately limiting the effectiveness of its air group. While the limitations on aircraft availability for the IJN may have rendered this particular issue moot, the additional constraint on having the limit the size of aircraft in order to remain operational on smaller carriers would not have been of a great benefit to the IJN. However, beyond the operational capability and aircraft/pilot availability issues that would have plagued a proposed swarm of lighter Japanese carriers, there were also production issues. Quite simply, by the time of the Pacific War, Japan\\'s shipyard capacity was effectively maxed out already. IJN orders for new warships had filled both its own shipyards, while also cutting quite deeply into the capacity of the civilian yards, to the extent that necessary merchant shipping could simply not be constructed. Furthermore, the nature of Japan\\'s geography limited the areas available suitable for the establishment of shipyards, and those area which were suitable usually already had shipyards, and also tended to be the middle of dense urban areas, making further expansion of extant shipyards difficult as well. This is not to mention that there were issues in keeping the skilled shipyard workers available to produce new ships, as well as the availability of raw resources necessary to either expand available production, or to build new ships. Thus, even if the Japanese wanted to start turning out micro-carriers, the room or capacity for such production was simply unavailable. Hope this has helped to answer your question. Feel free to ask any follow ups.',\n",
       " \"GREEK POTTERY PART I The Ancient Greeks did not make vases in the modern sense of 'a jar for displaying flowers'. They did use vase-shaped vessels, but for storing perfume or oil (they called this type of vase a lekythos Other types of Greek pottery were for transporting wine (amphora or for mixing it (krater or for drinking it (kylix phiale Pottery was an important part of Greek daily life. It is an even more important part of classical archaeology: more pottery has survived from the ancient world than anything else. Greek pottery was made of clay. First, a potter formed the clay into the desired shape, using a wheel. Then, if the pottery was to be decorated, a pottery artist carved the outline of the design and painted the clay with a slurry of water and clay called 'slip'. Finally the clay was 'fired' in a kiln. The temperature of the kiln was controlled in a way that made the painted area go black, while the rest of the clay's surface turned red. Greek pottery was decorated in different ways during different periods. Minoan and Mycenaean periods (3000 BCE – 1200 BCE) The two great civilisations of Bronze Age Greece were the Minoans, from the island of Crete, and the Mycenaeans, from the Peloponnesian peninsula and surrounds. Their pottery often depicted animals, like cows or famously octopuses Minoan pottery often displayed geometric patterns, or marine creatures. Mycenaean pottery sometimes depicted human figures, especially in processions or on chariots The Greek 'Dark Ages' (1000 BCE – 700 BCE) After the collapse of its Bronze Age civilisations, Greece entered a 'Dark Age' (how dark this age was is heavily debated). During this period, pottery tended to display 'geometric' designs: dominated by repeating shapes and patterns. Earlier in this period, most pottery is described as 'proto-geometric': nearly all decorations are abstract shapes In the high geometric period, animals and humans return but in stylised, pattern-like form. Amphorai like this one are thought to depict funerary processions. Often, in such scenes, one figure (sometimes the corpse) will be bigger than the others: their inflated size is almost certainly a mark of high status. Asiatic Period (700 BCE – 600 BCE) As international trade grew, there was a heavy Asian influence on Greek art, as the Greeks came into contact with other peoples, especially the Phoenecians. The Sumerians and Babylonians, by then already ancient, had developed a complex mythology and iconographical system. This iconography brought lions griffins, sphinxes and other mystical creatures into Greek art. Note the lion was already extinct in Greece by this time. Archaic Period: Black-Figure (600 BCE – 480 BCE) Black- and red-figure pottery are the Platonic ideal of Greek clay-ware: when you think of a Greek vase, it is these two styles that come to mind. The difference is simple: in black-figure, the figures were coloured black. In red-figure, they were red. Black-figure technique came first, probably invented by the Corinthians and then disseminated around Greece. Once the pottery painter had carved in the scene, he painted in the outline of the figures with slip. When the jar was fired, the figures turned black. The innovation of black-figure was its depiction of lifelike human forms. Mythological scenes are common. This amphora depicts two Trojan war heroes, Achilles and Ajax, playing dice; it is one of the most famous examples of Greek pottery. It is also with black-figure that pottery-painters begin signing their work: the amphora of Achilles and Ajax, for instance, is signed by the Athenian Exekias. The Trojan war was perennially popular. Other recurring mythological figures were Herakles (the Roman Hercules) and Dionysos the god of revelry — and the patron of the symposium, the male-only debauches where pottery vessels were heavily used. Apart from mythology, wedding scenes were popular, especially wedding processions. A veiled female seated on a cart is almost always a bride. Other scenes of mortal life include women weaving or displays of athleticism (some vases were given as trophies in athletic contests). Nude men indicate that a scene is sports-related. Sometimes, black-figure wares label the characters they depict. But often they do not. Sometimes, there will be writing above a figure, but it will merely declare the figure is 'beautiful'. In mythological scenes, there are ways to tell who is who, iconographically: - Gods are often bigger than mortals; - Herakles often wears a lion-skin; - Apollo, god of music, has a lyre or kithara; - Hermes, the messenger-god, has winged sandals; - Poseidon, sea-god, has a trident; - Zeus has a long beard and sometimes a thunderbolt or a bird-messenger; - Athena, the warrior-goddess of wisdom, is the only woman to regularly dress in armour; - Dionysus is often surrounded by stunted and ugly humanoid creatures called satyrs. Another point to note is that women are also often painted in white (coloured paint was applied after firing). For example, in this amphora Achilles (black) slays the queen of the Amazons, Penthesilea (white). Note that different sides of a vase are often decorated with different scenes. Sometimes, more geometric forms are found, like the stylised eyes that often appear on kylikes or drinking cups. The captivating power of 'the eye' was, it seems, associated with Dionysus, whose dangerous energy led inebriated symposiasts into transgression.\",\n",
       " \"GREEK POTTERY PART II Classical Period: Red-Figure (500 BCE – 200 BCE) Red-figure was invented at Athens during the height of that city's powers: in the 5th century, it was the premier seafaring city-state in the Greek world and the pinnacle of cultural achievement (Socrates, Plato, the tragedians and Aristophanes etc). Red-figure quickly spread across the mediterranean: the Etruscans of central Italy (modern Tuscany) imported vast quantities of the stuff from Athens, Corinth and the Greek colonies in Sicily. Red-figure is the opposite of black-figure: the pottery painter carves the figures and then paints the background with slip. After firing, the background turns black, but the figures stay red. The new technique was a triumph in expressiveness. Because the figures were now painted a lighter shade, the artist could draw their faces in greater detail. In black-figure, figures had only been depicted in profile. Now, they could be shown front-on (lyre-player on right). Note the practice of painting women white ceased. Similar subject matter was popular as in black-figure. Trojan war scenes: for instance, the exceptionally famous kylix of Achilles binding the wounds of his co-combatant, best friend and possibly lover Patroclus. Other mythology: Oedipus and the sphinx Poseidon creating a fresh water spring for Athens; Orpheus the ur-poet about to be murdered by Thracian women. Non-mythological: scenes from comedic plays (also here and here — note the grotesquely misshapen bodies of the actors, who all wore a kind of fat suit avant la lettre); women playing music; sport The iconography of red-figure is very similar to that of black-figure. Classical Period: White Ground (500 BCE – 200 BCE) Around the time red-figure technique emerged, the Athenians also began making white pottery. They did this by using a lighter-coloured clay slip: when fired, the painted area turned white rather than black. White ground pottery was less popular and seems to have been produced exclusively in Athens. Often, white ground ware was used in weddings and funerals. The famous kylix of Apollo is painted in this style. The kithara in the seated figure's hand give him away as Apollo, god of music. Into the Hellenistic period and beyond Athens declined as a centre for pottery production some time after its conquest by Philip II of Macedon. Fine wares were still produced across the Greek world, however. But the human form was rarely again depicted on pottery with the level of detail seen in the 6th to 3rd centuries. To modern eyes, the decorations of Greek pottery are fascinating. The ancients seem to have been less enthralled: pottery-painting is not mentioned anywhere in surviving classical literature. Other visual art forms, like sculpture and wall-painting, were prized (very little Greek painting survives). We also must remember that most Greek pottery was not decorated. A family of limited means might have owned one set of expensive painted pottery, just as a modern household might have a set of silver cutlery for 'special occasions'.

       " \"The polls I have seen for postwar Japan indicate that they blamed _the military_ for World War II and its disastrous consequences in general, of which the atomic bombings were only one component. I have not seen any that make it seem like a large number blamed _the Emperor_, and even in the case of the military I have not seen anything that made it seem like people were seeking _retribution_ so much as an understanding that one should not let the military run one's country (which they did not need to enact, since the US Occupation undid that). There was, during the years of US Occupation, very little public discussion of the atomic bombings, because the US suppressed such speech in an effort to turn the Japanese into pro-US allies, and so that might have had something to do with it. In the 1950s, after the Occupation ended and there started to be conversations about these things publicly, the Japanese attitudes towards nuclear weapons were either directed towards an antipathy to war itself, or towards the United States. On Hirohito himself, a great effort was made on his behalf in the postwar to make it appear that he had nothing to do with the war and was opposed to it from the beginning. It's not as clear-cut as that in real life, but both Hirohito and his supporters, and later the US Occupation, saw value in making this kind of argument as a way to preserve Hirohito's status among the Japanese and his utility to the occupying powers. Dower's _Embracing Defeat_ touches on all of this, for further reading.\",\n",

Therefore, presumably, outside of a few peculiar occurrences, where one can imagine the accuser feeling shame for some other reasons, they did not feel shame, on the grounds that the accused was not innocent to them. Although I am much more familiar with a broadly Continental setting, and to a degree British, I can still offer a few words. Times when the water trial, or \"swim a witch\" was used, is greatly exaggerated in popular discourse. In Europe, this kind of practice was officially forbidden in some states, though the lack of oversight and centralization made this prohibition notably ineffective, so the cases in manorial and city courts still sometimes used it. But not at all at the scales sometimes imagined, but to say anything more substantial here, we need to be specific about time and place. In America, this went even further. Prior to Salem trials ( perhaps /u/dhowlett1692 can add specifically to Salem trials ), roughly from mid-seventeenth century, among 90 recorded cases ( there probably were more ), amongst the known verdicts, only in two cases was the trial by water used, and in both cases, the accused escaped the colony. ^ In America, we get two influential treaties on the subject, William Perkins\\'s Discourse on the Damned Art of Witchcraft and Richard Bernard\\'s Guide to Grand-Jury Me, published respectfully in 1608 and 1627, both of which denounced such practices, deeming them unbiblical and unscientific, and went even further in calling them a \"popish error\". Even if the event took place, like two examples from Connecticut, Elizabeth Clawson and Mercy Disborough, both of the accused requested the test by water, and both did not sink, but the court that presided the trial would not take the ordeal seriously. The jury was unable to reach a verdict, so the case went to the General court. After the opinion of ministers was drafted, one point of it read \" with the generality of divines that the Endeavour of conviction of witchcraft by Swimming was unLawfull and Sinfull. \" The ministers likewise did not pass a verdict, but heavily questioned all evidence obtained. Though the jury afterwards did in fact, even with the opinion of ministers at hand, sentenced Disborough to death, but a petition to General courts after this development got a response that the second half of the trial to be illegal, and was thus shorty after acquitted.^ 1 Drake, F. .

In other words, one can say that the extant information in medieval Icelandic parchments is only an 'unofficial/ not so proper representation' tip of the very large iceberg of '(Old) Norse culture' that we have little access to any more, and is very difficult to reconstruct solely based on a small piece of the extant evidence.

       " \"In 1942, when the Manhattan Project began, there were many unknowns. They were not totally sure they could produce _either_ form of material — both required technologies that frankly had never been developed at the industrial scale — and they didn't completely know whether either could be easily used in a workable bomb design. So they hedged their bets and developed two entirely different routes to a bomb, with the hope that one would pan out. As it turned out, one of the materials — plutonium — couldn't be used in their original, simple bomb design. Reactor bred plutonium has impurities in it that would cause it to pre-detonate if used in a design like the Hiroshima bomb. So they then had to develop an entirely different kind of bomb design (the implosion design) to use the plutonium. In the end, they had a system that could produce about 30 kg of highly-enriched uranium per month, and about 21 kg of plutonium per month. They also had two bomb designs, one that required about 60 kg of highly-enriched uranium as fuel, and another that required 6 kg of plutonium as fuel. And they had other designs in mind, but that is what they had by July 1945. So in the end they bet on two methods, and they both worked, though not quite as easily as they thought. Even then, they only had one of each type ready for use in early August 1945, just as a quirk of the schedule (and because they felt the need to test the implosion bomb before use).\",\n",
       " 'There\\'s an adage in education that is basically, \"we measure what matters.\" Which is to say, we can get a sense of what a community or society values based on the knowledge, skills, or dispositions that are assessed in schools. (There\\'s often a disconnect between the things adults claim to value and the things we ask children to learn but that\\'s a different conversation for a different subreddit.) So, given that rule of thumb and an understanding of American education history, I feel comfortable saying that yes, \"dinner with the boss\" was a thing that actually happened - or teachers thought might happen - and the main reason is that the New York State Regents Examinations in Comprehensive Vocational Homemaking routinely asked the young women taking the exam about entertaining, including for their husband\\'s boss. First, some quick context setting. NYS has the oldest formal system of education in the United States, dating back to the 1780s. This headstart meant NY policymakers and educators were experimenting with different structures long before some other states were even considering the possibility of public education. After a few different approaches to funding and curriculum, the structure that NYS fell into, and stuck with to the present day, was based on the idea that in order to ensure consistency across the state, there needed to a common measure of student learning. This measure, which was first given in the mid-1800s is colloquially known as The Regents Exams. I won\\'t subject you to a history of the exams (as fascinating as I think it is) but basically, they\\'re a series of exams given to high school students across the state as a way to document their mastery of content the state deems necessary before they\\'ll award a high school diploma with a Regents endorsement. For the purpose of your question, the most important feature was the feedback loop between NYS teachers and the exams. (At one point in the early 1900s, there were upwards of 90 different Regents exams. Schools/students could pick and choose which ones to take.) Teachers across the state determined the content for the exams and then went back to their classrooms and taught students the content that would appear on the exams. Teachers who did not participate in the writing process were given guides on what would appear (AKA standards.) They didn\\'t know the exact questions on the exams but, for example, the teachers who taught bookkeeping knew there would be several questions where students had to solve long arithmetic problems by hand and show their work. So they taught their students how to solve complicated arithmetic problems by hand and show their work. Etc. This doesn\\'t mean Homemaking was offered at every NYS high school or that all girls had to take the course, but rather, there were NYS HS teachers who wanted to offer the course and felt their course content was worthy of inclusion in the pool of knowledge students learned as part of obtaining a diploma. At some point in the early 1930s, a group of NYS educators proposed courses and a corresponding exam called Comprehensive Vocational Homemaking. Their rationale and the exact year is several hundred miles away from me in the state\\'s archive, but I know from other research that the time between proposal and exam administration was typically 1-3 years. Students then needed 3 years of courses to sit for the exam (hence \"Comprehensive.\") It\\'s my understanding that the first administration was in June 1937 and included the note: The minimum time requirement for taking this exam is 10 periods a week for three school years with outside preparation and home project work. These three years of work must include homemaking B and D. The exam was broken into multiple parts and the first question on Part I, section III of the 1937 exam question read: Suppose that you intend to invite five friends for supper, and the evening on Sunday, July 7. a. Write your part of a telephone conversation inviting one of these friends. 3 points . b You have decided to serve a buffet supper. Write the menu for it. 5 points c State your plan for the entertainment of the guests. 2 points So we know that from the beginning, Homemaking teachers thought teaching young women how to entertain was important. However, the exams weren\\'t just about entertaining - there were questions about taxes (T/F: Assessments for taxation purposes are divided equally among all the houses in a locality.) child safety (T/F: Instinct teaches a mother how to care for her baby. False. FYI.), food safety (The growth of bacteria, yeasts, and molds cause the ___ of food.), etc. I don\\'t have access to any of the exams from the 1940s but questions about entertaining appear on the 1950 exam: Part II, Question 1: Part of a home experience might be assuming responsibility for preparing dinner for a family of four and two guests. A girl might choose the following menu: tomato juice broiled steak mashed potatoes buttered peas molded fruit salad baking-powder biscuits butter chocolate cake coffee milk A. Consider all duties involved in preparing this meal. List four duties which might be done the night before, showing good management of time. While I cannot confidently speak to what happened in other states (there\\'s a book coming out in May on the topic that I\\'m very much looking forward to) but it\\'s safe to say that the heteronormative idea that a husband would go off in the morning to an office job (more on the history of \"9-5\" if you\\'re so inclined while the wife stayed home as a homemaker and at some point, \"dinner with the boss\" would happen. Which is to say: if the calendar in the kitchen is to be believed, Mr. Hart, Vision\\'s boss was coming for dinner on Wednesday, August 23, 1950, 1961, or 1967. I can\\'t say it\\'s common - hopefully, someone familiar with the history of workplace etiquette from the era will chime in - and I\\'m not sure when Wanda would have graduated high school or if she went to school in NYS but odds are good that if she attended a suburban white high school and was interested in obtaining a Regents diploma, she likely took a high school course that prepared her to expect the homemaking responsibility of hosting her husband\\'s boss (or conversely be the boss\\' wife.) She would have been taught the content needed to answer questions like (all from Homemaker exams between 1950 and 1961): A homemaker on a limited budget, with only one hour to prepare dinner ... could include in the menu rib roast of beef stuffed onions angel food cake gingerbread with applesauce ~~ Which indicates formal balance in a living room? candlesticks placed at one end of a mantle and a clock near the center similar chairs placed on either side of a window a grouping of a desk, a chair and a wastebasket a grouping of a reading lamp, a few books and a bowl of flowers on an end table ~~ A girl\\'s appearance is affected by her ability to choose clothes wisely and to keep them attractive.

The family must first decide whether to live in the large city where the father will be working or in one of the small surrounding communities. Suggest four questions the family will need to consider in making this choice. 4 ~~ The following is a dinner menu for a married couple entertaining the husband\\'s supervisor. Dinner is to be served at 6 PM. Roast beef, mashed potatoes, fresh spinach, bread, gravy, (canned) buttered beets, butter, chocolate cornstarch pudding, coffee, or milk.

Night before - make chocolate pudding and place in serving dishes. 2 PM: Wash and peel potatoes and place in cold water. 3:15: Place 5 lb. roast in oven at 325 °. 3:30: Wash spinach and place in cool water 3:40: Set table and fill water glasses 5:00: Put potatoes, spinach, and beets on stove to cook 5:30: Drain and mash potatoes and place on top of a double boiler 5:45: Measure coffee into pot and set water on to boil 5:50: Get serving dishes from cupboard. 5:55: Place meat and vegetables on serving dishes. Make a seating chart and diagram of one place setting for this dinner. (Postscript: It\\'s fairly easy for us in 2021 to read such questions and pass judgment on the teachers who wrote the exams and the young women who took the courses. However, it\\'s worth stressing again that the exams also included questions about negotiating a lease, first aid, disaster management, pursuing professional goals, and pulling together a sharp outfit. Also, question 48 on the 1957 exam read: The ideal family pattern toward which most young couples strive today is autocratic matriarchal patriarchal democratic. The correct answer was 4.)',\n",
       " 'This isn\\'t just a common scenario in sitcoms, but \"dinner with the boss\" pops up a lot in personal essays written by women in the 1950\\'s. Humorists Erma Bombeck and Teresa Bloomingdale, as well as humorist/playwright Jean Kerr all have several essays about entertaining their husband\\'s boss at dinner at their home, or about having a dinner party at their bosses home (Jean Kerr writes about attending a dinner party at her husband\\'s boss\\'s home, only to discover her dress is made of the same material as the drapes). There are other examples I\\'ve come across, but those women\\'s essays stick out the most to me, as they all wrote about mishaps, and had livelier writing than domestic personal essays from magazines of the period. Cookbooks of the period occasionally throw in a comment about \"impressing a boss\" with their \"Special Occasion\" recipes. There are also special sections about entertaining bosses in etiquette and domestic guides of the period, going into the 70\\'s. Emily Post and Miss Manners both give advice as to not being a boor at such a dinner party and polite topics of conversation. There seems to be less \"My promotion hinges on my wife impressing the boss\" than there is in sitcoms - but it is also the nature of a sitcom plot to exaggerate the stakes for extra humor. However, based on writing at the time, it was common that an employer would visit a private home and spend an evening with the family of a prospective promotee. The inclusion in domestic writing, humor primarily written for women (most of these essays that were later gathered into books were first published in women\\'s magazines), and in books intended to help women in preparation all make mention of it as established fact, rather than as an extraordinary circumstance. Actually, going back, there are mentions of husbands bringing their bosses home for dinner in books well before the 1950\\'s, or bosses inviting employees over for dinner to discuss their careers. Maud Hart Lovelace, who was writing in the 1950\\'s about the 1910\\'s, wrote a dinner party her boss threw to discuss her career, where she met her husband (she had replaced him for the duration).',\n",
       " 'They did indeed! The god Ra and ra (\"sun\") are written slightly differently, however, thanks to the Egyptian system of determinatives. Determinatives are unvocalized hieroglyphs written at the end of a word to disambiguate that word. For example, action verbs often have the striking arm determinative, and male and female names are accompanied the seated man and woman determinative, respectively. Determinatives/classifiers are extremely important because the Egyptian hieroglyphic system – unlike Anatolian or Maya hieroglyphic writing – does not record vowels, so unrelated words can appear very similar.

       " \"Also, I hope this isn't a repeat question. I did my best to look through previous posts. Unfortunately, it is. It's also the question we have to thank for getting me into actual historical study, as someone in this subreddit has enabled. Here's my usual copypaste on the matter, recently updated. I'm afraid your question rests on a false premise. Medieval water cleanliness was Serious Business, and the notion that they all drank alcoholic drinks to make water safe is pop-cultural nonsense. I shall direct you first to the VFAQ (Middle Ages, subsection Health and Hygiene, in case your browser doesn't go there immediately), in particular the answers from u/sunagainstgold and u/Qweniden. To illustrate just how Serious Business water was for the Medieval era, more u/sunagainstgold on the incidents she touches on in her VFAQ post: On the father advising his sons to drink the well-water boiled On the town of Siena that flayed alive someone convicted of well-poisoning And several more illustrative accounts of the Medieval attitude towards water safety Of course, none of this is to say that the people of the Medieval period avoided alcohol. Quite the opposite; booze in its multifarious forms is a definite fixture in the Medieval liquid diet. No; Medieval people drank alcohol because water is boring. (In fact, this remains true today, and with drinks beyond just booze. Look me in the eye and tell me seriously that, in the past three days, you have drank only water and no other beverage at all. No tea, no coffee, no booze, no soda, no sports drink, only water. If you can honestly say that, then I commend you for being a most rare individual. And if you'd ask me, I'd say the whole paragraph above applies to all people of all places and times - but I hang around with the Medievalists and not the other eras, so Medieval it is. But I will still defend that water is boring and people find ways around that.) u/sunagainstgold has in the FAQ and the first linked answer called water 'the beggar's drink', and it's exactly that societal attitude that drives the nominal Medieval disdain for drinking water. The Medievals did drink water - but if they could at all help it, not straight water. Do that, and you're a poor person who can't Do Things to your water to elevate it. When we see elites drinking water, they've all Done Things to it. Liutprand of Cremona admired the water drank by the Byzantine emperor Constantine VII, for it had been boiled, then frozen. Other elites improved their water by Adding Things, such as ice, wine, parsley seed, vinegar, honey, fruit, and so on. Which takes us to alcohol and the Medievals. Remember, the water is safe, or safe enough - but it's still common, so it has to be elevated to make it fit for consumption by people of worth. Alcohol has to be made, not just collected. Someone has to put effort into turning the ingredients into a drinkable product, and then the drinker then has to shell out money to purchase said drinkable product. When you need to display your status and your wealth, it's easy to see where alcohol meets that need. But if you're asking me, it's because water is boring and people anytime anywhere will do anything they can to drink anything but water. Even if they have to admit that they'll have to drink water sooner or later.\",\n",
       " \"While there is always more to be explored and I'm willing to reply further discussion, I wrote and posted this tentative answer last year in the relevant question thread, Did the Vikings that settled Iceland also kept the tradition of raiding? The points of the answer are: Already diversified Old Norse ships: Icelanders did not generally bring warship (longship) to settle in the new settlement, so while their ships were suitable for crossing the ocean as a cargo (knörr) with a relatively large loading capacity, they were not so optimized for raiding. Icelandic chieftains had relatively little incentive to retain military retinue in their new home compared with their possible counterpart in Scandinavian mainland. These two points means that the majority of Icelandic chieftains in the 10th century and later must have difficulty in organizing capable viking raids out of Iceland by their own initiatives. On the other hand, it was still entirely possible for eager young Icelanders to take a journey out of Iceland and joined in the retinue of Scandinavian ruler who were going to 'go Viking', as narrated in some of 'sagas of Icelanders (family sagas)'. I can also add to the critical information on the demography of medieval Iceland: While the actual estimation by researchers vary (the maximum of ca. 80,000), the most trustworthy medieval account (the Book of the Icelanders) say that there were only 3,840 house-holder with more than a certain amount of property (thus who can pay the tax) in whole Iceland in 1096 (Grønlie trans. 2006: 12). The mean value of the estimated total population was ca. 40,000, I suppose. Compared with the estimated demography of medieval Nordic kingdoms, as I alluded in Did the Nordic countries use to have a comparatively larger population back at the time of the vikings? If not how were they so often able to raid Britain? (ca. 200,000 for Viking Age Norway and a bit more for Sweden, and perhaps ca. 800,000 for Denmark), this estimated figure is too small, only about the quarter of that of Norway (Remember that pre-modern demography is almost always based on some hypothetical calculation formula, so there can be an quite amount of possible errors). In short, I'm very confidant to say negative to OP's question that there must have been much fewer Vikings in Viking Age Iceland than in Norway, Sweden or Denmark. Add.

       " 'Hey! Well, to answer your question the most directly and generically: into a mass grave, alongside their body. However this of course depended on who you were, and where you were. I\\'d also like to challenge that \"17,000\" number. I see that on Wikipedia, without a source; that number seem high if we\\'re JUST talking about guillontining deaths from 1793-1794 (the timeframe from the Wikipedia article), but low if we\\'re talking total deaths for that year. Any death statistics for the French Revolution always come down to the details. For example: Over 100,000 people died in the Vendée in 1793; should we include them in the death counts? What about those executed during the Terror, but not by guillotine? The numbers can vary widely depending upon which subset you\\'re looking at (and usually the Vendée deaths are kept separate), so keep that in mind. Back to the question of where these victims made their final resting place: most non-unique victims of the guillotine were dumped into mass graves. Guillotine victims in larger cities were usually dispatched in batches every day, so say 30 victims would be executed, taken to a mass grave, and uncerimoniously dumped in-- the revolutionaries weren\\'t concerned with proper funery rites. Something to keep in mind though was that many victims of the Terror were not guillotined: there were many special cases where other methods were employed. Often this comes down to morbid efficiency; during the \"Great Terror\" (late 1793- July 1794), as the \"Representitives on Mission\" (National Convention members given full powers and sent out into the departments to enact a governmental presence) attempted to quell various counter-revolution activity and uprisings, there often was neither the time nor inclination to use the guillotine, a rather slow method of executing large groups of prisoners. To highlight a few infamous examples, there was Collot d\\'Buois, a sans-culotte Committee member who had a large group of political prisoners in Lyons shot with a canon before a mass grave. The most infamous example is John Baptiste Carrier, who tied his unlucky constituents of Nantes together, put them on sinkable barges, and drown them in the Loire river. This is to say nothing of the rebellion ongoing in the Vendée, where republican troops were massacring citizens with military weaponry. I will point out here for anyone interested that this uneven application of the Terror-- and the gruesome methods carried out by men like Collot and Carrier-- was unacceptable to Robespierre, who wished for an even application of what he considered revolutionary justice. He believed that these men damaged the revolution by their excesses, in an equal yet opposite way from those whose leniency let go many committed counter revolutionaries. His attempt to recall and try men like Collot and Carrier (and their permissive counterparts such as Taillen) was a huge impetus for the Thermidorian reaction that brought him down-- lead as it was by the men mentioned above. Aside from your geographic location, what happened to your corpse depended on who you were. The main instance of this was the former head and body of Louis XVI, who after being executed had his body covered with corrosive materials so that it would dissolve, leaving nothing behind for any sympathetic grave-diggers. Let me know if you have any more questions!',\n",
       " 'I do not wish to rain on anyone\\'s parade. But. There are a few issues with the article\\'s summary that might help provide a better context for your inquiry. As noted, Italy introduced a rather strict antisemitic legislation in 1938, limiting the opportunities for employment, education, marriages, residence of the Italian Jews, in such a way as to de facto remove the \"Jewish presence\" from the Italian life. These laws were already extremely afflictive at the time of their introduction and were - despite the widespread narrative of overwhelming opposition by the Italian population and (even) authorities - actually enforced by the Regime quite seriously (as noted already by De Felice in his Storia degli Ebrei Italiani sotto il fascismo, 1961 - the first systematic attempt at a general history on the topic). It is important, in order to assess the degree of commitment of a Regime to a certain policy and its reception, to compare it to how effectively and strictly other policies were enforced (in this sense, the antisemitic legislation worked comparatively better than many other pieces of demographic or social legislation). This doesn\\'t certainly mean that there weren\\'t Italians (both Jews and non Jews) who resisted it, or - more frequently - sought ways to circumvent it and shield their friends and relatives, or even complete strangers, from suffering the worst consequences of it. Different reconstructions of the genesis of the antisemitic legislation exist (from G. Favre and M. Sarfatti, who lean towards an intentionalist interpretation of Mussolini\\'s antisemitic choice; to those who, albeit with varying weight, ascribe a role to both the connection with traditional approaches to the \"Jewish question\" in the Catholic world and Italian culture, and the \"segregationist\" legislation passed in 1935-36 to address the relations with the subjects of Italy\\'s new African \"Empire\", and to the influence of the German model - like M. Michaelis, G. Israel, G. Miccoli). I regard the connection between the racist legislation introduced within the colonies and the subsequent antisemitic laws to be a persuasive one, even if there is no doubt that the progressive aligment with Germany influenced the forms and modes of extension of certain regulations to the mainland (for a recent examination of this point, see Matard-Bonucci). That said, it is necessary to keep in mind that ideological influences - which nonetheless seemed to attract for the most part those \"newer generations\" who sought more radical and genuine modes of fascist existence in the National-Socialist model - and matters of convenience do no represent a constriction. Italy didn\\'t have to pass antisemitic legislation in 1938. The alliance with Germany made it more sensible from the perspective of the Regime, and the necessity to find an answer to what was perceived as a failure - or at least a lagging behind - in the project to \"remake the Italians\", encouraged the recourse to more \"radical\" social policies. But - unlike many Jews in the years to follow - the Italian Fascist Regime didn\\'t exist, in 1938, on the verge of physical elimination. There were other options - more costly, and inconvenient ones perhaps - but options the Regime deemed not worthy of being pursued. At that time - and until Italy\\'s national sovreignty, and credibility with the Axis ally was completely shattered in 1943 - it would be improper to claim that Mussolini was \"protecting the jews from Hitler\". The Italian antisemitic laws afflicted Italian citizens (sort of, according to the Italian legislation of the time), and delivering them to a foreign power would have represented a serious blow for a Regime which should have been able to handle the \"Jewish question\" by its own means. Additionally, the estimated number of Italian Jews rounded up to about 50,000 in 1938; a fairly modest number compared to the much more sizable communities still harbored in Hungary or, previously, in Poland and in the Baltic States, so that (even from the perspective of the Nazi Government) the opportunity of their elimination probably didn\\'t warrant the risk of worsening their relations with Italy. Furthermore, it is true that - until 1943 - the perspective of physical elimination of the Italian Jews had remained confined to the minds of few, selected, rabidly antisemitic figures within the Fascist ranks. Mussolini himself - who knew about the German conduct in the occupied territories and was (broadly) aware of their policies of extermination - doesn\\'t appear to have conceived of such fate for the Italian Jews, nor to harbor any fundamental hatred towards them, aside from the adoption of certain rather common tropes of literary antisemitism. It\\'s only in September 1943, when Mussolini is rescued from his imprisonment and installed as head of the puppet Repubblica Sociale Italiana, that the issue of the Italian Jews - and their deportation and extermination - returns prominently on the table. And it is at that moment that the Germans - who certainly had a habit of finding faults in the Italian conduct of the war, and in connecting every fault to the obscure influence of the Jews - could begin to exert a significant degree of pressure on the Italian authorities to deliver the Italian Jews for extermination. This emboldened the Italian supporters of a radical solution to the \"Jewish question\". Giovanni Preziosi - former publicist and personality of some significance within the Regime - actually took matters into his own hands. Dissatisfied with the \"program of Verona\" which only branded Jews \"foreigners\" belonging to \"an enemy nation\" and for the expansion of antisemitic laws allowing for the seizure of their properties and deportation into selected areas, and with Mussolini\\'s apparent attempts to stall or delay the execution of (what, at the time, had actually become) the German demands, wrote directly to Mussolini complaining about the inadequacy of the measures adopted to that point, blaming the Italian betrayal on the Jewish influence, and advocating for the removal of every Jew, \"jewish woman or mongrel\" from Italy as the only mean to achieve the unity necessary to win the war. Preziosi had made it so that the letter reached Mussolini through a channel that the Germans had easy access to, de facto ensuring that the same letter would make its way up to the German commands. It was then Preziosi himself who - in March 1944 - was placed at the head of the Italian \"Ispectorate for Demography and Race\", tasked with ensuring that the Italian Jewish residents were properly located and accounted for. Preziosi\\'s initiatives were, indeed, hampered by the reluctance of the Italian authorities to comply with his fanatic zeal and by the progressive collapse of the political and social structures within the German occupied portion of Northern Italy - the RSI government itself rejected Preziosi\\'s proposal for a full revision of the \"lists of Jewishness\" compiled in 1938. As a last note, given that the article makes a point of quoting a Holocaust survivor offering her testimony, and that I see the topic appear quite often; one should be careful to put some nuance in addressing the matter of Jewish children being taught Christian rituals in order to blend in. Signore, signora, tomorrow is the Feast of St. Anthony, and on this feast you tie your kerchief this way, and give a donation there, hold your rosary like this … It was very, very important to blend in. By all means, the person interviewed is the best judge of her own experience, and full credit to the people who sheltered and protected her. But the author of the piece should be aware of the significant role played by the idea of \"redemption\" of the Jews among those catholic groups which - without supporting any policy of extermination - saw the introduction of (traditional) forms of antisemitic discrimination as an opportunity to test the new centrality of Catholicism within the Italian state. The idea of cultural elements and forms of devotion being strong enough to overcome any supposed \"biological\" fault of the \"Jewish blood\" is also regarded as a trait-d\\'union between the Fascist approach to mixed-blood situations and the Church\\'s approach to mixed-marriages situations. No doubt there were many clergymen and women who placed the protection of human lives ahead of personal and religious concerns, and many devout Catholics who did the same - nor did this interpretation mirror the official position of the Church - but it\\'s a matter that should be handled with more care, especially when the article appears already to paint too rosy a picture of the condition of the Jews in Italy during 1938-45.',\n",
       " \"You just might be the poet Ovid, once the literary sensation of the city, who in AD 8 was banished from Rome and exiled to Tomis, on the Black Sea. We don't know exactly what he did - he blamed carmen et error ('a poem and a mistake') - but we do know that it happened without a trial and by the direct order of the emperor Augustus. Ovid wrote a lengthy poem - the Tristia, or 'Sad Things' - about his fate, and towards the end of it gives a vivid description of the miseries of being abruptly separated from Rome and, most importantly, its culture: If anyone there still remembers exiled Ovid, if my name’s alive in the city now I’m gone, let him know that, beneath the stars that never touch the sea, I live among the barbarian races. The Sarmatians, a wild tribe, surround me, the Bessi and the Getae, names unworthy of my wit! ... Men keep out the dreadful cold with sewn trousers and furs: the face alone appears of the whole body. Often their hair tinkles with hanging icicles, and their beards gleam white with a coat of frost. ... If I recite my verse, there’s no one about, to ensure I receive an intelligent hearing: ... I often search for a word, a name, a location, and there’s no one I can ask, to be more certain. Often in trying to say something – shameful confession! – words fail me, and I’ve forgotten how to speak. Thracian and Scythian tongues sound round me, and I think I could almost write in Getic metres.^ As you might expect, Ovid wasn't exactly happy with his change of scenery. Firstly, he didn't recognise any of his new neighbours as Romans, referring to them exclusively by 'barbarian' names like 'Sarmatians' and 'Getae'. This wasn't just snobbery: to be 'Roman' didn't just mean living in the Roman empire. Exactly what it did mean depended on who you asked, but in a purely legal sense it's important to realise that citizenship was a restricted commodity in our period - until Caracalla opened it to all free men in the empire in AD 212, nearly all citizens were either Italians or had received citizenship through military service in the auxilia, which made a retiring soldier and his children Roman citizens. Later in the poem, Ovid writes about the rare occasions on which a Roman sailor would come into port and allow him some civilised conversation - he certainly didn't see himself as a countryman of the people of Tomis, though they all lived under Roman rule. It's also worth noting that Ovid draws attention to three key markers of difference between the people of Tomis and the Romans - they don't speak the same language or belong to the same literary culture (hence his tongue-in-cheek remark about 'Getic metres'), they don't dress the same (Romans never wore trousers, referring to themselves as the gens togata - 'the nation that wears the toga', and his comments about wearing 'furs' is intended to suggest that these people are close to animals), and they don't groom themselves the same - outside the army, early first-century Romans generally kept clean-shaven. In several ways, then, his point in the Tristia is that the hinterlands of the empire, for all that they are Roman territory, are completely alien to 'real' Romans like him. You might fairly point out, however, that Ovid had an obvious axe to grind - he was deeply upset at his exile and the major 'point' of the Tristia is to convince the emperor to recall him (or, at least, to build sympathy for the fact that he wouldn't). In reality, Tomis was a reasonably-sized city, which may well already have had its aqueduct and is known today for the remains of one of the largest Roman mosiacs in the world, dating to the 4th century AD. As plenty of scholars have pointed out since Ovid's day, it was originally a Greek colony and would have been home to plenty of people able to speak to him (at least in Greek) about high literature and culture. The division between 'Roman' and 'Barbarian' was not so clear-cut - as Sabine Grebe nicely put it, 'the cultured Greek world and the barbarian world coexisted in Tomis.'^ Indeed, had Ovid gone the other way and ended up near Nickenich on the Rhine, he might feasibly have met an interesting family who had quite a different idea of what identity meant on the Roman frontier. In the mid first-century AD, they were the subjects of a remarkable funerary monument depicting them in impeccably-carved Roman style, and giving their names as 'Contuinda, daughter of Esucco, and her son Silvanus Ategnissa'. 'Contuinda' is an unmistakably Celtic name, as is her father's single name, but her son's name combined a Celtic one (Ategnissa) with a Roman one to form a more Roman-style doublet. In the carving itself, Contuinda is shown wearing Roman dress over Celtic, while Silvanus Ategnissa appears in a Roman tunic.^ It's highly likely that Contuinda's son, and therefore presumably his father, had attained Roman citizenship, but she certainly didn't have it - and yet nevertheless the whole family clearly wanted to be recognised as belonging to that Roman world. Moreover, they made a pretty strong case that they could do so while still belonging to the non-Roman world of their ancestors. In his book Barbarian Migrations and the Roman West, Guy Halsall has written much more on this topic, arguing that identities (particularly in Late Antiquity) were generally seen as overlapping rather than mutually exclusive - that, whatever Ovid thought, most people on the Roman frontiers didn't see it as either-or.\",\n",
       " 'First, a quick point of clarification on terminology: The word \"Hohokam\" is a misspelling of the O\\'odham word \"Huhugkam\"/\"Huhugam\". It\\'s preferable to use the latter name to refer to the society, but archaeologists discussing the archaeological culture continue to use the term \"Hohokam\" for historical reasons. Archaeology Southwest has published an excellent explanation of these terms As for the ultimate fate of the Huhugam, it\\'s worth first saying what didn\\'t happen. Unlike what many informational websites (e.g. arizonaruins.com will breathlessly tell you, they didn\\'t disappear into the aether. Archaeologists today have a pretty good idea of what happened (relative to other societal transformations) and where they went. The first people to ask are the people you mentioned in your question, the \"later\" tribes of O\\'odham and Yuman peoples that now inhabit the Salt and Gila river basins. It was the O\\'odham who (through transliteration errors) gave us the name Hohokam, roughly (and incorrectly!) translated as \"that which has perished\" by Haury 1. Early ethnographers were confused by other information the O\\'odham relayed to them, as they insisted the Huguham were simultaneously both their ancestors and not people they identified with. That\\'s one piece of the puzzle solved then, some of the Huhugam became the O\\'odham peoples. We now know through a lot of excellent work that members of the Huhugam also migrated to other areas, especially the northern Puebloan groups like the Zuni and Hopi. Matthew Peeples is especially notable here for his analysis of the protohistoric migrations and conclusively establishing this 2. The question remains though: why did the Hohokam cease to be, and why do their descendents not fully identify with them? To answer that, we\\'ll have to get into the story of what happened. I\\'ll be drawing heavily from Galiner\\'s Short Swift Time 3 and Hill et al 3. David Abbott\\'s Centuries of Decline is also worth looking at, but you may find it drier. For an accessible narrative that\\'s a bit less academic and doesn\\'t require an academic library, the NPS has an excellent page 5. Only 4 oral histories of the end of the Hohokam survive in the literature today, all from elderly Pimans. These accounts all agree on the overall narrative: In the beginning there were the People, and their gods had shown them how to farm. The People quickly became masters of agriculture, building great canals across the land and importing vast riches from the far reaches of the earth Eventually, this vast success and wealth breeds jealousy and inequality in the people. War breaks out and in their anger, the People kill a demi-god. The demi-god is a bit peeved by this and when he\\'s reborn into the world, he goes to the nearby Wuṣkam who have not become so wealthy or greedy. They agree to help him get revenge, and march on Casa Grande fortress of a powerful witch-king. An epic battle commences and the witch-king loses, fleeing downriver to Casa Blanca, which I unfortunately can\\'t provide pictures for because its current form is a vague, nondescript hill on private land used for off-roading near the modern town of the same name. The civil war continues with mounting losses for the Huhugam against the righteous Wuṣkam, eventually culminating in the destruction of the last Hohokam great house. The Wuṣkam become the O\\'odham and here we are. Archaeologically speaking, we can\\'t substantiate the conflict parts of this (unless your name is Wilcox). They may have occurred, but on a smaller scale and some people 4 have proposed that the conflict was not between armies, but instead an uprising against elites with the help of outsiders. We do see that for whatever reason, massive political failure to manage the canal networks occurs, famine abounds, and over only a couple decades the lower salt river becomes almost entirely depopulated. The O\\'odham peoples shift from large Great Houses to more egalitarian, smaller scale farming communities. This shift was echoed all across the greater southwest within a couple centuries. It was probably a combination of internal conflict, climatic instability, and simple political issues, though we\\'re still arguing about the right balance between all of these. And finally to answer your sidenote, the closest living languages to the Huhugam language(s) are probably the Piman languages, especially O\\'odham.

       " 'There\\'s more to be said, but here\\'s an old answer of mine: &#x200B; In 1931, Guomindang (GMD) representatives met with Puyi in the Japanese concession in Tianjin. The GMD offered Puyi various housing and living benefits, as well as promising greater Manchu representation in the Republican government, as long as he did not return to Manchuria. Why was the GMD so concerned with an emperor who had lost his throne twenty years earlier and played no active part in Chinese politics since then (aside from a quixotic royalist attempt to restore dynastic rule in 1917)? Gao You-tang, the chief GMD negotiator, explained: The League of Nations is not happy with the Japanese. The Japanese have no way out. If the Japanese establish an independent nation under the name of Manchu autonomy in the Northeast, which is the home-land of the Manchus, the Japanese can manipulate the state behind the scenes. Furthermore, after WWI, in Europe many new states were established under the name of restoration of a nation. World powers could not stop them from doing so. Following the Manchurian Incident in 1931, the Japanese Kwantung Army had driven out the Fengtian warlord Zhang Xue-liang from Manchuria and established the state of Manchukuo. To Chinese and western observers, Manchukuo was merely a Japanese colony masquerading as a nation-state. Japan was therefore eager to bring Puyi into the fold, for despite his fall from power, his identity as the last Manchu emperor continued to hold prestige among ethnic Manchus and in the Manchu homeland of Manchuria. By returning Puyi to the throne, some much needed legitimacy could be given to the state of Manchukuo. Unsurprisingly, Puyi rejected the offers from the very party that had thrown him out from the Forbidden Palace in 1911, and was once again crowned emperor in the Manchukuo capital of Changchun on 9 March 1932. However, Puyi’s status as the ruler of the Manchus posed an equally big danger to Japanese hopes of exploiting the natural resources of Manchuria. To use Puyi in the early days of Manchukuo to stress its legitimacy on the basis of ethnic self-determination was one thing; to actually give Puyi practical power and declare a “Manchuria for the Manchus” was a different thing entirely. After all, any emphasis on the right of Manchus for an independent nation-state would inevitably raise questions on the Japanese presence on Manchurian soil. In light of this contradiction, rhetoric on Manchurian identity began to change by 1933. With the withdrawal of Japan from the League of Nations, international opinion could be largely ignored, and the emphasis on ethnic self-determination could be set aside. A new slogan was brought forth: “Harmony of the Five Ethnic Groups (wuzu xiehe)”. The new Manchukuo national principle of ethnic harmony was much better suited to justify Japanese involvement in Manchuria. Conceiving Manchuria as a melting pot of different ethnic groups, Japanese theorists hoped that a new national identity could be formed. No longer were Han Chinese, Manchus, Koreans, Japanese and Mongols separated by ethnic differences: they were now all Manchurians. While some Japanese thinkers did indeed idealise Manchukuo as a nation of ethnic harmony, it is clear that most Japanese politicians saw this as merely a facade. A confidential report of the Japanese Diet in 1933 highlighted the continued prominence of Japan: Imperial Japan should guide Manchoukuo in accordance with its social characteristics and with respect to its façade of independence and historical customs in order to realise ethnic harmony and peaceful contentment...However, Imperial Japan must continually act as the guiding power behind the scenes. This, of course, grated heavily against the sentiments of Puyi and his supporters. Xiqia, the Secretary of Finance and a firm Manchu royalist, questioned Japanese prominence in the Manchukuo government: Because we are in a multi-ethnic state where all ethnic groups are equal, why should the Japanese get special privileges? This was dismissed by Japanese officials (and soon after, Xiqia was dismissed as well) as mere bellyaching. Clearly, the higher salaries of Japanese officials and military personnel was justified by the Japanese blood spilled in defence of Manchukuo. In the Outline of the Directive Principles for Personnel Administration in Manchukuo, issued by the Staff Office of the Kwantung Army in 1935, Japanese superiority was defended: It is not a policy of ethnic prejudice, but a just policy that helps Japanese officials who work in Manchukuo at high risk to their safety and lives, and who spend more on daily expenditures. Such attitudes did not improve the bad mood of Puyi’s supporters. They became even more furious when Japanese advisors told Puyi not to visit the mausoleum of his imperial ancestors, as he was now the emperor of the five ethnic groups and not only of the Manchus. Many were aghast when Puyi declared that Amaterasu, the divine ancestress of the Japanese imperial line, was also his ancestor and volunteered to worship her. Without armed support, Manchu anger could amount to nothing more than petty grumblings. The diary of Pujia, Puyi’s cousin and an officer of the imperial guardsmen, had an entry on 16 July 1940 that intentionally misspelled the Chinese terms of the Japanese ambassador. Instead of the term of ambassador, dashi (大使), Pujia wrote dashi (大屎) - literally “big shit”. Petty insubordination did little to change the fact that the \"Manchu\" nature of Manchukuo had long been discarded by the Japanese. From 1933 onward, the Manchu elite were powerless to stop the erosion of their status as banner people in face of “ethnic harmony”, or the transformation of their emperor as a symbol for Manchukuo instead of the Manchus. The Japanese did indeed need Puyi and the symbolism of ethnic self-determination during the establishment of Manchukuo, but once the state was in place, this symbolism was no longer needed. Instead of “Manchuria for the Manchus,” the Northeast Provinces had become “Manchukuo for the Manchurians.” &#x200B; Sources: Shao, Dan.

Adrienne Mayor Adrienne Mayor is a classicist at Stanford University who focuses on the relationship between fossils and myth and culture. She has argued that various cultures have found fossils and incorporated them into their artistic traditions and cultures. Here are two examples. Both of the above are trace fossils formed by the behavior of dinosaurs, rather than body fossils of the dinosaurs themselves. Lesotho: Lesotho has a decent collection of dinosaur trackways, which some researchers suspect might have inspired these cave paintings. American Southwest: Adrienne Mayor has also argued that certain Southwest peoples such as the Pueblo and the Hopi use gastroliths in their pottery-making. Note - in her book The First Fossil Hunters, she also presents the argument that ceratopsians from the Gobi Desert region inspired legends of griffins (Mayor 2011). I was not convinced that the ceratopsian finds really did inspire the griffin legends and artistic motifs and thought much of the evidence was circumstantial. EDIT: To clarify, I am not sold on any of the proposed dinosaur explanations, but I think that the griffin one is the most doubtful.

       " 'I’ll note first that I am far from an expert in maritime affairs. I don’t know my capstan from my halyard, although I do know that starboard is right and port is a fortified wine. I am approaching sea shanties as a musical phenomenon, which by this point they are. Hopefully someone can chime in about what exactly all that heaving and hauling was supposed to be accomplishing; I’ll concern myself with the music. The Shanty Itself There are really multiple answers to your question, in part depending on how you define “sea shanty” and what you mean by “origins.” This sounds like academic waffle, but it is important to think about what assumptions we have coming into the discussion. \"Sea shanty\" is often taken to mean essentially any song sung on a ship, for any purpose. If you\\'re asking about the origins of songs being sung on boats, you\\'re out of luck. There is evidence of music being used to ease work on boats going back 4 millennia to Ancient Egypt, and no real reason to doubt that the phenomenon is much, much older still. But you asked about \"sea shanties,\" which I\\'ll argue are a much more narrowly defined category. They are mainly 19th century in origin, and focused around the sailing culture in the Anglosphere. These are the songs that inevitably get sung and passed around when we talk about sea shanties, not, say, the songs Polynesian voyagers sing, or whatever was going on with those Egyptian boats. These sea shanties are almost entirely English language, often call-and-response in some way, and have common themes that pop up often, like the Napoleonic Wars (\"A drop of Nelson\\'s blood wouldn\\'t do us any harm\"), women at home (\"I want to spend my money on Sally Brown\"), and the far-off destinations sailors might be heading to (\"And we\\'re bound for the Rio Grande\"). The narrowest definition of \"sea shanties\" confines the term to just the songs that were used to help sailors time their movements while working. This is very evident in some shanties, with the melody hitting a forceful note that was everyone\\'s cue to pull, ensuring that no effort was wasted. \"Haul Away, Joe!\" is a common example, with the refrain \"way, haul away, haul away Joe!\" A popular verse in \"Haul Away Joe!\" refers to King Louis XVI, saying that \"King Louis was the king of France before the revolution/until he got his head cut off, it spoiled his constitution!\" This obviously places it after the late 18th century, already giving us some clues as to its time period. This is a separate category from all the songs about sailing, the sea, and the concerns of sailors. Those are separate again from songs that sailors would have sung on board during leisure time, which may or may not have had anything to do with sailing. Nowadays, all three categories are often lumped in as “sea shanties.” This is largely due to the fact that sea shanties are now almost entirely performative, seen as part of a broader folk music tradition. They are divorced from their original context, which changes them and our attitude towards them. That’s a topic for later in the answer, though. The sea shanty as we know it (well, sort of, we’ll get to that soon) took form in the 19th century. While we do see singing on British ships before then, it is not nearly as widespread or as established as a tradition. Short tasks would have had accompanying chants, and very few of note have made it down to us. The oldest known shanty-like work song from a British ship is referenced in the Complaynt of Scotland in 1549, but sources are pretty scarce besides that. By the end of the 18th century, though, we’re starting to see some more singing on British ships. The shanty as we know it then pops up around the Americas in the early 19th century. It owes no small debt to the work songs of the African and Afro-Caribbean/African-American people who were transported on many ships as slaves, and who were then put to work making many of the goods that would sustain the shipping economy. In particular, there is a much stronger call-and-response tradition in many African musics, especially work songs, than in European music. It’s important to note that for African-descended people, singing during work was by no means confined to sea or boat work. Many sources from the time note that no matter the work, no matter the situation, they seemed to be a song that suited the occasion. Some of this may be embellishment; the happy-go-lucky singing slave is a common racist trope (something else we’ll touch on later). Regardless, it’s clear work songs were commonplace among Africans and their descendants in a way that they weren’t among Europeans. Constant exposure to these work songs helped drive development of the sea shanty, which started becoming popular on ships around the Americas and the Caribbean before proliferating elsewhere. Benefits to coordination and morale were a big reason why they proliferated. But it’s also too “just so” to point to those factors; people do just like singing, and singing a sea shanty was just as fun then as it is now. If anything more so, because, as I’ve noted in another answer here, back before recorded music people had to make their own music a lot more than we do now. Ultimately, not knowing much about British sailing culture of the 19th century, I can’t speculate too much on the exact reason why everyone started singing. Hopefully someone with more maritime experience can chime in.',\n",

Basler, Volume III, \"Address before the Wisconsin State Agricultural Society, Milwaukee, Wisconsin\" (September 30, 1859), pp. 478-479. \"No country can sustain, in idleness, more than a small percentage of its numbers. The great majority must labor at something productive.\" - The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln edited by Roy P. Basler, Volume III, \"Address before the Wisconsin State Agricultural Society, Milwaukee, Wisconsin\" (September 30, 1859), p. 479. Lincoln was a strong supporter of labor, using labor as a means of acquiring property (wealth), and utilizing wealth to employ others. He does highlight that the difference between the free labor from slavery and the wage labor of the north is the ability to acquire property by means of saving a surplus. To say that \"wage labor was often despised\" is a stretch, as Lincoln himself was a strong supporter. So much so that he had some strong words to say about ineffective labor: \"Upon this subject, the habits of our whole species fall into three great classes---useful labour, useless labour and idleness. Of these the first only is meritorious; and to it all the products of labour rightfully belong; but the two latter, while they exist, are heavy pensioners upon the first, robbing it of a large portion of it\\'s just rights. The only remedy for this is to, as far as possible, drive useless labour and idleness out of existence.\" - The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln edited by Roy P. Basler, Volume I, \"Fragments of a Tariff Discussion\" (December 1, 1847), p. 412.',\n",
       " 'I can comment on some of these questions, as I personally know quite a few people who attended international schools in the USSR (specifically Patrice Lumumba University) and I\\'m interested in this topic as well. I\\'ll try to answer your questions one by one, but will go into more depth when possible. There were no anti-miscegenation laws in the USSR, and there are quite a few notable instances of non-Soviet Black people immigrating to the USSR and marrying Soviet citizens — off the top of my head I am reminded of Wayland Rudd a Black American actor who married Lolita Marksiti (who was white) in the Soviet Union. In fact, this was a fairly common theme of Soviet propaganda and art into at least the 1960s, which condemned segregation in the United States and portrayed the USSR as a place where multiethnic friend groups and relationships could thrive. This was also helped by the few times the USSR hosted the World Festival of Youth and Students, which would bring tens of thousands of young people from all around the world into the USSR — and with large congregations of young people comes the inevitable forming of relationships! There actually is a term for mixed race kids born from these relationships: \"festival children\", which you can read more about in this Moscow Times article Keep in mind that the Soviet Union was explicitly a multinational state, which recognized dozens of ethnic groups and sought to eliminate long-existing ethnic tensions. This is not to say ethnic conflict had been eliminated (it certainly still existed!), but the USSR was not actively outlawing interracial or interethnic relationships. In terms of Black people in the USSR, Russia does have a decently-sized Afro-Russian community, and a portion of this community came from interracial relationships in the Soviet period (some others include people who migrated to the Soviet Union on their own, or those who have migrated in the post-Soviet period). Again, you can read more about this in the previous \"festival children\" article, but also in the articles I will link below (especially that by Joy Gleason Carew, who on p. 212 cites a figure of ~4000 descendants in 2006). African women were naturally also allowed to attend international universities and trade schools in the USSR (in fact, I\\'ll link a photo from 1961 here and another one here However, Constantin Katsakioris (in the article linked below, on p. 287) notes that the USSR had trouble recruiting female students, and by 1969 only 15.4% of students at Patrice Lumumba University were female. Of these female students, only around 10% were from Sub-Saharan Africa, and 6.3% from the Middle East or North Africa. If you\\'re interested in reading more about this, I can recommend these articles, which I have quoted from above: Joy Gleason Carew\\'s \"Black in the USSR: African diasporan pilgrims, expatriates and students in Russia, from the 1920s to the first decade of the twenty-first century (African and Black Diaspora, vol. 8 no. 2) tracks the history of Black migrants to the USSR from the 1920s onwards, including the rise in international education during the 1950s-1960s, and also focuses on souring interethnic relationships towards the fall of the Soviet Union. This may help answer your \"daily life\" question, which I don\\'t necessarily feel qualified to answer on its own as it could be subjective. Constantin Katsakioris\\' \"The Lumumba University in Moscow: higher education for a Soviet–Third World alliance, 1960–91 (Journal of Global History vol. 14 no. 2) specifically gives a history of the Patrice Lumumba University from its opening to the fall of the Soviet Union. As for your follow up question, Black Americans were allowed to go to school in the USSR, although I am unsure how common this was. I myself am Canadian, and the older people I know who attended school in the USSR (either as Canadian or American citizens) did so as part of training programs for Communist organizations. There were Black Americans recruited to work in the USSR (moreso during the pre-war period), but most articles about international education in the USSR focus on students from the Third World. I\\'ll refrain from answering this question, but perhaps another person can provide sources on non-ideologically-focused education for Americans in the USSR. You might also be interested in the fact that similar schools existed in other socialist countries: for example, according to the book \"The German Democratic Republic: 10 Years United Nations Membership\", in 1981 alone around 13,000 students from \"Third World\" countries (mostly Africa and the Middle East) enrolled in vocational training in East Germany, and around 50,000 people in developing countries had already received training from the DDR at the time. There were an additional 2062 students from Africa, Asia, and the Middle East completing higher education degrees at East German universities in 1981 that aren\\'t counted in these figures, and a further 1519 that had received their degrees that year (p. 67 of the aforementioned book). I hope this gives a bit of background for further reading!',\n",
       " \"This is a great question! I have lots to say that I can’t all fit here, but happy to answer more questions afterwards as need. Also, this is my first time answering a post here, so hopefully this is all within guidelines. There is a very interesting Soviet comedy called Circus , which is about an American circus performer who gives birth to a black child, and flees to the Soviet Union to escape the racist backlash. The final scene is this black child (held up as simba in the lion king) being passed between various ethnic groups showing demonstrating the harmony that exists between various races within the USSR. So, what is the basis of this? The Soviet Union invited intellectuals and workers from Black America, Africa and Asia to work and study there. Many famous Marxist and anticolonial figures went through KUTV, the Communist University of the Toilers of East which trained revolutionaries, including Ho Chi Minh, Deng Xiaoping, Manabendra Nath Roy, Harry Haywood… There were also exchange programs with other friendly countries (usually Third world or recently independent from colonial rule). Woman could and did attend University. Of course, this needs to be contextualized as part of the cultural front of the Cold War being waged between capitalist and social ideologies. The Soviet Union, as Monica Popescu points out, aimed to attract intellectuals disenfranchised with capitalistic cultural production in the name of creating an alternative aesthetic. In the Post-War years, the Soviet Union trained students from Africa, Latin America, Black America, and Asia for this purpose. To give some background information on the Soviet Union’s relationship with Black America: the Soviet Union initially seemed like a natural ally for Black America, and vice versa. While racism is hardwired into the foundations of America, the USSR had completely different founding myths. In its ideological conception as a multiethnic socialist state, it is internationally focused, with racism officially forbidden and socially taboo (regardless of the continuation of personal prejudice). It naturally seems to hold itself up a mirror to both colonialism and American racism. Maxim Matusevich writes in “Harlem Globetrotters: African-American Travelers in Stalin’s Soviet Union”, the Soviet Union saw Black visitors as natural allies, as American racism is part of its particular version of capitalist oppression. 1922 saw the Fourth Comintern Congress, which included Otto Huiswood as part of the CPUSA and famous Jamaican writer Claude McKay as a non-communist observer and participant. Additionally, this also led to Black American recruits to be trained as revolutionary organizers at the Stalin Communist University of the Toilers of the East. McKay also spoke with Trotsky on the “Negro Question”, detailed in A Long Way from Home, as well as published Negry v Amerike or Negroes in America, which served to influence Soviet engagement with Black American experiences. At the 6th International in 1926, the Comintern endorsed the Black Belt Thesis, self-determination for Black peoples in America. They also hired Black specialists, agriculturalists and engineers in the USSR that could not get jobs in America, and trained artists, filmmakers, and supported literary initiatives, being the main funder of the Afro-Asian Writers Association and permanent Bureau, the first conference of which DuBois attended in 1958 (Dubois travelled to the Soviet Union multiple times and wrote highly of it his whole life). Langston Hughes also famously travelled to the Soviet Union. In June 1932, he came in a group of 22 young Black Americans to make a film called Black and White, about labour and race relations in the American south. Hughes describes in I Wonder as I Wander the moment the band of 22 first arrive in Moscow, the promised land of the Soviets where race prejudice was unacceptable, “a few of the young black men and women left the train to touch their hands to Soviet soil, lift the new earth in their palms, and kiss it” . In Moscow, the group were honored guests, staying at a hotel reserved for higher ranking party members, seeing theatre normally difficult to get tickets for unless you were a heavy industry worker, and were paid weekly salaries which (at least for Hughes), had about 100x more buying power in Russia than he was ever paid in America. When the film project fell apart the actors were offered exit visas at the time of their choosing, work in the Soviet Union, or extended travel visas. Hughes took this opportunity to travel to Soviet Central Asia, Turkmenistan, to see the part of the Soviet Union where most of the colored population lived. In general, visiting Black Americans had far more privileges than the average Soviet citizen, and far more freedom of movement. That Hughes manages to secure a travel permit to Soviet Central Asia is itself a sign of these special privileges, given that a travel permit was valid everywhere except the Central Asian Soviet Republics (one interesting side effect of this was that writers such as Dubois or Hughes didn't easily recognize the contradictions, exclusions and violence with the with Soviet Union, but this is another discussion). In his travelogue A Negro looks at Soviet Central Asia Hughes will comment extensively on the cotton production near Tashkent (modern day capital of Uzbekistan). The Soviet Union had invited Black agricultural specialists and engineers, a team that worked under specialist and KUTVA student (the University of the Toiler’s of the East), Oliver Golden. Golden had been unable to find specialist work in America, but the Soviet Union sought out skilled Black American labour. Golden was paid 700 US dollars a month. If anyone remembers the Soviet Union’s relationship to its farmers and peasants around this time, this is an enormous sum. It is also an enormously different experience to the ambivalent and often coercive relationship between agricultural producers and the Soviet state.\",\n",
       " '1/3 I’ve written tangentially about this topic in this other answer, which was about race and ethnicity in the USSR more generally and have borrowed some sentences and phrasing from myself to use in this one. This is within the plagiarism guidelines of the sub, but I want to state it explicitly. ___ So, the direct, not-beating-around-the-bush answers are: pretty normal but sometimes really not; pretty well but sometimes really not; not in your personal life but possibly in the media; no; legally nothing but socially something; no, or at least not because they were black; not applicable. So as you can see, we’re going to have to beat around the bush a little. Foreign students were probably at their most visible during the Khrushchev Thaw and the late USSR, but their history actually extends throughout the Soviet Union. Lenin’s contributions to the theory of Marxism famously include his explanation of imperialism and colonialism as \"the highest stage of capitalism\", so after the success of the October Revolution, he and other Bolsheviks intended to transform the RSFSR and later the USSR into the vanguard of not just socialist revolution, but also racial equality and decolonization. In the late 1920s, this would take more concrete form with the policy of korenizatsiya, which I wrote about here But even before then, the ideal of international cooperation found expression in the Communist University of the Toilers of the East, or in its Russian initials, KUTV. KUTV was founded in 1921, under Lenin. It was first intended to be a technical school sending qualified engineers out to modernize their home republics, but about a third of the student body was from outside the USSR, including students from multiple African countries. So what was life at KUTV, and in Moscow more generally in the 1920s, like for African students? Well, sadly, I don’t think anyone has actually produced a study of their perspectives. But we can say a few things about the environment they would have found themselves in. Moscow was even more predominantly Russian then than now, which may have made feelings of otherness and isolation even worse, but foreign students would have lived in dormitories administered by their universities, and since KUTV explicitly admitted minoritized ethnicities, Africans were at least able to share their plight with their co-students. Although he was neither African nor a student, Claude McKay’s case is one of the best examples we have of what a Black man thought of the Soviet Union’s claim to racial equality in the 1920s. The other answers have already discussed McKay’s actual experiences in the USSR, what he did and who he talked to, but we can go a little more into what he actually thought about those experiences. And oh boy, did he gush about them. He even described it as a \"magic pilgrimage\", he was so impressed; there was no housing segregation, no being forced to sit at the back of the bus, no lynching. Part of that is because visitors of McKay’s international stature were few, and they all got rooms at the best hotels, enthusiastic gala receptions, and were explicitly to be protected by the police. But even for less famous guests, things compared favorably to the US, and especially the Jim Crow South. Even for those not booked hotels by the state, housing segregation was never even close to policy. Even for your average unknown Black visitor, Russians would often \"willingly vacate their seats on public transport to accommodate a \\'Negro comrade\\'\" (Matusevich 2008, 61f). By no means were the majority of Black visitors and migrants celebrities, though. Engineers, agricultural experts from Tuskegee, and even laborers and mail carriers could move to the USSR and often do better than they would have back in the Depression-era US. (For more on the USSR’s insulation from the Depression, I recommend this post by u/kieslowskifan.) They often remained for years, as well, so \"visitors\" is a bit of a misnomer in many cases. This does have a double edge to it, though. Africans, and Black people in general, were novelties in the USSR. Even if you weren’t Claude McKay, there was a fair chance you were there as an honored guest, and if you weren’t, that honor rubbed off on you by virtue of your rarity, and your status as a symbol of international fellowship, all the same. So Russian politeness on public transport should definitely be seen as genuine, but it was also because of that novelty, and because of a sense of paternalism. (Anecdote time: When I lived in Moscow, I, a young white male student, basically never sat down on the Metro, because even when there was a seat open, odds were I would just end up offering it to a woman older than me at the next station. Giving up your seat is always a sign of respect, but sometimes it also indicates socially constructed assumptions of weakness.) So I don’t believe we should consider anti-Black or anti-African racism virulent in the pre-WW2 period, because again the people who would have experienced it first-hand rarely mention instances of it. But it was by no means a post-racial utopia either. And as Soviet policy developed, more African students came to the USSR, and their novelty wore off, the rose-colored glasses slipped as well. Later in Stalin’s life, the USSR became more isolationist and inwardly-focused, so things remained broadly the same, if even less eventful, for Africans and Black Americans in the USSR. KUTV was closed and foreign student hosting was cancelled in the late 1930s, as Stalinist paranoia reached its peak, and no American celebrities would be quite as vaunted by the Soviet press after the mid 1930s — although Langston Hughes’ and Paul Robeson’s Soviet experiences in the early 1930s do mark a last, highest hurrah for Soviet adulation of Black western cultural figures. The second major moment in this history comes after Stalin’s death, in the Khrushchev Thaw. Khrushchev’s reforms and liberalizations were accompanied by a turn outwards and a renewed interest in Africa and Asia, for their geopolitical significance but also for their rhetorical value. That meant a propaganda push in those \"Third-World\" nations, but also an increase in the number of students who would be invited to the USSR. Ghana’s independence in 1957 was the beginning, though perhaps not the spark, of a massive wave of decolonization in sub-Saharan Africa and of a blossoming of African socialist movements. It also coincided with the 1957 World Festival of Youth and Students, which inaugurated in the Soviet consciousness a new tone for its relations with Africa. As more nations gained independence, the USSR offered educational opportunities to students from more and more of them. There were students from ten African countries in 1958; by 1968, there were students from forty-six (Guillory, 273). Exactly how cynically realpolitik this move was is one of those issues that historians will probably never solve definitively — I tend to think it had origins in an earnest desire to help, but you can make a strong case otherwise too — but it was certainly paternalistic in its language, claiming to \"help the downtrodden,\" among other clichés (Guillory, 273). The paternalism filtered through to the students in question, although it didn’t exactly rule their lives either. Students from non-Russian backgrounds, including Africans, were given a certain amount of extracurricular help such as tutoring or special language lessons, which certainly did help them academically, especially considering many didn’t speak perfect Russian. The fact that the help was portrayed rhetorically as a \"benevolent gesture\" definitely created a \"patronizing ... \\'white man\\'s burden\\'\" atmosphere for the African students who received it (Walke, 305). The frequency with which Soviet citizens, official and unofficial alike, asserted the superiority of the USSR over the West also contributed to a feeling that everything was being done for show, to prove a point. The Soviet citizens in question may have honestly believed they were combating imperialism, but it relied on the same unspoken assumptions of African backwardness, with the difference being an assertion that only the USSR was truly committed to ameliorating them. Students were not really treated as propaganda pieces, at least not in their own lives and not as individuals. Propaganda about international brotherhood found plenty of expression in news media and in the form of party-organized festivals such as Komsomol Congresses, where everybody was supposed to be on display and were only elevated above that baseline level of on-display-ness if they’d been specifically selected to take part in a dance performance or something of the like. So there was no need to use individuals for that purpose. But exams sometimes seemed awfully easy, lessons comically doctrinaire, professors either much too accommodating or oddly strict on the smallest failures; that they would be blamed if a foreign student failed goes a long way to explaining both their willingness to help and their tendency to snap. So paternalism was not something African students could fail to see, but it was more of an undercurrent than a sustained wave.',\n",
       " 'There are a couple of issues. The major reason is that this was not a rumor during the period. As far as I can tell, Harriss is the only scholar who has drawn this conclusion; most seem to accept that Edmund Beaufort was \"close\" to Catherine of Valois in some way before her marriage to Owen Tudor, and that Beaufort was likely her son\\'s godfather (as it was common for a child to be given a godparent\\'s name). They don\\'t even reference it as discredited scandal. So - boom. Another is that Henry\\'s claim to the throne was not through his mother, it was through his father. The Beaufort bloodline, despite ultimately going back to Edward III through John of Gaunt, was not helpful to Henry at all: the initial generation of Beauforts had been born to John of Gaunt and Kathryn Swynford out of wedlock, and while John later legitimized them and Parliament acknowledged their right to inherit, Henry IV (John\\'s son, and their half-brother) barred them from the throne. As a result, Henry VII did not use his Beaufort ancestry to justify his right to the throne, and having a second line of Beaufort ancestry would have been worthless. Catherine of Valois herself was his claim, regardless of the man who fathered her younger children: they had status because of her, not because of their father. She was a former Queen of England and the mother of a king. It would also have been very problematic to suggest that Catherine of Valois had borne a child out of wedlock, and that Henry VII\\'s father was actually illegitimate. For one thing, chastity was considered one of the chief virtues of a noblewoman and particularly of a queen - it was far from uncommon in western Europe for people who couldn\\'t criticize a king to accuse his queen of taking lovers, or for a queen who failed politically to be sexually linked to a man she\\'d \"failed\" with (Isabeau of Bavaria and the Duke of Orleans; Isabella of France and Roger Mortimer) - so he would be seen as insulting his own grandmother vilely. Then, if he were to treat this theory as true, he would be absolutely not helping his case, because now his father would be illegitimate and unable to inherit the claim to the throne from Catherine.',\n",
       " '\"Firestorm\" has a spectrum of meanings. With the broadest meanings, it is used to refer to almost any large and destructive conflagration. With a narrow meaning, it is restricted to fires that produce a large surface-level radial inflow of air at high speeds (e.g., 100-200km/hr or more), which feeds a large rising convective columns which reaches an altitude of many kilometres. Using this narrow definition, there are three confirmed urban firestorms known, all from bombing during WWII: Hamburg, Dresden, and Hiroshima (and three additional possible firestorms: Kassel and Darmstadt in Germany, and Ube in Japan). The are multiple accounts by witnesses of all three confirmed firestorms of the hurricane-force winds, and some accounts of people being sucked in. Mathematical/computational modelling of firestorms confirms that such high winds are to be expected, when the right conditions are met (which is not often, which is why there were relatively few firestorms in WWII despite repeated efforts to produce them). Accounts of the winds are generally not exaggerated. Multiple witnesses described them, and they are theoretically expected. In addition to the urban cases, firestorms have resulted from large forest fires, also with very high wind speeds. The POW you mention is probably Victor Gregg, author of Dresden: A Survivor\\'s Story, February 1945 (Bloomsbury, 2013). He describes the winds in his book, and has also described them in interviews. Gregg was captured during the Battle of Arnhem, and was one of the few people whose life was saved by the bombing of Dresden - he was sentenced to death at the time, due to be executed the day after the bombing. He escaped during the bombing and took part in the firefighting and rescue effort, witnessing the raid and the firestorm. The most famous witness in the English-speaking world was Kurt Vonnegut, who spent the raid in Dresden, but sheltered in an underground meat locker - he witnessed the aftermath, but not the raid itself. His experiences were the basis of his novel Slaughterhouse-Five. Vonnegut isn\\'t your witness, since he didn\\'t see the raid and the winds, just the destruction and death that resulted.',\n",

       " 'It\\'s hard to adjust for inflation because the cost of living differed greatly from place to place - just as it does today. The American West was expensive; the South was not. The famed \\'49ers hoped to \"make their pile,\" meaning they wanted enough to return home or to the Midwest to buy a farm. $10k was regarded as the goal - representing about 35-40 pounds of gold. A few of the \\'49ers achieved this. It was better odds than the lottery, but it wasn\\'t as good as many of the games at the casino. The \\'49ers worked in small teams and relied on labor and luck rather than on sophisticated technology. With little invested upfront, they hoped to turn muscle power into wealth, and at the outset, the California Gold Country was filled with enough gold to allow for hundreds to \"make their pile.\" Western gold mining eventually shifted from the extensive exploration and working of broad swaths of territory to the pursuit of intensive gold veins that led underground. This required sophisticated technology and laborers. Underground mining also allowed for lucky owners to become millionaires - something that was not possible among the early surface gold miners. Here, we can glimpse what the price of gold meant with regarded to \"subsistence of a family.\" The Comstock mines in Nevada were remarkable for paying at least $4 per day for underground miners. Elsewhere, this was often $3 or $3.50 per day. Henry Colt in his factory in Hartford, Connecticut proudly paid workers a remarkable $1.25 per day - 10 or 12 hours while Comstock miners worked 8 hours per day. Canal ditch diggers in the 1840s/50s earned fifty or seventy-five cents per 12-hour day - barely subsistence wages. That\\'s the spectrum that one encountered in the mid nineteenth century. Miners who earned $4 per day were earning about the equivalent of one of a half ounces of gold for a six-day week - and they were living very well at that. Consider that as the equivalent of a modern skilled factory worker making $200 per day (thanks to unions!).',\n",

But they helpfully provide both calculators based on historical price series, and also the explanation for which calculations might best suit your needs. In your example, we come to an important fork in the road quite early: are we interested in the gold, or in the $USD that gold buys? Since you\\'re talking about subsistence for a family, I assume the latter. $18.95, reflated via the consumer price index to the present day , is about $405. If you want to get a sense of \"about how much is that in terms of supporting a family,\" that\\'s the number you probably want. It\\'s not perfect; the basket of goods you buy to support a family looks more than a little different in 2020 than in 1800.

One of the very first things the Bolsheviks did was to seize all Banks and more importantly, cancel all Czarist debts. Banks fundamentally work by loaning and borrowing money. They issue loans, then make money when the loans are paid along with interest. If this is insufficient, they borrow money from other Banks. In other words, by cancelling Czarist debts, the Bolsheviks denied the so called Bankers their income. The idea that the Bolsheviks would borrow money from hated Capitalists, or that Capitalists would lend money to people who\\'ve openly stated their intent to destroy them, is idiotic. Second, the US State Department Documents tell the whole story.

On the contrary, when Boris Kamenka, one of the main bankers of the Provisional Government (more on this later) was forced to flee Russia after the Bolshevik Revolution (where, as mentioned above, the Bolsheviks seized or shut down all Banks), the US based Banker Jacob Schiff (who happened to be Jewish) asked the US to provide him and the Anti Bolshevik Russian Czarists/Whites (who were also Antisemitic) all possible financial support \"to prevent Bolshevik Devastation\" The thing is, the people who peddle the conspiracy Don\\'t know a thing about Russian history. They don\\'t understand the simple concept that there were multiple Russian Revolutions. One in 1905 after the Russo Japanese war, the 1917 February Revolution that overthrew the Czar and installed the Russian Provisional Government, and the October Bolshevik Revolution of that same year. It was the FEBRUARY 1917 revolution that enjoyed support from US based Bankers, Including Jacob Schiff. And even then, it was limited. The US State Department records show that when Schiff was asked, he refused to provide any loans because all focus was on American War loans, as it was WWI at the time. If any US based Bankers did support the FEBRUARY Revolution, it was because the Czar was deeply unpopular and many segments of the Population were turning against them. They saw the winds of change, and more importantly that the Provisional Government was willing to continue the War (something that the Bolsheviks opposed). That\\'s it. Any so called Bankers who supported the February Revolution did NOT support the Bolshevik Revolution of October, because the reasons stated above (Hatred if Capital and Banks, and cancelling Czarist or Provisional Government loans) made them prima facie incompatible, ideologically.

       " \"While we wait for someone more versed in the French side of the conflict to make a recommendation, I can suggest The Diary and Letters of Gouverneur Morris, vol. 1 who lived through most of it as our fourth Minister to France. While he gained that title in June of 1792, he actually landed in France 27 Jan 1789, a Tuesday, after 40 days travelling (Jefferson left Sept 1789 and William Short served as Minister between the two). The Bastille would be overrun about six months later and at one point in the chaos his wooden leg got him out of a pinch; Owing to this accident of losing a leg, when he was presented at Court at Paris he asked to be allowed to appear without a sword, and, though a serious departure from court etiquette, the favor was granted. During one of the years of his ministry in Paris, when carriages were abolished as being aristocratic, and the chances were against the escape of any person discovered driving in one, Morris, who seems always to have defied the mob though by no means averse to saving his life, drove through the streets followed by hoots and cries of, “An aristocrat,” and, quietly opening the door of his carriage, thrust out his wooden leg, and said: “An aristocrat! yes, truly, who lost his leg in the cause of American liberty;” whereat followed great applause from the mob. I've read some more outlandish versions of the tale, but that's the story from this book. It's generally considered the best American account of the events of the French Revolution as they happened.

       " 'I have a couple of recommendations for you on music history! Most of my examples are about Britain because that is my own area of study. The Democratic Muse: Folk Music Revival in Scotland by Ailie Munro. This book provides an excellent analysis and introduction of the history of folk music revival in Scotland. The folk revival is a phenomenon which affected many different countries in the mid-20th century, and it\\'s had a big impact on how \"Celtic\" music is understood as a genre today. By going through the political ideologies behind the evolution of the movement in Scotland, Munro brings out the specific ideas that shaped what was considered \"folk music\" during this crucial period. There\\'s also a great chapter by Morag MacLeod about how the revival differed in Gaelic language music at a time when the Gaelic language was starting to experience a serious decline. Songs of Gaelic Scotland by Anne Lorne Gillies. While this book is more focused on presenting the lyrics and tunes of songs, each song comes with a historical context section. The earliest songs in the volume go back to the days of the clan bards in the 17th century, so you can trace the evolution of the Gaelic song tradition over time and across different occupations by going through the book. Reeling Roosters and Dancing Ducks: Celtic Mouth Music by Heather Sparling. This book looks at a specific genre of Gaelic music known as puirt-à-beul, or mouth music (literally \"music out of the mouth\"). It involves singing tunes very quickly to accompany dancing. In particular, Sparling focuses on the practice among Gaelic diaspora communities in Canada. If you\\'re interested in how ethnic music survives and changes in diaspora communities, this one is a good one to check out. Singing the Gospel Along Scotland’s North-East Coast, 1859-2009 by Frances Wilkins. I highly recommend this book about sacred song among fishing communities in Northeast Scotland and the Northern Isles. Wilkins looks at how music intersected with economic, social, and religious changes across a century and a half of Scottish history. Blackface Minstrelsy in Britain by Michael Pickering. This is a really thought-provoking book about how and why blackface minstrel shows remained popular in England even longer than they did in the United States - well into the 1970s! Pickering looks at how musical performances that romanticized agricultural life in the American South tied into anxieties in Britain about urbanization as well as its fading imperial glory. Rhythms of Labour: Music at Work in Britain by Marek Korcyznski, Michael Pickering, and Emma Robertson. Really interesting overview of the history of people singing while working in Britain. It covers from the early modern period through the 20th century. So there\\'s a big range of things like singing during agricultural labour in Shakespeare\\'s time, all the way up to singing to the radio in factories. Selling Songs and Smiles: The Sex Trade in Heian and Kamakura Japan by Janet R. Goodwin. Here\\'s a non-British example! This is an excellent book about the history of singing entertainers in the sex trade in medieval Japan. The asobi were singing prostitutes who entertained Heian nobles while they were on pilgrimages. Goodwin looks at how attitudes towards them varied throughout the medieval period, as well as the emergence of different types of singing female entertainers.',\n",
       " \"In short, no. Christian stance against suicide largely results from the interpretation of the Ten Commandments, with St. Augustine pointing out, that the Fifth Commandment being formulated as 'you should not kill' also covers suicide, because it does not apply only to other people, as the Eighth Commandment 'you shall not bear false witness against your neighbor'. This was later upheld by St. Thomas who wrote that suicide contradicts the natural self-love, is damaging to a community and is both a rejection of a divine gift of life and interference in the God's right to end one's existence and thus is an act of hubris. It is quite interesting that St. Thomas' stance echoes some of the reservations towards suicide expressed by Aristotle and Plato. Suicide has been official condemned as a serious sin on the First Council of Braga in 561 that mandated all priests to deny people who committed that deed a funeral on the church grounds. In 860, pope Nicholas I officially classified suicide as a mortal sin that would result in eternal damnation. This notions were also more or less in line with the ancient Greek attitudes towards suicide. For example, Aristotle was critical of suicide, stating in Nicomanichean Ethics (V.26) that 'killing oneself as a way to escape poverty, love or sorrow is a sign of cowardice rather than courage, because fleeing from difficulties characterizes weakness, so the death is being chosen not because it is morally acceptable but because it merely allows to avoid an obstacle'. In Eudemian Ethics (IV.25) he also adds that people who actively seek death are morally depraved by definition, which sentiment is quite similar to the notions expressed by Plato. The latter summarily discusses suicide in two of his works. In Phaedo (61b-62c), he presents Socrates as generally sympathetic towards Pythagorean attitude that universally condemned suicide, because it is an act against Gods who have put the soul in human bodies as a form of punishment. In Laws he states explicitly that suicide is a deplorable act and people who committed it should not be given proper burial but rather be buried in an unmarked grave. He makes a provision, however, that this should not be applied to people who were insane, found themselves in an irrecoverable position (e.g. were terminally ill), had to kill themselves as form of judicial punishment (as was the ultimate fate of Socrates) or were gravely ashamed of grossly immoral actions. He notes, however, that although these were mitigating circumstances, suicide would still be an act unworthy of a moral person, being only a final act resulting from a depraved life. Romans, although generally not condemning the suicide of the free citizens on the moral grounds, outlawed the suicide in several cases that had direct economic consequences. The first one was the suicide of people sentenced of capital crimes (as the state could not have seized their property without the verdict), although this law was applied quite liberally. The second was the suicide of a soldier, as the Laws of Rufus mention them among the acts illegal for a soldier and consider them act of cowardice equal to desertion. The third was a suicide of a slave, with an additional provision that if a slave took their life within six month from being bought, the buyer could have demanded a refund from the seller. Furthermore, an assumption that peasants were living in misery is a misconception that lacks any historical backing and stems largely from the presentistic direct projection of modern standards of onto the past. Peasants were generally neither poor or lived in squalor (from our standpoint they wight have been were, but so have large part of the nobility). They formed the large majority of the society and one can say that until the proliferation of urban centres that started in early 13th century, they were a baseline for an 'average medieval person'. Sure, some were poor, but some were well-to-do and the rest fell somewhere in between. Furthermore, in the Early Middle Ages, when the Christianity was being slowly adopted across Europe, the grasp of the rulers over the local population was far from absolute, with the settlements being largely independent and participating in the mutual exchange, e.g. providing goods and service in exchange for protection, what over time evolved into mechanism that is generally described as feudal relationship. From the ideological point of view, adoption of the negative attitudes towards suicide were not necessarily a good way to dissuade subjects, as the reception of Christianity among the common folk was a relatively slow process and pretty much never displaced various folk beliefs that fared quite well along the Christian ones during the entire medieval period. It should be also noted that such action was hardly necessary, because folk beliefs, remnants of which can be tracked down to the late Middle Ages (i.e. they were attested as early as that period) were generally pretty much consistent with Christian ones, when it comes to taking one's life. If we assume that such belief stem from the pre-Christian times, then suicide was largely shunned even then, as a substantial part of the supernatural beings in European folklore, especially in Central and Eastern part of the continent were believed to be souls of people who committed suicide. Association of the existence of dangerous beings such as rusalkas or upirs with suicide strongly suggests that the latter was shunned by traditional folk morality across Europe. This also makes sense from the economical point of view, as sudden death of a family member, especially young and healthy one, decreased the working potential of the family, putting it at a risk of famine, especially for the older members, who were unable to work as efficiently or even work at all. So to sum it up, there is not much evidence that the suicide was imposed on the Christian commoners as a way to prevent the suicides, because nothing indicates that it has been in any way prevalent or accepted in the late Antiquity or Middle Ages. It was rather a natural consequence of the moral condemnation of killing that was also present in various religions and moral systems.\",\n",
       " \"I've never been wholly pleased with my past answers on this topic, but here are the ones I'm least unenthused about: What became of the God Worshipping Society after the fall of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom? Questions about the Taiping Rebellion? The basic problem is that the primary sources seem lacking at best, and on top of that – and largely in consequence – the scholarship is just as thin. We have some information about the postwar fortunes of individual ex-Taipings, some of whom, like Hong Xiuquan's nephew Hong Quanfu, remained anti-Qing rebels long term. But information about their religion is pretty limited beyond awareness that, for instance, Hong Quanfu almost certainly died a Protestant, as he is buried in the Protestant cemetery in Happy Valley, Hong Kong. Aside from a lack of material there's just a general air of uncertainty. There's no clear consensus on the religiosity of the Taiping subject population; the extent to which they saw themselves as Christians as opposed to part of a broader and more locally-rooted continuum of heterodox sectarians; the rough number of survivors; how many emigrated as opposed to stayed; et cetera. The above-linked answers say the same at greater length.\",\n",
       " \"I would probably argue that many historians used to take a top-down approach to discussing life under the Regime. Different interpretive choices have also coexisted and continue to do so. I would not regard De Felice and Santarelli – to cite two, quite opposite, examples of Italian historiography of Italian Fascism – as falling within the same interpretive model, even if they both rely heavily on what can be described as “top-down” inference process. Traditional historiography – at times improperly, referred to as “neo-Rankean” - and firm Marxist “structuralism” - both have a tendency to regard certain sources as spurious, or anecdotal, and therefore less valuable in outlining a general picture. Leaving aside the – quite dated – controversy over the issue of “consensus/consent”, and looking at the various historiographical schools and currents from a considerable distance, I do not believe there is a definitive answer as to what way works best in providing a proper understanding of “Fascism”. The economical sphere, the organization of the production process, demographics; political parties and currents of the public opinion; diplomacy and military matters; all represent portions of a picture which begins to make sense in its relation to the lives of the people who inhabited it. But one probably needs all those things together. As I was writing the other day, I do believe that any interpretive choice needs to be evaluated in its relations to the concrete historical process under examination, and especially in so far as what relations it's able to illuminate and, in some way, to create. As the “historical process” is ultimately composed by people in their individual and collective relations to “time”, there certainly is a need for “everyday life”. This is not really absent in traditional historiography either. There's a footnote in Vivarelli's Storia delle origini del fascismo (vol. 2 I think) which has always stuck with me; because it's inclusion – from a “traditional” perspective – would feel almost gratuitous. It's a brief excerpt from the funerary speech for a young women who had died of a work related illness, delivered by one coworker – a friend – of hers. It speaks of “socialism” and hope, but gives the reader nothing to reinforce Vivarelli's general argument; but, even in a book that had to contend with the publisher for the excessive footnoting (Italian publishing didn't work the same as British and American), I can see why he didn't cut that one. More recently, a historian who certainly doesn't belong to the “new wave” of Fascist studies, such as R. Bosworth, has authored a text on Mussolini's Italy which explicitly promises to tell us something of life under the fascist dictatorship . While his choice is (partly) driven by his polemical (albeit not entirely unwarranted) take on the current state of historiography on Italian Fascism, his intent appears more or less to provide an attempt to recreate those connections between individual experiences and “the bigger picture” that I was discussing before. To address the second part of your question, I feel that you are (at least in part) missing the point. The access to sources is indeed an issue, as Kate Ferris correctly points our in the introduction of Everyday Life in Fascist Venice , as well as a recurrent criticism leveled against every “other” historiographical approach. Sources are what they are (incidentally, there are far, far more letters and diaries from one-hundred years ago than a thousand historians can read in a lifetime). The historiographical issue is how to interpret them. To go with your example – De Felice's work on police reports in order to gauge the state of public opinion under the Regime – much maligned as it is, his work, I believe, supports his fundamental conclusion: that the Regime found no particular reasons of concern with the state of the public opinion. Given De Felice's perspective and interpretive choice, it says almost nothing else, and it's a fairly important matter, as there were moments when this concern certainly existed and motivated different actions and reactions. This limitation, though, is not inherent to the source. The source could tell us more. Marxist historians during the 1970s and 1980s have examined court records and court-martial records to find evidence of the antagonistic relations between the masses and the authority. If De Felice used police reports “as they were intended”, historians like Giorgio Rochat used them not only to challenge, but to subvert the intended meaning. Possibly opening the way to a better understanding of how the text represented a negotiated space of dialogue. The text alone – writes Ferris – cannot signify cultural praxis; it is only when we take into account the way in which readers ‘used’ the texts they read (or images they saw, or rituals they observed and participated in) that the relationship between the cultural forms represented in the text and subjective lived experience is brought to light. … Police reports may be profoundly revealing of the author's worldview, more so because they are so deeply limited in what they can discuss. They need to convey information, and meaningful information, information that is deemed meaningful by both the sender and the receiver and, possibly, understood by both ends to mean the same thing. You are unlikely to find a diary by former prefect of Ferrara S.P. describing how he felt about the actions of the fascist squads within the province. You may speculate on it based on his subsequent career, or rely on opposition sources which accused him of complicity (but this happened all the time). But you can read his telegrams to the Interior, and they tell you very clearly that the author believed the fascists were right - over the top, perhaps – but fundamentally and morally aligned with the duties of his administration. Gasti's report on Mussolini is well known. But it's not merely a source of information on Mussolini: it tells us by what means the author understood a personality of interest. Things like: does this report draw any connection between an individual's criminal behavior and their race, or gender, or religion? Once we begin asking ourselves such questions – which is very basic stuff if I can do it – then we are no longer stuck in an inevitable “top-down” approach regardless of what sources we have available. What is crucial – continues Ferris, citing Ginzburg's famous The cheese and the worms – is that although, like all historical subjects, Menocchio and his particular worldview were unique to him, his uniqueness, like that of all historical subjects, operated within determined limits. He operated within the limits of what it was possible to know and do in the time, place and milieu in which he lived: he is analysed as the ‘exceptional typical’ of his environment. Thus, from his individual story it is possible to deduce wider observations about the culture of his society, based on the parameters of thought and modes of behaviour possible. The same is true for our context of fascist dictatorship. … As noted above, I am not particularly proficient in this kind of history. I would suggest you check out Ferris' introduction and recommended readings for a more in-depth approach to methodology. But I hope this brief answer may be helpful to you. And feel free to ask for clarification if I left anything out.\",\n",
       " \"According to Goetz Aly, a German Historian, anti-Semitism was actually less Prevalent in The Wilhelmine Empire up to WW1. There was still definitely anti-Semitism. In the 1790s, Jakob Friedrich Fries (Karl Marx's dissertation adviser) had been protesting for many of the same discriminatory measures the Nazis would implement a century and a half later, such as banning of Jews from professions and restrictions on Marriages and education. Jews were not citizens and didn't have rights until 1812, when the Holy Roman Empire collapsed and the Jews were emancipated. Throughout the 19th Century, many Conservative Germans would demand the rescinding of emancipation of Jews, to the point that even in the last years of the German empire, Jews were barred from the upper levels of the Civil service and the Military. But even so, all of this was better than Elsewhere. In both Czarist Russia and even the UK, Jews were under constant threat of violence, in addition to not having any rights. This actually resulted in huge Jewish Immigration to Germany, which emancipated Jews in 1812 and gave them new opportunities that they were denied elsewhere. As Antisemitic Germany was, it was better than the alternatives. Until the eve of WW1 many European Jews would flee to Germany and the nearby Austria/Hungary, so much that the young Hitler would complain about illegal Jewish immigrants in Austria. Paradoxically, this would lead to the Nazis' version of anti-Semitism in 1933-1945. Much like Mexicans in the modern US or Various Immigrants in Modern Europe, the Nazis, Including Hitler, saw Jews as illegal aliens stealing their Jobs and opportunities, which would lead to dispossessing them followed by the Mass murder of Jews.\",\n",
       " 'Most of this is going to be very broad and ill-defined. Sources on the time period from 1911-1949 are pretty esoteric, and ignore the average Zhou. But despite this we have some pretty significant regional and international events from that time period that have come to define not just the modern history of China, but the entire world. Fall of the Qing, rise of the Republic In 1912 the Qing government formally abdicated after the signing of the Articles of Favorable Treatment. For almost all Chinese life was about to change significantly in many different ways. Starting with the elites, many landlords & other local elites found themselves with a substantial boost to their political standing. Once under the whim of the executive empire, the Republic of China\\'s constitution and newly born parliament gave wealthy elites the ability to participate with more political agency. While most of us think of warlords automatically after the Qing, during the period of ~1912-1917 a strong bureaucracy made up of former Qing politicians ran many of the provinces south of Hebei. A well documented example of this is the governorship of Li Yuanhong in Hubei immediately following the 1911 revolution. Li himself was a leader in the Qing New Army and one of the higher ranking officers to order his units defection from the Qing. Li became appointed as governor of the province because of his martial expertise; Yuan Shikai was still marching south with Qing forces at this point. But in order to keep the local economy running and the troops paid and fed, Li was forced to cooperate with the local gentry who propped him up. So despite his position, Li was rather politically weak and would remain so even as he became president after Yuan. After the death of Yuan , things deteriorated quickly. The republic had always been weak from birth, but a series of political calamities, including an attempted restoration of the Qing in 1917, took China to the path towards warlordism, taking power away from politically independent gentry, and granting it to local military officers. For nationalists and revolutionaries (mainly students) life was uncertain. The lucky ones found themselves exiled (usually to Japan), the more unfortunate facing death sentences or assassination attempts. Many students again left China to join revolutionary cliques in Japan or in Chinatowns across South East Asia. They would continue their studies, learning from older revolutionaries like Sun, observing Westernization in Japan, or temporarily heading to the West itself to uncover its secrets of modernization. Your average peasant was potentially subjected to all sorts of atrocities. When warlords brought conflict the usual wartime atrocities began: the raping, burned/destroyed goods, murder of civilians, forced migration, etc. China was a failed state, so unless you had money and the means to leave the nation or at least seek refuge somewhere safer (like Shanghai) you were stuck and subjected to the arbitrary whims of whatever local warlord was calling the shots that day. Taxes were high in order to support the constant state of war. And of course there was the looming fear of Japanese invasion. Japan invaded and conquered Qingdao in 1914, and began encroaching on Chinese borders soon after. In 1915 Japan had forced Yuan into agreeing to most of the original 21 Demands, which gave Japan huge economic monopolies across parts of Eastern China. People were losing their jobs, or being paid less under new management. KMT rule The 1920s saw the rise of the KMT and in 1926 they completed their military conquest of most of China, retaking Beijing and becoming the legitimately recognized government of China. This had the benefit of stabilizing things for most of Eastern China, but Japanese aggression still followed. In 1931 Manchuria was annexed by Japan, and in 1932 a skirmish broke out between Nationalist and Japanese troops in Shanghai. There were strikes and protests continuing both against Japan and the increasingly oppressive KMT. Many young intellectuals and revolutionary minded Chinese fled to CCP enclaves, and civil war returned to China in 1927. For the communist students across China and many urban workers, this was a very politically active time in their lives. Boycotts broke out nearly every year from 1925-1936 across China, usually directed at Japanese goods, sometimes all foreign goods. But with the focus on its cities, generally life for the urban elites who remained loyal to the KMT was good during this period. The communists generally began staying away from the cities in China after they realized their efforts failed there, and returned to the country, where conflict resumed. There was probably a feeling of malaise by many urban elites regardless due to Japan, but the increasingly modernizing China brought some nice luxury perks for those who could afford it. Especially in the cosmopolitan Shanghai, it wasn\\'t uncommon to see wealthy Chinese driving cars, wearing fine jewelry and using perfumes to go out to the theatre. Even the poor urban workers caught a break from constant conflict. In more rural areas, the military and ideological conflicts continued. peasants were picking sides as CCP agents and KMT troops began moving across the fields. The KMT ran several \"encirclement\" campaigns to root out communist influence, many of which ended in indiscriminate slaughter of civilians. Though for the most part these campaigns slowed down in the mid-30\\'s, and KMT victory was all but assured. Things finally calmed down for a bit.',\n",
       " \"A mid-1800s enslaved man probably would have had access to alcohol, one way or another. There are examples of laws & cases against bars permitting slaves, but it wasn't a kind of nation-wide ban, certainly not an effective one. On large plantations, slaves were sometimes permitted a limited economy among each other, which sometimes included bars. In urban areas, illegal bars serving mixed clientele were something slave owners complained about fairly frequently. There's a bit of puritanical anti-alcohol belief to this, but the main reason was more that they were social settings outside the plantation owners' control. A city bar was somewhere an enslaved person could have a conversation with a free person of color, a northern preacher, or (presumed criminal) migrant workers and sailors. Legal or not, though, the bars existed. Or at least, that's true of the southeast and Atlantic seaboard. I'm not sure how much that would translate to Texas, where the movie is set. Hopefully you can get a longer answer from an expert. For discussion of independent slave economies, see Many Thousands Gone, by Ira Berlin. For the many legal complaints of the planter class, see The Southern Debate Over Slavery, edited by Loren Schweninger.\",\n",
       " 'Kingdom of Yugoslavia was defeated in the 1941 April War, mostly due to Royal Yugoslav Army having outdated weapons and tactics, and poor logistics. One story I distinctly remember is of a column of Yugoslav armored vehicles (mostly armored Škodas and some FT-35 tanks) leaving Belgrade under orders to connect with other units who had gas. The column somehow avoided Luftwaffe air raids, but when they reached their destination, there was simply no other unit there and no gas. There were units who fought with extraordinary valor (the Yugoslav air force defended Belgrade until the last of the Yugoslav pilots was shot down and by official accounts, they shot down around 40 German planes), and there were individual acts of courage (like the two naval officers who blew up their own vessel to block Italians from entering Boka Kotorska gulf). As for the post-April War resistance, it is a complex story. For one, I believe the crimes perpetrated by the Nazis and their collaborators helped the resistance gain momentum and recruit people. Most infamously, the Croatian Ustashe regime, installed by the Nazis in parts of Yugoslavia where Croats lived, massacred ethnic Serbs throughout their puppet state, and organized several death camps for Serbs, Jews and Roma (Jasenovac, Stara Gradiška, Kerestinec) and even a camp for Serbian children (Jastrebarsko)! These camps were established and manned by Ustashes themselves. The local Serb population had little choice but to join the resistance. Most of them joined the communist partisans, the rest joined the royalist chetniks (more on that later). As for the Croats who opposed to the Ustashe policy, they were persecuted and sent to the same camps, however, they were treated slightly better. Pre-war Croatian communists joined the local Serbs and formed the partisan units. In Serbia, Nazis installed a weak puppet regime which tried to save Serbs running away from Ustashe-held areas, but did nothing to protect Jewish citizens from being rounded up and sent to camps. Mind you, Nazis were distrustful of Serbs and they deliberately chose to install a weak regime there, unlike in Croatia. In Serbia, Wehrmacht did the dirty work themselves and organized punitive actions against local Serb population - 100 Serbs were to be killed for 1 dead German soldier (most infamously, Wehrmacht lined up and shot hundreds of shool children in Kragujevac as retaliation for a deadly partisan attack). Waffen SS established death camps in Serbia in Belgrade (Banjica, Staro Sajmište) and in Niš. Northern Serbia on the other hand, was given to Hungary and Hungarian fascists rounded up a thousand of local Serbs and Jews in Novi Sad, shot them and threw them into the Danube river. Macedonia was given to the Bulgarians who began an aggressive assimiliation campaign against the local Macedonian population. Macedonian language was forbidden and those who opposed were executed. Something similar happened in Slovenia, which was annexed by Germany. Slovenian language was replaced by German, however, with waay less persecution and fervor. In Bosnia, some Muslims joined the Ustashe (the Ustashe claimed that the Bosnian Muslims were \"Croats gone astray\") or the newly formed SS Handžar division. As expected, people were standing in lines to join the resistance. Now, the only question is: which one? As the veterans in Serbia usually say, the communist partisans seemed well organized and disciplined, whereas chetniks looked more like a ragtag bunch of misfits. In reality, chetnik central command lacked vision and exercised little authority over their local commanders. Many local chetnik commanders had their own politics and many perpetrated crimes. On the other hand, the partisans were highly disciplined and motivated. In the beginning, both resistance movements accepted all nationalities, however, as time passed by, chetniks gradually began to profile themselves as exclusively Serbian nationalists. In the early years, the partisans and the chetniks even fought together, but after the battle for Kraljevo, they split ways and began fighting each other. The chetniks soon contacted the Germans and offered truce and some form of cooperation in fighting the communists. So, as of 1942, the only true resistance were the partisans. Filled with Yugoslav veterans of the Spanish Civil War and of the First World War, backed by Moscow, later also supported by London, they were a highly succesful guerilla force. TL;DR Poor logistics and outdated strategy/tactics crippled the Royal Yugoslav Army in 1941, despite acts of bravery. The resistance was succesful due to atrocities committed by Nazis and their helpers. Edit: wording Edit #2: Thanks for the Silver, kind stranger!',\n",
